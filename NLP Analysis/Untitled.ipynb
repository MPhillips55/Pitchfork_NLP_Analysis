Listen to any of the canonical Bristol-scene albums of the mid-late ’90s, when the genre was starting to chafe against its boundaries, and you’d think the claustrophobic, anxious 21st century started a few years ahead of schedule. Looked at from the right angle, trip-hop is part of an unbroken chain that runs from the abrasion of ’80s post-punk to the ruminative pop-R&B-dance fusion of the moment. The best of it has aged far more gracefully (and forcefully) than anything recorded in the waning days of the record industry’s pre-filesharing monomania has any right to. Tricky rebelled against being attached at the hip to a scene he was already looking to shed and decamped for Jamaica to record a more aggressive, bristling-energy mutation of his style in ’96; the name Pre-Millennium Tension is the only obvious thing that tells you it’s two decades old rather than two weeks. And Portishead’s ’97 self-titled saw the stress-fractured voice of Beth Gibbons envisioning romance as codependent, mutually assured destruction while Geoff Barrow sunk into his RZA-noir beats like The Conversation’s Gene Hackman ruminating over his surveillance tapes. This was raw-nerved music, too single-minded and intense to carry an obvious timestamp. But Massive Attack were the origin point of the trip-hop movement they and their peers were striving to escape the orbit of, and they nearly tore themselves to shreds in the process. Instead— or maybe as a result—they laid down their going-nova genre's definitive paranoia statement with Mezzanine. The band's third album (not counting the Mad Professor-remixed No Protection) completes the last in a sort of de facto Bristol trilogy, where Tricky’s youthful iconoclasm and Portishead’s deep-focus emotional intensity set the scene for Massive Attack’s sense of near-suffocating dread. The album corroded their tendencies to make big-wheel hymnals of interconnected lives where hope and despair trade precedent—on Mezzanine, it’s alienation all the way down. There’s no safety from harm here, nothing you’ve got to be thankful for, nobody to take the force of the blow: what Mezzanine provides instead is a succession of parties and relationships and panopticons where the walls won’t stop closing in.The lyrics establish this atmosphere all on their own. Sex, in “Inertia Creeps,” is reduced to a meeting of “two undernourished egos, four rotating hips,” the focus of a failing relationship that's left its participants too numbed with their own routine dishonesty to break it off. The voice singing it—Massive Attack's cornerstone co-writer\\/producer Robert “3D” Del Naja—is raspy from exhaustion. “Dissolved Girl” reiterates this theme from the perspective of guest vocalist Sarah Jay Hawley (“Passion’s overrated anyway”). On “Risingson,” Grant “Daddy G” Marshall nails the boredom and anxiety of being stuck somewhere you can’t stand with someone you’re starting to feel the same way about (“Why you want to take me to this party and breathe\\/I’m dying to leave\\/Every time we grind you know we severed lines”). But Mezzanine’s defining moments come from guest vocalists who were famous long before Massive Attack even released their first album. Horace Andy was already a legend in reggae circles, but his collaborations with Massive Attack gave him a wider crossover exposure, and all three of his appearances on Mezzanine are homages or nods to songs he'd charted with in his early-’70s come-up. “Angel” is a loose rewrite of his 1973 single “You Are My Angel,” but it’s a fakeout after the first verse—originally a vision of beauty (“Come from way above\\/To bring me love”), transformed into an Old Testament avenger: “On the dark side\\/Neutralize every man in sight.” The parenthetically titled, album-closing reprise of “(Exchange)” is a ghostly invocation of Andy’s “See A Man's Face” cleverly disguised as a comedown track. And then there’s “Man Next Door,” the John Holt standard that Andy had previously recorded as “Quiet Place”—on Mezzanine, it sounds less like an overheard argument from the next apartment over and more like a close-quarters reckoning with violence heard through thin walls ready to break. It’s Andy at his emotionally nuanced and evocative best.The other outside vocalist was even more of a coup: Liz Fraser, the singer and songwriter of Cocteau Twins, lends her virtuoso soprano to three songs that feel like exorcisms of the personal strife accompanying her band’s breakup. Her voice serves as an ethereal counterpoint to speaker-rattling production around it. “Black Milk” contains the album’s most spiritually unnerving words (“Eat me\\/In the space\\/Within my heart\\/Love you for God\\/Love you for the Mother”), even as her lead and the elegiac beat make for some of its most beautiful sounds. She provides the wistful counterpoint to the night-shift alienation of “Group Four.” And then there's “Teardrop,” her finest moment on the album. Legend has it the song was briefly considered for Madonna; Andrew “Mushroom” Vowles sent the demo to her, but was overruled by Daddy G and 3D, who both wanted Fraser. Democracy thankfully worked this time around, as Fraser’s performance—recorded in part on the day she discovered that Jeff Buckley, who she’d had an estranged working relationship and friendship with, had drowned in Memphis’ Wolf River—was a heart-rending performance that gave Massive Attack their first (and so far only) UK Top 10 hit.Originally set for a late ’97 release, Mezzanine got pushed back four months because Del Naja refused to stop reworking the tracks, tearing them apart and rebuilding them until they’re so polished they gleam. It sure sounds like the product of bloody-knuckled labor, all that empty-space reverb and melted-together multitrack vocals and oppressive low-end. (The first sound you hear on the album, that lead-jointed bassline on “Angel,” is to subwoofers what “Planet Earth” is to high-def television.) But it also groans with the burden of creative conflict, a working process that created rifts between Del Naja and Vowles, who left shortly after Mezzanine dropped following nearly 15 years of collaboration.Mezzanine began the band’s relationship with producer Neil Davidge, who’d known Vowles dating back to the early ’90s and met the rest of the band after the completion of Protection. He picked a chaotic time to jump in, but Davidge and 3D forged a creative bond working through that pressure. Mezzanine was a document of unity, not fragmentation. Despite their rifts, they were a post-genre outfit, one that couldn’t separate dub from punk from hip-hop from R&B because the basslines all worked together and because classifications are for toe tags. All their acknowledged samples—including the joy-buzzer synths from Ultravox’s “Rockwrok” (“Inertia Creeps”), the opulent ache of Isaac Hayes’ celestial-soul take on “Our Day Will Come” (“Exchange”), Robert Smith’s nervous “tick tick tick” from the Cure’s “10:15 Saturday Night,” and the most concrete-crumbling throwdown of the Led Zep “Levee” break ever deployed (the latter two on “Man Next Door”)—were sourced from  1968 and 1978, well-traveled crate-digging territory. But what they build from that is its own beast.  Their working method never got any faster. The four-year gap between Protection and Mezzanine became a five-year gap until 2003’s 100th Window, then another seven years between that record and 2010’s Heligoland, plus another seven years and counting with no full-lengths to show for it. Not that they've been slacking: we've gotten a multimedia film\\/music collaboration with Adam Curtis, the respectable but underrated Ritual Spirit EP, and Del Naja’s notoriously rumored side gig as Banksy. (Hey, 3D does have a background in graffiti art.) But the ordeal of both recording and touring Mezzanine took its own toll. A late ’98 interview with Del Naja saw him optimistic about its reputation-shedding style: “I always said it was for the greater good of the fucking project because if this album was a bit different from the last two, the next one would be even freer to be whatever it wants to be.” But fatigue and restlessness rarely make for a productive mixture, and that same spark of tension which carried Mezzanine over the threshold proved unsustainable, not just for Massive Attack’s creativity but their continued existence.Still, it’s hard not to feel the album’s legacy resonating elsewhere—and not just in “Teardrop” becoming the cue for millions of TV viewers to brace themselves for Hugh Laurie’s cranky-genius-doctor schtick. Graft its tense feelings of nervy isolation and late-night melancholy onto two-step, and you’re partway to the blueprint for Plastician and Burial. You can hear flashes of that mournful romantic alienation in James Blake, the graceful, bass-riddled emotional abrasion in FKA twigs, the all-absorbing post-genre rock\\/soul ambitions in Young Fathers or Algiers. Mezzanine stands as an album built around echoes of the ’70s, wrestled through the immediacy of its creators' tumultuous late ’90s, and fearless enough that it still sounds like it belongs in whatever timeframe you're playing it.\"],[22721,\"Eight years, five albums, and two EPs in, the New York-based outfit Krallice have long since shut up purists about their “hipster black metal.” Their four-man, post-structural assembly line runs at a breakneck pace, taking great care to balance the intricate (Colin Marston and Mick Barr’s interlocking riffs, Lev Weinstein’s head-spinning polyrhythms) with the incendiary (best exemplified by Barr and Nick McMaster’s shared, animalistic vocal duties; the former’s a screaming eagle, the latter a growling hellhound). The quartet frequently capitalize on the element of surprise; Krallice’s last two releases—2015’s Ygg Huur and last winter’s Hyperion EP—dropped spontaneously, a pair of inter-dimensional rifts masquerading as albums, far from the hum of the hype machine. Early last month, the band opened the portal once more to announce their sixth album Prelapsarian, subsequently released sans fanfare on the Winter Solstice. Upon first glance, Prelapsarian, which the band recorded last summer, may not seem like much. Comprising four tracks and thirty-five minutes, the LP stands just a smidge taller than its predecessor, and sports a similarly dense stylistic template. Fans familiar with the stop-go surges and antiphonal touches of old will undoubtedly appreciate “Transformation Chronicles,” “Conflagration”, and “Lotus Throne,” the album’s staggered, epic triad.Hyperion’s copious lyrical references to mythology, astrophysics, and nihilistic philosophy belied an obsession with the cosmic. Prelapsarian, by contrast, is the product of a band firmly planted on terra firma, racing against the doomsday clock. Post-election anxiety runs rampant, manifested in everything from the title (derived from the age of humanity’s primordial, Edenic innocence, the original “good old days” before Adam and Eve shared a snack and sealed humanity’s grim fate), to the razed-earth panoramas framing the doomy, eight-minute-long dirge “Conflagration.” “Hate Power,” is the the album’s highlight: an odd apex, considering it’s only the second track on the album, and clocking in at less than four minutes, the shortest. Krallice songs usually sprawl out across nine, eleven minutes; in these cramped confines, Barr and McMaster stage an epic battle for control as the band totters between d-beat and death metal. Without their usual song length as a cushion, the song feels like a fight to the death in a windowless room. As the song thrashes itself nearly apart, the doomsday-clock ticking desperation is palpable. In their growing catalog, this is a relatively crisp release, a speedy little roller coaster situated alongside the Towers of Terror. But the moment is dense and terrifying enough to make Krallice fans wonder: What could they accomplish with an album of compositions this compact? \"],[22659,\"Minneapolis’ Uranium Club seem to revel in being aggressively obtuse. They sprung up last year with their Human Exploration EP, an eight-song tape of some of the most tightly-wound, gleefully mean, and well-constructed punk to grace the underground in a while. Human Exploration quickly became a must-have of the punk scene, receiving multiple vinyl pressings, all while the band rejected any web presence and most interviews as well.All of Them Naturals, their second EP, is Uranium Club indulging even more in such pranksterish qualities. The first two minutes of audio are pulled from the Nation of Ulysses handbook of sarcasm and myth-making, as a man with a vaguely British accent comments fictitiously on all the band has supposedly accomplished since its last record, from selling novelty pencils to distributing pamphlets for “pseudo-intellectual literature circles and swingers’ parties.” Uranium Club must know that people have been patiently waiting to hear more from them, and the final track of All of Them Naturals winkingly plays into that: it’s a 30-second “excerpt” of another unreleased song.In between, Uranium Club spits out some pretty damn catchy, no-frills punk rock. They have quickly garnered comparisons to Devo, particularly the twitchy neurosis of the early Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! era. It’s not unwarranted. Both bands share an affinity for guitar riffs so soaked in treble they could cut ear drums, and for attempting to shove as many starts and stops into a song as possible. “God’s Chest” is the frantic centerpiece of this release, and maybe the most directly hooky thing the band has crafted; it even incorporates some haywire synths near the end, a first for the band.Not that Uranium Club’s reference points are strictly in the past. The sour intro of “Operation Pt.II” clearly evokes Tyvek and the lo-fi punk that the Detroit outfit has been cultivating for over a decade, as do the relentless jagged hits of “The Lottery.” Contemporaries like the Coneheads (and, to a lesser extent, the enigmatic Northwest Indiana punk scene as a whole) have been melding old school punk love to the modern trash punk aesthetic, and are also here in spirit.The real secret of Uranium Club, though, is how casually talented they are. Besides the ridiculous precision of their playing, the interplay of the guitars clearly takes some notes from Wipers; the music is decidedly crude, but it’s still played with a well-honed intensity that flares up again and again. The buzzsaw solo in the middle of “Opus,” or gradual buildup and release of tension on “That Clown’s Got a Gun,” wouldn’t hit nearly as hard if it weren’t performed so forcefully here. Every song relishes in a ragged intensity, but never for a moment feels as if it could spiral out of control or fall apart, a rarity for bands in this genre.Of course, Uranium Club has the perfect mask for their technical skills: lyrics marred by a sardonic sense of humor. “The Lottery” spins a relentless tale of someone turning into an absolute monster upon hitting the jackpot, throwing everyone from their son to their mom under the bus. “Who Made the Man?,” with its constant repetition of that platitude, drives ever-darker emphasis on the consequences of your actions, from success to murder. Uranium Club is a band unafraid to toss a line like “Will you please piss on my teddy bear?” into a song for the pure sake of disorientation. The band clearly wants to keep everyone on edge. If the Uranium Club is anything, it is at least very self-aware of exactly what it is doing.\"],[22661,\"Kleenex began with a crash. It transpired one night not long after they’d formed, in Zurich of 1978, while the germinal punk group was onstage. They had but four tunes then—“Beri-Beri,” “Ain’t You,” “Heidi’s Head,” “Nice”—and at early gigs they would play them over and over to small but delighted crowds who did not want the noise to stop. When Kleenex’s original male guitarist didn’t care to continue on as such, the late Marlene Marder stepped up from the audience and swiftly found her place alongside bassist Klaudia Schifferle and drummer Lislot Ha. Marder—a literal post-punk; she delivered mail—was armed with a knowledge of two chords if not an awareness of pitch. “Lislot didn’t know that you can tune a drum kit,” Marder once said. “We played like this for a year, without tuned drum kits or a tuned bass or guitar. The guys were more ambitious so they didn’t want to play with us. For us, it was OK not because we said, ‘We’re the greatest!’ We just did as we could. Not serious in the beginning.”In all their chaos, those four songs were unusually taut. Kleenex made riotous music like a rubber band; it could tighten, or snap, or shoot in air. When some friends in the small Swiss punk scene released them as the Kleenex EP, word moved fast. The exuberant 45 made its way quickly to Britain, entering the orbit of John Peel as well as the Marxist intellectuals at the then-nascent Rough Trade label, beginning Kleenex’s affiliation with that bohemian London scene. “Ain’t You”—with its wiry riffs and chanted, pogoing hooks, its chic edge and abandon—fit well on Rough Trade’s 1980 Wanna Buy a Bridge? comp, alongside the scratchy Swell Maps and their similarly daring one-time tour mates, the Raincoats. First Songs collects Kleenex’s output from ’78 to 1982, preceding their first album (at which point they’d been forced by the tissue company to switch their perfect name—capturing the very Pop disposability of consumer culture—to LiLiPUT). The band’s lineup was constantly in flux; these songs also feature saxophonist Angie Barrack and vocalists Regula Sing and Chrigle Freund. The reissue’s title is clever; if these 24 tracks are all indeed songs, then Kleenex was reimagining what a song could be. The shortest one, the 69-second “1978,” for example, is a queasy interstitial propelled by unsparing riffs and amusingly primordial drumming. On “Eisiger Wind” (“Icy Wind”), the clangor and “OOO AHHH”s and “LA LA LA LA”s culminate with a nails-tough 15-second coda that brings to mind Mothers of Invention. But then, in Kleenex’s gleefully anarchic world, “song structures” seemed tedious.Their methods of composition were peculiar even for punk. One was extreme repetition, in which a song would progress by repeating a few minimal bars over and over, starting slowly and speeding up each time, as if running up a hill and then tumbling down it. The band punctuated their music with things like whistling and saxophones and kazoo sounds. Their guitar chords had a soured edge, and their lopsided call-and-response vocals alternately evoked stoic Patti Smith and a wayward school choir. Most crucial were the befuddlingly shredded human voices—grunted, exasperated, bloodcurdlingly shrieked, pitched so high as to pierce into the reddest red—which sounded more like a Yoko Ono Fluxus experiment than anything resembling pop. But the inquisitive core of Kleenex’s music stokes curiosity in a listener: From what plane of existence does that scream originate? Is that a person? Is that a recorder? What even is a nighttoad?The lyrics, sung in English and Swiss-German, veer between ominous images or deliberate nonsense. On “Die Matrosen” (“The Sailors”), the song’s jovial whistling is undermined by a narrative of a man in a pub who “had a blackout” and “lost control.” The combination of a grave voice with sugary ones on “Beri-Beri” skewers the lyric “and each day you feel nicer!” “Madness” is one of the most affecting Kleenex songs, with its alternately slammed and melancholy chords: “Hey madness you have touched me,” it goes, “Hey madness what do you want from me?” These emphatic early songs are fervent invocations, evidence that pure conviction could summon magic and newness from the wilderness within.The signature Kleenex songs fall together in ways that manage to approximate pop. The best one is “Hitch Hike.” “Girl was on the road to drive away\\/She had no money to pay the train,” goes the gummy, sing-song chorus. “Hitch hike ghost, don’t touch me\\/...Let me be.” Upbeat as “Hitch Hike” feels, it also touches on the necessary guardedness of being a woman in public, the adventure and risk of the female wanderer (it reminds me of Cindy Sherman’s 1979 Untitled Film Still #48). Defiant beyond its jingly form, it’s cut with the howls of a rape whistle. Not unlike their comrades in the Raincoats, Kleenex’s collective shouts were eruptions of joy as well as gestures of outsider solidarity.At the heart of Kleenex’s music is a radical sense of resourcefulness. It’s part of what helps them transcend their moment; indeed, many of the works of artier O.G. punk bands feel more potent today than those of their instigating major-label peers. Accordingly, the decimating screams of “Ü”—“EEEEEEEEEEEE”—are the point of punk (it’s worth noting that Greil Marcus put “Ü” on his influential Lipstick Traces compilation). Kleenex collaborated with Rough Trade’s early go-to production duo of Geoff Travis and Red Krayola’s Mayo Thompson on the “Ü”\\/“You” single, perhaps owing to its audacious and wildly electric ensemble feel. “You” explodes with democratic purpose: “This is your life\\/This is your day\\/It’s all for you.” With that, the influence of Kleenex on a punk scene like Olympia’s from the 1980s onward is palpable; Kurt Cobain included “anything by Kleenex” on his list of favorite albums, but Bikini Kill’s “Liar” or Girlpool’s “Jane” are primary sources for the legacy of Kleenex screams today. “Split” is the perfect storm of Kleenex’s bottle-rocket inventiveness. The lyrics go, “Hotch-potch, hugger-mugger, bow-wow, hara-kiri, hoo-poo, huzza, hicc-up, hum-drum, hexa-pod, hell-cat, helter-skelter, hop-scotch.” This dizzied, scissor-cut, full-throttle collage is undercut with spirited declarations that, “Yesterday was a party! Yesterday the drinks were strong!” and a crude siren of “woo! woo! woo! woo!”s. There is nothing cerebral; there is only pure jubilance, only action. “Split” doesn’t sound “sung” as much as it sounds like it’s bolting out of someone’s chest. Play “Split” alongside anything off Never Mind the Bollocks and see which sounds more lawless; Kleenex make Sex Pistols sound like alt-rock.“We didn't have songs like ‘Fuck the System’ like other bands had,” Marder once said. “We didn’t throw stones and smash windows. We stood there and played songs.” But an autonomous message persisted. For several months in 1980, violent youth riots turned Zurich into a “war zone,” sparked by “a paucity of funding and space for the alternative arts scene.” Kleenex responded viscerally to this unwelcoming world by creating their own.In 2017, the rollercoaster ride of punk remains replete with adrenaline and adventure and thrills, with semblances of danger and truth. But rollercoasters have tracks and belts and guards; they are always the same. Kleenex built a rollercoaster with loose bolts, not at all predictable, bravely betraying structure, careening. At its best, punk offers up a self-immolating blueprint that says, year after year, “the blueprint is yet to be written.” Kleenex’s raw rapture still lights up this idea. First Songs is a testament to the freedom in limitation, or rather, the limitless nature of freedom when logic is tossed aside. \"],[22725,\"It is impossible to consider a given release by a footwork artist without confronting the long shadow cast by DJ Rashad’s catalog, particularly his magnum opus, Double Cup. The writing sessions for Double Cup started four years ago in San Francisco, after the producer Taso (Anastasios Ioannis Skalkos III) invited Rashad and DJ Spinn to the Bay Area. Taso appears four times on that album, and though it can be hard to discern an individual footwork producer’s idiosyncrasies, he leaves an indelible mark. He has a remarkable ability to smooth over the acidic edges that come with footwork’s inherent speed. This was especially true in the Double Cup’s introductory song “Feelin,” a revelatory musical moment that almost single handedly brought footwork to a larger audience. The three-man effort from Taso, Rashad, and Spinn was soulful and sensual, but also discombobulating in the way footwork often is. In other tracks like “Pass That Shit,” Taso helped break down the genre’s common barrier between dancefloor utility and home-listening. Overall, he was one of the architects of footwork mainstream jump, and he has returned with a solo effort, New Start, that extracts some of Double Cup’s best qualities.New Start opens much like Double Cup, with a collaboration between Taso, Rashad, and Spinn. On the album’s first song, “New Start,” there’s an immediate sense of warm familiarity. When these three producers worked together, they generated a sound that is both pulsating and comforting; perfect for both club speakers and paltry headphone listening. There was a pleasurable universality and malleability to the music they made together. On “AM Track,” the second of the trio’s collaborations on the album, they perfect the formula for smooth and soulful footwork found on Double Cup.Elsewhere, Taso works with other members of the Teklife crew, including DJ Earl, Gant-Man, Manny, and Taye. In all these collaborative works, he finds a way to locate and amplify the voice of another artist. For example, his track with Taye, “In the Green Room,” heightens Taye’s tendency towards a more hip-hop driven footwork by brightening it with elements of Miami bass. In “Da Capo Al Coda,” he is able to draw out the very best of Earl’s melancholic energy by slowing the beat way below 160 bpm, moving towards something closer to billowing ambient. Taso shows his individual voice just once on this album, in a track called “Murda Bass,” which surprisingly paints him a bit of a sentimentalist for vintage British dance music. He borrows freely from garage and UK bass, and it would be a stretch to call this track footwork. Here he showcases his versatility as a producer, able to accommodate and inhabit many styles at once.Oddly, some of the very best tracks on this album are in their own way slightly retrograde and stuck. They copy and fine-tune the aesthetic of Double Cup, and do little to break the mold. If anything, some of the most forward-thinking footwork of the moment is being made outside of Teklife (take for example Foodman’s intense experimentation). Still, New Start proves that the prowess of footwork’s first family is intact, and Taso might just be the glue that holds it all together.\"],[22722,\"In the pilot episode of “Insecure,” the critically lauded HBO comedy series created by Issa Rae and Larry Wilmore, Rae’s eponymous character Issa is at a crossroads. She’s in a stable but stale relationship, and the occasion of her 29th birthday has her wondering if she’s wasting time on a romance that’s heading nowhere. Issa decides to take her best friend Molly, who’s also feeling unlucky in love after a streak of failed flings, to an open mic night in hopes of setting her up with someone new—but secretly to reconnect with an ex-boyfriend. Before long, egged on by said ex, Issa winds up on the stage rapping about “Broken Pussy,” a term that she coined to explain Molly’s recent poor run of form (“Maybe it’s really rough, maybe it’s had enough.”)The resulting cheesy freestyle, set to the tune of Kelis’ twinkly 2006 hit “Bossy,” makes the cut as the second song on Insecure (Music From the HBO Original Series). Its placement injects a welcome dose of Issa’s personality (both fictional and real—Rae wrote the song with Wilmore) into the soundtrack, while acting as the skeleton key to understanding the rest of the selection; back on the small screen, “Broken Pussy” costs Molly the attention of a potential love interest and leads to a big fight between the two, but they reconcile easily by the end of the episode. The show “Insecure” excels at tracing the professional and affective tribulations of young black adults in L.A., but it stands apart for its depiction of the unbreakable black female friendship at the heart of the story. Insecure (Music from the HBO Original Series) celebrates this dynamic with 16 songs: mostly by or about women, almost exclusively by black artists. Arkansas-native Kari Faux kicks things off with “No Small Talk,” an anthem for the self-possessed, recorded previously for her 2014 EP Laugh Now, Die Later. A ringing phone blends in with a hard-hitting drum pattern to buoy Faux’s cool-but-confident delivery, replete with nods to Pimp C and 2 Chainz: “Three cellphones and I still don’t ever text ‘em\\/Catch me out in public and you know I’m flexin’.” Faux makes another appearance on “Top Down” assisted by Brooklyn MC Leikeli47, whose cadence recalls that of fellow New Yorker Amil. The song, a bouncy electropop composition about riding around in a drop top feeling like a million bucks, was commissioned for the first season finale.Much of the soundtrack appeared across “Insecure”’s 8 episodes to date, curated by the show’s eminent musical consultant Solange Knowles, who knows a thing or two about elucidating the black female experience on wax to dazzling effect. The feel-good anthems give way to songs that address a range of romantic entanglements. “Girl,” a standout track from the Internet’s 2015 album Ego Death, is expertly reimagined as an electric-guitar-driven ode to the feminine by SoCal ensemble 1500 or Nothin. Guordan Banks switches between the high and low register over a slick bassline on “Keep You in Mind,” a call for moving past the coy stages of flirtation onto something more serious.Although Faux’s “Top Down” is the only original song on Insecure, the rest were chosen carefully to illuminate the main characters’ tastes and animate the world that they inhabit, situated for the most part in predominantly black South L.A. neighborhoods like Leimert Park and Baldwin Hills. This is achieved by featuring either the work of local artists, like the 1500 or the Internet themselves (“Just Sayin\\/I Tried”), or songs that evoke a similar sense of place, like the sunny strings of “Palm Trees” by D.C. rapper GoldLink.Considered independently from the influences of the show, the “Insecure” soundtrack works as a seamless collection of hip-hop, soul and R&B. The list of performers runs the gamut from established artists like D’Angelo (“Sugah Daddy”) and Thundercat (“Heartbreaks + Setbacks”) to emerging talents like TT the Artist (“Lavish”) and Banks, who claimed his first Billboard #1 with “Keep You in Mind” last summer. In recent months, the well-timed placement of a song in a new TV series has taken on renewed importance as a means for new artists to raise their profile. “Insecure” was already renewed for a second season and while the protagonists’ fate is surely the highest priority for fans, a chance to devour the forthcoming score can’t be too far behind.\"],[22704,\"Rapper Simbi Ajikawo, who records as Little Simz, is by all measures on an upward trajectory, with comparisons to iconoclasts like Lauryn Hill and praise from craft-minded virtuosos like Kendrick Lamar (the latter said Simz “might be the illest doing it now.”) By last year’s A Curious Tale of Trials + Persons, she’d experienced enough fame to be ambivalent about it—“the type of music that ain’t never gonna sell,” she rapped on “Wings.” But sell it did, enough for Simz’s next album to feature notably well-curated guests (though not Lamar; that collaboration will probably be pretty great whenever it inevitably happens). All of which served to set her up nicely for her new album, which is…a concept album based on Alice in Wonderland.The reference to the children’s story is a metaphor, naturally—“It’s about situations I’m still trying to get my head around, and places where I’m still trying to figure out who to trust, or who not to trust,” Little Simz told Vice in late 2016. (The exact situations are a bit amorphous—in other interviews she’s suggested the music industry, or escaping into art, or escapism in general.) But the conceit is the biggest problem—there’s a limit to how many takes can be drawn from a book of Victorian math jokes and accompanying film of Disneyfied drugginess. Alice is also more suited to satire or farce—Carroll’s original idea—than serious subjects or earnest introspection, the two modes of this album. “LMPD,” the first track, features a conscious Chronixx verse on Bob Marley, Black Lives Matter, and pineal glands, followed by a birdsong-flecked interlude featuring a spacey, pitch-shifted Cheshire Cat that evokes, depending on how charitable one is, reggae or a spa. A point is being made here, but perhaps not the intended one.On Stillness in Wonderland, befitting the title, Simz eschews the vivid psychedelia of peers like Janelle Monáe in favor of a muted, atmospheric approach. There are a couple of overt references—a “white rabbit” clip recurs throughout, and “King of Hearts” takes advantage of Alice’s most confrontational character to let Simz take off heads with Chip (still atoning for his kiddie-grime past as Chipmunk) and Ghetts. But for the most part, the wonder is in the arrangements. Much of Stillness features gorgeous production; touchstones might be early Martina Topley-Bird or last year’s KING album.But Stillness in Wonderland comes off more as a sparsely edited mixtape than a self-contained album: heavy on atmosphere, light on songs. Simz is remarkably prolific—this is her 11th release—and the album often feels fragmentary: tracks have five ideas in the space where one should be, promising experiments are shoehorned into a concept that perhaps might not have been there. On “Picture Perfect,” she plays Wonderland MC over jaunty brass; if only there was more to say besides “Wonderland is amazing, ain’t it?” Unusually for such an introspective album, the guest spots are welcome respite.“Poison Ivy” is a standout, a duet with longterm collaborator Tilla about a toxic-yet-compelling relationship, personified in a distorted, prickly guitar line tried to build an alluring soul duet atop. On “Shotgun,” there’s a gossamer hook by the always-welcome Syd, and then there’s Bibi Bourelly’s Rihanna-polished swagger on “Bad to the Bone.” It’s probably not coincidental that these two tracks are both more polished, with a radio-pop sheen totally out of place with the proggier stuff, and contain relatively few Alice references; Simz’s grappling with fame may well be a holding pattern. “I don’t want to be an overnight sensation\\/I’m tryin’ to make a record you can’t stop playin’,” SiR says on “One in Rotation”; there’s some false dichotomy shit going on here, and then the track cuts off, abruptly, as if snapped out of a dream.\"],[22694,\"For the last thirty years, Israel’s electronic music scene has operated in fits and starts. When India opened up their borders to Israeli passports in 1988, many youths who had finished their conscription services poured into the country and became entranced by Goa trance, bringing that rave aesthetic back home with them. But by 1997, police cracked down on bigger festivals, driving electronic music further underground. The last few years have seen an uptick in hotly tipped young Israeli producers such as Moscoman, Autarkic, Deep’a & Biri, and Red Axes (not to mention Moscoman’s always intriguing Disco Halal imprint). Of them all, Yotam Avni might be best positioned to crossover to larger festival crowds, as his resumé links him with the likes of Derrick May, Osunlade, and Terrence Parker. Avni knows every side of the industry, beginning as a music journalist before moving to party promoter (AVADON) as well as his own club, Resek. Across a handful of singles, the Tel Aviv-based producer has mined the trenches between tech, tribal and deep house, his tracks popping up on both Ben Klock and Âme & Dixon’s Essential Mix. Following up on this summer’s “Monad XXII,” this four-track EP (also on the Berlin-based Stroboscopic Artefacts imprint) continues to push him towards a sound at that’s more assured, though he continues to take risks to varying degrees of success.“Orma” strikes a plangent, ominous chord and quickening hi-hat pattern for the techno. Just when it seems like it might just plunge deeper into darkness, Avni introduces a saxophone skronk and lets it echo. Quick fillips of tom and an incessant beep are added, but despite the horn and the possibilities it suggests, the track never quite moves beyond its original components. “Shtok” features glimmering struck bell tones not unlike Pantha du Prince, which Avni then sullies with sweeps of white noise and a phantasmal wordless vocal, just balancing between beauty and menace.“Even” mixes the EP’s stoutest beat with the most elegant filigree of strings –both plucked and bowed—and piano. For the title track, Avni builds a rhythm of rattling gourds and thumped wood, harkening back to his tribal house productions. Before it goes down that route though, a men’s chorus enters, making the “Tehillim” (or “psalms”) of the title a literal reference. The first few times through, the combination of choir and drums feels more like a throwback to Enigma. But Avni unleashes squalls of feedback and noise that give the track some grit, so that a mix of the ancient and futuristic also has a bit of the messy present in it.\"],[22714,\"Ambient music is a funny thing. As innocuous as it may seem on the surface, it can often be seen as an intrusion, an irritant. Muzak annoyed as many people as it mellowed, to the point where Ted Nugent tried to buy the company just to shutter it. When Brian Eno teamed with guitarist Robert Fripp (planting the seeds that would lead to his epochal Ambient series), the duo played a concert in Paris in May of 1975 that eschewed their Roxy Music and King Crimson fame and was subsequently met with catcalls, whistles, walkouts and a near-riot. Forty years later, Eno’s ambient works have drifted from misunderstood bane to canonical works. Eno’s long career has taken him from glam-rock demiurge to the upper stratospheres of stadium rock, from the gutters of no wave to the unclassifiable terrains of Another Green World, but every few years he gets pulled back into ambient’s creative orbit. And while last year’s entry The Ship suggested a new wrinkle, wherein Eno’s art songs inhabited and wandered the space of his ambient work like a viewer in an art gallery, Reflection retreats from that hybrid and more readily slots along works like the dreamlike Thursday Afternoon and 2012’s stately Lux.Like those aforementioned albums, Reflection is a generative piece. Eno approaches it less like an capital-A Artist, exerting his will and ego on the music, and more like a scientist conducting an experiment. He establishes a set of rules, puts a few variables into motion and then logs the results. Reflection opens with a brief melodic figure and slowly evolves from there over the course of one 54-minute piece. It’s not unlike the opening notes of Music for Airport’s “1\\/1,” with Robert Wyatt’s piano replaced by what might be a xylophone resonating from underwater. Each note acts like a pebble dropped into a pond, sending out ever widening ripples that slowly decay, but not before certain tones linger and swell until they more closely resemble drones. Listen closer and certain small frequencies emerge and flutter higher like down feathers in a draft.Around the 18-minute mark, one of those wafting frequencies increases in mass and the piece turns shrill for an instant before re-settling. Another brief blip occurs a half-hour in, like a siren on a distant horizon. Between these moments, the interplay of tones is sublime, reminiscent at times of famous jazz vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson’s weightless solos, time-stretched until they seem to be emanating from the moon rather than the earth. As smooth and unperturbed as Eno’s ambient pieces tend to be, these small events feel seismic in scale, even if they are short-lived. Scale becomes the operative word for Reflection. While the physical editions of the album last just under an hour, Eno conceived of the piece to be the most realized version of his ambient music yet, one without parameters or end. Around 51 minutes in, the music starts to slowly recede from our ears, gradually returning to silence. But there’s a version of the piece for Apple TV and iOS that presents a visual component as well as a sonic version of Reflection that’s ever-changing and endless. As the lengthy press release the accompanied the album noted: “This music would unfold differently all the time–‘like sitting by a river’: it’s always the same river, but it’s always changing.” In this instance, reviewing the actual album feels like taking measure of that river from a ship window; you can sense more changes occurring just beyond its borders. Eno’s ambient albums have never seemed utilitarian in the way of many other ambient and new age works, but naming the album Reflection indicates that he sees this as a functional release, in some manner. Eno himself calls it an album that “seems to create a psychological space that encourages internal conversation.” It feels the most pensive of his ambient works, darker than Thursday Afternoon. Playing it back while on holiday, it seemed to add a bit more gray clouds to otherwise sunny days. Maybe that’s just an aftereffect of looking back on the previous calendar year and perceiving a great amount of darkness, or else looking forward to 2017 and feeling full of dread at what’s still to come.  \"],[22724,\"There were innumerable cameos at the Bad Boy Family Reunion Tour, but as is often the case with nostalgia packages, “the inexorable march of time” stole the show. Shyne lip-synced “Bad Boyz” in exile from Belize. Lil’ Kim was as magnetic as ever, but tragically so, going blank during large portions of her past hits. While DMX and Ruff Ryders’ constant shirtlessness and bloody-knuckled Casio beats were a corrective to hip-hop’s sample-happy Shiny Suit era, with enough distance, they could all be lumped together as “late ’90s NYC rap.” And most bizarre of all were the once-estranged Lox screaming “if you glad that L-O-X is Ruff Ryders now!” during “Wild Out,” their first single after a nasty, public and possibly violent extrication from Bad Boy—referred to as “Rape'n U Records” on the subsequent We Are the Streets. Now signed to Roc Nation, the Lox are once again close to the locus of money, power and respect, affiliated with their third megastar-owned hip-hop conglomerate in as many albums. Their bizarre career is probably their biggest asset at this point and they have a hell of a story to tell. Filthy America...It’s Beautiful has little interest in telling it. No longer subject to the commercial expectations of their late-90s heyday, they should be able to talk directly to an audience for whom the first Lox album in nearly 17 years is “highly anticipated.” There’s enough time-stamped gossip in “What Else You Need to Know” to reward people who remember the narcissism of small differences fueling the D-Block and State Property beef and, yes, Sheek Louch utters the magic words “bring New York back.” More importantly, the voices and the wordplay of Styles P, Jadakiss, and Sheek have aged not one bit since 2000—no mean feat if you’ve tried to talk yourself into a recent Wu-Tang or DipSet project, or hell, just skip to Prodigy sounding like a wax figure of himself on “Hard Life.”Even within the narrow narrative structure on “What Else You Need to Know,” the chemistry between the trio is still a marvel. Jadakiss’ rasp remains one of hip-hop’s most indelible vocal instruments, a blank-faced menace even during the vast majority of Filthy America when he isn’t saying much of anything. Styles P’s wearied nihilism has naturally gotten more potent with age and as for Sheek...well, the bullish enthusiasm he shows for even his clumsiest rhymes is actually endearing at this point, providing an emotional immediacy to balance out his more reserved partners. He even knows he’s the third wheel—in fact, that’s exactly what he talks about on “What Else You Need to Know,” admitting he thought the “All About the Benjamins” beat was wack (they never had much of an ear for beats), weathering constructive criticism and chalking up his obvious exclusion from “Jenny from the Block” and “John Blaze” to knowing his role. You’d be hard pressed to find another example of a hardcore rapper taking an L with such dignity.All of this material would make for a fascinating interview on Hot 97, though it’s preceded by just that, the interminable “Stupid Questions” proving that the Lox are still the most tone deaf skit-makers in rap history. But because it’s a Lox track on a proper studio album, “What Else You Need to Know” is a reminder of the skill set separating great rappers from great songwriters. Like much of Filthy America, it’s saddled with an awkward hook and the kind of stainless steel, geographically non-specific, vaguely “futuristic” synth beats you typically hear from once commercially-viable rappers on the album after they’re no longer privy to A-list producers. Granted, Dame Grease and Pete Rock might be permanent A-listers to some, but their presence is only felt after reading the credits. And then there’s DJ Premier on the ironically titled “Move Forward.” If hearing Styles bitch about “mumbling rappers\\/DJs with the aux cord” still makes you want to pull irresponsible ATV tricks in celebration, it’ll be a pleasure to hear any Premo beat in 2016 because you know exactly what you’re getting. At the same time, you have to wonder what that’s worth when Premo’s 2016 output has been split between territorial flame-keepers like Royce 5'9 and remixes of Desiigner and Twenty One Pilots.The Lox are spared similar indignities here—Fetty Wap and Gucci Mane could churn out tracks like “The Agreement” and “Secure the Bag” ten times over in the span of a month and their appearances show the Lox have an interest in contemporary rappers without chasing contemporary trends. But maligned as they were for playing dress-up with both Bad Boy and Ruff Ryders—too grimy for the former, too conventional for the avant-Tunnel Banger phase of the latter—their commercial ambitions were the solution, not the problem. The Lox’s most beloved songs—“Money, Power and Respect,” “Wild Out,” “We Gonna Make It,” “Good Times”— provided state-of-the-art beats, ready-made hooks, and most importantly, direction for a group whose artistic zenith is probably a collection of radio freestyles.Otherwise, despite no longer being required to stuff a $17.99 compact disc to capacity, the Lox still have a way of making at least half of Filthy America feel like filler. They’re far more interesting characters than they let on: Styles P wrote a novel on his Blackberry and also opened a juice bar with Jadakiss. Surely the ins and outs of franchising would make for more interesting material than the “concept tracks” or production choices here, all of which seem designed to recall 1999 —“Hard Life” is Dame Grease blatantly Xeroxing “It’s Mine”; “Move Forward” is “Recognize Pt. II,” while “The Family,” “The Omen,” and the courtroom procedural “Filthy America” have precedents that can be easily identified by even casual rap consumers from the late ‘90s. But while both Styles and Jadakiss are capable of coming up with a scene-stealing guest verse or two every year—see: Schoolboy Q’s “Groovy Tony\\/Eddie Kane,” the “Ooouuu” remix—they know damn well that’s what keeps their career going at this point and they know better than to waste their best material here. The Lox have never lived up to their potential and they certainly aren’t going to start now.\"],[22715,\"Lots of drone musicians have been called sound sculptors, but Harry Bertoia literally was one. The Italian-born American artist, who passed away in 1978 at age 63, remains well-known today as a sculptor and designer. In the last decade of his life, though, he also became a musician, pretty much by chance. While building large metal sculptures—mostly collections of tall rods standing upright on square bases—he discovered that they generated long, rich tones when struck. Enthralled by these sounds, he remodeled a barn in rural Pennsylvania to house over 90 of the pieces and began obsessively playing and recording them. A series of 11 privately-pressed LPs—released on Bertoia’s own Sonambient label—became highly sought-after among experimental music aficionados.Last year, John Brien of Massachusetts label Important Records collected all of Bertoia’s albums in a CD box set, and began combing through the unreleased recordings that Bertoia left behind. In keeping with the format of the original LPs, Brien’s first release on the relaunched Sonambient label, Clear Sounds\\/Perfetta, is titled after single, uninterrupted tracks that appear on each side. And just like the very first Bertoia LP—1970’s Bellissima Bellissima Bellissima \\/ Nova—this new record features a performance by Harry Bertoia on Side A and one by his brother Oreste (who assisted Harry in much of his playing and recording) on Side B.The legend of the original Sonambient albums looms so large in sound-art circles that choosing their successor comes with some pressure. But Brien was up to the task, as Clear Sounds\\/Perfetta holds up well next to Bertoia’s previous releases, sharing their unique combination of tactile realism and otherworldly abstraction. Often the clanging and crashing of the metal is so tangible you can practically see Bertoia’s sculptures swaying and vibrating. But just as frequently, his massive sounds feel utterly removed from time and space—alien tones that have no real parallel in any music generated by conventional instruments.Bertoia’s work reaches a frightening pitch in “Clear Sounds,” a recording he made in June of 1973. Amid a wealth of high-end ringing, sounds emerge that could be repurposed for a horror film, including buzzsaw-like noise mirrored by cavernous echoes and distant gong-like rumbles. There is a terrifying moment at the 12-minute mark that must be the disembodied cries of tortured ghosts. Yet “Clear Sounds” is also imbued with a calm, meditative tone, which persists even through the piece’s loudest, most skin-raising stretches.Recorded in June of 1971, Oreste Bertoia’s contribution, “Perfetta,” is not as immediately striking or oddly intriguing as “Clear Sounds.” But Oreste’s style is busier and more tonally varied, and there’s much to be hypnotized by in his rippling static and quiet-to-loud drones. Whether you actually are hypnotized by this music or simply find it a neat sonic curiosity seems on the surface like an either\\/or question. But one of the attractions in Harry Bertoia’s work—and perhaps what makes it still sound so alive 40 years later—is that it's simultaneously a creative marvel and a captivating experience. Clear Sounds\\/Perfetta continues and extends that multi-layered effect, while stoking the fires of anticipation for what’s still to come from Bertoia’s archives.\"],[22745,\"On 2006’s “That’s Life,” Killer Mike boasted “You’d be hard-pressed to find another rapper smart as me,” opening up about Cornel West and Michael Eric Dyson, poverty, respectability politics, and civil rights, before taking on both Bush Administrations (“George Bush don’t like blacks … and his daddy CIA had flooded the hood with rock”). A few months later, El-P was waging war with the same enemy in the 9\\/11 conspiracy theory thriller “Run the Numbers,” concluding that “it always comes back to a Bush.” The two songs sounded very little alike, but the music (and the rappers) shared a similar fire and presence: confident, conspiratorial, no-holds-barred, and razor-sharp. Neither were likely to be deemed “political” rappers then, but both were already dissenters and nonconformists; independent artists signed to themselves, free thinkers shooting off at the mouth. Nearly a decade after airing out the Bush family, the duo, as Run the Jewels, have found a creative renaissance. The group’s latest self-titled album, Run the Jewels 3, is a well timed, finely tuned rap epic that confronts the ruling class (here addressed as “the masters”) with deadly precision; it’s rap as resistance.With a demagogue waiting in the wings to assume the presidency, their particular Molotov mix of explosive shit-talking and unfiltered insubordination feels vital.Their interplay is instinctual this time around; the songs move and shuffle with its MCs intuitively trading bars, filling the gaps in each others’ phrases, and feeding off each others’ energies, using their booming voices to cut through the startling noises of a future dystopia. “Poor folk love us the rich hate our faces\\/We talk too loud, won't remain in our places,” El-P raps on “Everybody Stay Calm.” They’re both observers who refuse to sugarcoat. “I just try my best, man, to say something about the shit I see,” Killer Mike told The New Republic in 2015. “Because I don’t want to go crazy. I don’t want to be walking around angry and feeling rage.” To that end, RTJ3 isn’t a response or reaction, it’s a preemptive strike, laying the groundwork for the battleground ahead. Their methods remain consistent, but the stakes have been raised over the years. RTJ1 was a fun experiment; RTJ2 was a classicist statement, and now RTJ3 is a reckoning. Many of these songs have more urgency than before; If RTJ2 was the music of protest, then this is the music of revolt. In that way, RTJ3 is essentially the Run the Jewels manifesto, an outpouring of rage and defiance that is never overcome by the moment and never loses sight of the objectives: rallying the troops, holding everyone accountable (from lawmakers, to other rappers, to Don Lemon and themselves), and toppling oppression wherever it may reign (on “Thieves! (Screamed the Ghost),” El-P raps, “Fear’s been law for so long rage feels like therapy”). “Thursday in the Danger Room” peers into the duo's personal turmoil and their shared history, and on “2100” Killer Mike lays out their President-Trump survival strategy: “You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope.” The key to RTJ3 is closer “A Report to the Shareholders,” which is plainspoken about the duo’s message and intent: “Maybe that’s why me and Mike get along \\/ Not from the same part of town, but we both hear the same sound coming \\/ And it sounds like war.” Seconds later, Killer Mike goes full Malcolm X: “Choose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon’ win \\/ It could all be over tomorrow, kill our masters and start again.” This is the ire of a group that’s tired of saying I told you so.This is by far the best produced record of their trilogy, with beats that find new and interesting ways to wreak havoc. “Call Ticketron” turns automated ticketing technology into a beacon for alien transmissions. On “Hey Kids (Bumaye)” crackling static and thumping bass crater open to reveal whirring, wobbling tones and ghostly whispers, and Danny Brown slots in an exceptional guest verse. On “Panther Like a Panther (Miracle Mix),” furnished by the shouts of Miami rap goddess Trina, rounded blips mimic the patter of hand drums before bursting into a wave of buzzing, distorted noise that slowly dissipates back into nothing. They’re still clearly having fun doing this and it’s still fun to listen to them work.It isn’t quite as punchy as RTJ2, which was brutish in its tactics, with nonstop bangs and thrills, but RTJ3 is a triumph in its own right that somehow celebrates the success of a seemingly unlikely friendship and mourns the collapse of a nation all at once. “Thieves! (Screamed the Ghost),” a song about riots as a response to violence as opposed to a means to create it, samples an iconic Martin Luther King, Jr. quote from the 1967 speech “The Other America”: “A riot is the language of the unheard.” In keeping with that idea, RTJ3 is a soundtrack for the riots to come.\"],[22700,\"“Why so sad?\\/Don’t feel so bad\\/Get out of bed,” Steven Warwick tunelessly sings over gutted synths and a plodding drum machine on “Get It Together,” the bleak ode to something resembling self-care that introduces Nadir. This half-hearted plea offers quite the starting point: climbing, out of absolute necessity and with little fanfare, from a very low place. The UK-born, Berlin-based Warwick has performed with Luke Younger (aka Helm) in the duo Birds of Delay and, more recently, solo as Heatsick; his output under that moniker offered wry, danceable commentary on the niche social realities of the creative class. This mixtape-like offering is his fourth full-length with PAN, but his first under his own name, and marks a shift away from sardonic needling into something that’s more acutely—and personally—an artifact of total precarity. Balancing a fatigued observational poetics with ambient synth sketches, Nadir strings together a series of uncomfortably crisp images of a parched present.As Heatsick, Warwick composed and performed using a beat-up Casio keyboard and a drum machine. While his productions weren’t exactly rich in sound, they tended to reach beyond those limited means, deploying skittering rhythms and juxtaposing textures to complex effect. Here, he gives up on this resourceful streak and embraces austerity. Sounds are bluntly placed, without much in the way of effects to dull their sharp corners: A harsh synth patch on “CTFO” maintains a single, flat volume throughout, running head-on into Warwick’s passive baritone. “Low Ceiling” matches a grating beat with the sound of helicopters overhead: “I feel scared\\/So I took a pill\\/And it calms me down,” he narrates. More ambient-minded offerings like “Racetrack Playa” and “Canyon Shadow” rumble aimlessly, streaked with staticky, trembling synthesizers. These still stretches are among the most evocative moments on the release, like the wordless reprieve of looking out a window while you’re in transit.This threadbare aesthetic is propelled by Warwick’s writing. His accounts of panic attacks or souring relationships are indistinctly one-size-fits-most, if occasionally a little repugnant in their sheer passivity. But his descriptions of place are particularly lucid, as on “The Mezzanine,” in which he looks into a new urban shopping plaza: “There’s a zone of near serenity,” he says. “Sometimes you catch the gaze of a passing onlooker. You scan the purchases of an innocent bystander. The mezzanine is your dance floor. It’s your chessboard.”A visual component to the album exists on Dutch artist Harm van den Dorpel’s delinear.info platform, comprising a nonlinear sequence of lyrics, cellphone videos, and photographs taken by Warwick between Berlin, Los Angeles, and New York, the three locations where Nadir was recorded. This colors in the transient spatial logic and general sense of dislocation that permeate these songs: an image of a desert sunset or a touching abstract photo of a beach at low tide will be layered with an iPhone picture taken in a shopping center or a German fast-food restaurant.Though it can be beautiful in a stark, sad way, there is little comforting in Nadir’s millennial abjection. Many of the most effective recent attempts to process our troubled socio-political moment in sound have presented some form of escape, or at least catharsis. But these compositions contain neither, and don’t attempt to synthesize a broader narrative. They function instead—like the images Warwick has assembled to accompany them—as snapshot-documents of impermanent locations, of experiences that don’t quite add up, of the bizarre conditions of urban life in 2016. The uneven emotional and social landscapes Warwick conjures feel honest, and woefully relatable, in their inability to resolve.\"],[22720,\"In January 2016, rapper\\/actor Yasiin Bey announced his departure from entertainment. “I’m retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today—and also from Hollywood, effective immediately,” the artist proclaimed. “I’m releasing my final album this year, and that’s that.” In the 10-minute clip, posted to Kanye West’s personal website, Bey—formerly known as Mos Def—sounded weary, yet resolute. He was being detained in South Africa after trying to leave the country on a World Passport. Bey had been living in Cape Town since 2013, seemingly content with a low-key existence away from the spotlight.Over the years, the rapper has been responsible for some of underground hip-hop's most resonant music. 1998’s Mos Def and Talib Kweli Are Black Star, with friend and fellow Brooklyn lyricist Talib Kweli, is a widely heralded classic, and a year later Bey released Black on Both Sides, a remarkably nuanced LP full of introspective soul. Bey’s sophomore album—The New Danger, released five years later to the day in 2004—marked a drastic shift from the relaxed aura of his first record. With beats by producer Minnesota and contributions from his rock band, Black Jack Johnson, Bey opted for an edgy rock sound that occasionally missed the mark. But if nothing else, at least he sounded inspired, like he actually gave a shit about the art he’s releasing. After 2006’s True Magic, another dud released to fulfill Bey’s contract at Geffen Records, he rebounded on 2009’s The Ecstatic, a flurry of repurposed beats by Stones Throw affiliates.December 99th, Bey’s new album with producer Ferrari Sheppard, is by far the worst thing he’s ever released. I’m not just talking music; I mean this is the saddest thing—album, commercial, or film—with which Bey’s been associated. There’s nothing even remotely redeeming here, and it makes me wonder how long the rapper was awake before he wrote and recorded this material. For its 31 minutes, Bey sleepwalks through every track, mumbling nonsensical flows that never connect at all. And when he’s not doing that, he whistles through these instrumentals—like a poor man’s Negan here to terrorize Rick Grimes. Instead of a finished project, December 99th feels like a demo that listeners should never hear. These are the lines you fumble through while you think of better lines to write. On “Local Time,” the message is noble enough, but the rapper’s lethargic drone makes it tough to digest for a discernible extent: “We experience tests today\\/Above all, we are blessed today\\/Same as every day\\/In a special way.” Bey built his career on these sorts of affirmations, but they land with a thud on December 99th. It’s as if the rapper no longer believes his own words, or he’s tired of hearing himself say them.The only bright spots come from Sheppard’s soundtrack, but even those are few. “Tall Sleeves” boasts dark, smoldering synths that emit a sultry vibe. Tracks “Special Dedication” and “Heri” feel lush and aerated, giving Bey evocative canvases on which to create. But for the remainder, especially on “Blade in the Pocket,” “Seaside Panic Room” and “Shadow in the Dark,” the music sounds underdeveloped, exposing Bey's disengaged, flat mumbling in the harshest possible light. While Bey and Sheppard share the blame for this debacle, December 99th is ultimately a bigger strike against the rapper’s legacy. For an artist who once uplifted the masses, it seems he needs someone to do the same for him. Maybe he’s leaving at the right time.\"],[22699,\"Don’t take your eyes off Pete Rock. The early-‘90s albums he produced with rapper CL Smooth still live in legend; recent reports suggest the New York duo are reuniting for their first new music since Nas dropped Illmatic. This pair, like their contemporaries A Tribe Called Quest, weren’t about to go back into the studio just because fans wanted them to. Rock may be the golden-age god whose snap-n-crack boom bap helped spawn J Dilla, Mark Ronson, and Kanye West, but take a look at the names that make up Rock’s recent client list—Torae, Grafh, Snyp Life—and it’s clear that he’s less interested in collecting checks than he is crowding his orbit with hard-nosed hip-hop.On Don’t Smoke Rock—Rock’s first full-length collaboration since 2011’s Monumental with Smif-N-Wessun—his anointed partner is Smoke DZA. Their album plays like a wintertime drive through Harlem in a Bentley with black-tinted windows, and they swerve together with pure confidence. It especially suits DZA; a prolific working MC with blunted flow and to-the-point storytelling skills, he has struggled to distinguish himself in the crowded world of NYC street rap revivalists. Though he might not possess the crackling lyrical loops of Action Bronson, the bitter wordplay of Ka, or the flashy sheen of brothers Westside Gunn and Conway, the Harlemite’s throwback cadences are a solid foil for the uptown cool of Rock’s crisp soul samples and tough drums.On “Wild 100s,” the producer takes the kind of double bass that Brian Wilson once harnessed in his pop symphonies, and he compresses them into a tense, energetic rap beat. “Hold the Drums” deletes all percussion; Rock instead fills the soundscapes with an angelic piano and voice sample on top of some skilled record scratches, as DZA wistfully nods to the past (“Mama had me rockin’ bucket hats when I was a year old”). His boasts can sound off-the-shelf (“Hop on a joint with me, it’s manslaughter,” he spits on “Wild 100s”), but his flow has charm and anchors Rock’s instrumentals. “Show Off” is the kind of New York anthem Jay Z sketched out on The Blueprint, and the peppy horns of “Dusk 2 Dusk” reimagines uptown as an off-the-billboard utopia.The project is bolstered by some well-deployed guest spots, too. Cam’ron delivers one of his strongest verses in years on the drug tale “Moving Weight Pt. I,” a scene straight out of a David Simon TV drama. Spotting cops on the corner, Cam considers the possibility he may need to blast his way out of trouble. He feels for his pistol and rubs the bulletproof vest under his cardigan, pausing to deliver some tongue-twisting surrealism (“Bad bitches in the tub, tell ‘em they all luck-ay\\/Grab me a condom, gave her the rubber duck-ay”). Rick Ross seems an unlikely pick for Rock’s natty stylings, but his husky voice isn’t its usual wrecking ball on the opulent strings of “Black Superhero Car.” And while Jadakiss and Styles P have a spotty history on other people’s tracks, they’re effective on the bitter ballad “Milestone,” slipping into the role of two salty veterans sadly surveying the past.This year, Tribe made an album that was grandiose, politically engaged, haunted by loss, and one of the year’s finest. But Pete Rock and Smoke DZA have forged something we still need, too: a great, modest New York rap album of concrete beats and blood-in-your-mouth bars. We await the reunion with CL Smooth with interest.\"],[22665,\"Soul Jazz’s Punk 45 series has made it its mission to chart the forgotten corners of punk rock, one seven-inch record at a time, training its magnifying glass on the obscure groups or regional scenes that familiar histories overlook. In particular, its more localized iterations suggest that how punk sounded depended very much on where its seeds fell. A Los Angeles installment turned up the decadent nihilism of the Germs and the snotty proto-hardcore of the Middle Class, while last year’s Akron, Ohio disc focused on the likes of Devo and the Rubber City Rebels, freak prophets of a curdled futurism that echoed industrial America’s decline. Now, Les Punks takes Punk 45 back across the Atlantic to chart what happened when punk landed in mainland Europe.Punk rock was born in New York and London, but France provided much of the genre’s intellectual and aesthetic grounding. Les Punks’ sleeve notes trace punk’s currents back to a number of sources in France’s rich countercultural history: to writers like Rimbaud and Voltaire, the vanguard art movements of Dada and surrealism, the erotic provocations of Serge Gainsbourg, and the leftist sedition of chief Situationist Guy Debord, whose Society of the Spectacle provided intellectual ballast for the student riots of 1968, and from there found its way to the Sex Pistols via manager Malcolm McLaren and designer Jamie Reid. Unquestionably too, the French have always had an ear for the cool shit. Les Punks also spotlights the role of figures like Paris-based Marc Zermati, whose label Skydog fostered early links with New York and London scenes, and even released a seminal punk-before-punk document in the shape of Iggy and the Stooges’ chaotic live album Metallic KO.But in 1976, France had no pioneering rock‘n’roll tradition of its own, and a fair bit of Les Punks veers towards the imitative. The French groups clearly adored the dandyish side of New York punk—and man, did they dig Iggy. Angel Face’s “Wolf City Blues” is pure Stooges yowl and growl, with lashings of Ron Asheton-style wah-wah, while Fantomes’ cover of “I Wanna Be Your Dog” is too straight—a slavish, puppy-dog take on the original rather than a rabid leg-humper in its own right. Meanwhile, Dogs’ “Here Comes My Baby” and a couple of singles by Marie Et Les Garçons ably channel the more rocking NYC groups—the New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, the Modern Lovers—with lots of enthusiasm but not much in the way of innovation.Elsewhere, though, there’s evidence of young French groups carving out a distinctive local sound. Perhaps the quintessential French punk group is Métal Urbain, who made the bold move of swapping out live bass and drums for a synthesizer and drum machine. 1977’s “Paris Maquis” —which holds the honor of being the very first single ever to be released on Rough Trade Records—is a blast of caustic guitar and teeth-grinding rhythm box clatter that set a blueprint for future synth-punk groups (notably, Steve Albini’s Big Black). Unlike many of their peers, Métal Urbain sang in French—“So the Americans can’t understand us,” they told Search and Destroy in 1977. But even without much of a grasp of the language, you can get the gist of “Paris Maquis,” a tribute to the French Resistance fighters of World War 2: “La ville resiste terroriste… Fasciste!” Indeed, there’s an argument to be made that French punk was post-punk at its inception—modish, intellectual, already finding ways to rewire punk’s familiar formulas. Charles De Goal, the solo project of one Patrick Blaine, contributes “Dance Le Labyrinthe,” an early example of the emergent cold wave sound powered by clip-clopping drum machines, spasms of electronic noise and vocals pitched at the brink of hysteria. “Mind,” by Nancy duo KaS Product, is turbulent electro-punk with a bravura performance from vocalist Mona Soyoc. Its take on mental instability and stifling social conformity may have been inspired by synth player Spatsz’s day job as a psychiatric nurse. And there’s a curiosity in the shape of the torrid, sexual “Sally,” by Gazoline—a band fronted by one Alain Kan, an androgynous, outwardly queer artist and addict who performed alongside Gainsbourg at the Alcazar Club before turning to punk rock. An enigma, he was last seen in 1990, taking a ride on the Paris Metro. His fate is unknown.It’s worth giving another shout to Les Punks’ sleeve notes, a fat 50 pages of essays and interviews that supply precious context, plus extensive illustration from Bazooka—a “graphic commando” cell of radical French illustrators who, if you believe the rumors, boasted ties to the Baader-Meinhof gang. Track for track, there are compilations that cover French punk and post-punk with a better hit rate. The two volumes of Born Bad’s Des Jeunes Gens Mödernes lean further into the France’s homegrown coldwave and synthwave sound, and are better for it. But a snapshot of French punk’s first flush, Les Punks stands up. It’s the sort of time capsule that’s not quite ready to become a museum piece: loud and arrogant and ready to create a spectacle.\"],[22666,\"It’s safe to say there is no other band on the planet quite like Senyawa. What do you call the music of this Indonesian duo: folk? Doom metal? Unplugged minimalist noise improv? In fact, it is a little bit of each. Wukir Suryadi plays the bambuwukir, an instrument of his own design—an amplified zither, fashioned out of bamboo, that looks like it could double as a weapon. It does the work of many instruments, and from it he ekes bowed string passages, plucked and strummed guitar-like sounds, and even woody, percussive rhythms. He has long hair and an intense mien, and onstage, he looks like a metal guitarist coaxing spirits from an alien relic rescued from a shipwreck.As for Rully Shabara—how best to describe what Shabara does? You couldn’t call him a “singer,” exactly. He never simply sings. He incarnates the fleshy essence of the human voice: He shrieks, he ululates, he jibbers. Sometimes, he dips down to a low, throaty growl, its texture as pronounced as the clicking of a dial; in his falsetto range, he is a bird of prey honing in on a small mammal. He lies somewhere on a spectrum connecting Diamanda Galás and Mayhem’s Attila Csihar.Brønshøj (Puncak), the follow-up to last year’s Menjadi, is darker and more abstracted than that album. In place of melody or rhythm, see-sawing drones and scraped textures predominate. The record is the product of an intense session held in a basement studio in Copenhagen’s working-class Brønshøj neighborhood. The duo would agree on themes—cues like “old shed,” “McDonald’s,” or “forest,” although none are necessarily discernible from the music itself—and then commence playing. Suryadi ran his bambuwukir through a short chain of cheap guitar pedals, including a looping device; Shabara used an old-school Shure 55SH Series II—the “Elvis microphone”—and the mixer’s built-in reverb and echo effects. For two days, the duo jammed, cooked Indonesian food in the kitchen next to the studio, smoked, and jammed some more. Beyond the vinyl master, there was no post-production. The album’s five songs reflect their genesis: They are slow, drawn out, and meditative, and they admit little daylight. (“Puncak” means “summit” in Indonesian, but the music feels more like a series of plateaus than peaks.) “Brønshøj 1”—all five of the album’s tracks bear simple, sequential titles—is a kind of invocation. In an approximation of Tibetan throat singing, Shabara explores the lowest, gravelliest reaches of his voice, as though caressing his larynx with a scouring pad, while Suryadi bows funereal drones. It sounds a lot like an acoustic cousin of Sunn O)))’s blackened doom, and the closing “Brønshøj 5” continues in a similar vein, applying fuzz-pedal distortion to Suryadi’s guitar-like leads as Shabara paces in slow, teasing circles around the root note. Continuing in the avant-metal vein, the short “Brønshøj 3” takes a few strands of similar material and simply runs the tape in reverse; it wouldn't sound out of place as an interstitial sketch on a Blut Aus Nord album.In its pursuit of a singular mood, the record is slightly less dynamic than Menjadi or the duo’s self-titled 2010 album, but the album’s two longest tracks offer a fuller indication of the duo’s range. On “Brønshøj 2,” Suryadi loops a glowering pedal tone and twists the tuning peg on a second string as he plucks it, creating an eerie, undulating effect; Shabara largely hangs back, laying down a smoky backdrop behind Suryadi’s high-necked riffing, which suggests the liquid glint of lap steel. “Brønshøj 4” combines bowed melodic phrases with a looped rhythm reminiscent of thumb piano; it is the album’s lightest track, melancholy yet also comforting. Toward the climax of its 11-minute run, as silvery string loops begin to burn white-hot, Shabara finally lets loose with a succession of inhuman shrieks and growls, lightly augmented by delay. He sounds like a synthesizer; he sounds like a pterodactyl. Yet, despite the obvious, formidable power of his voice, he never feels the need to fully unleash it; he sticks to the sidelines, directing his voice away from the listener. It reminds me of something Shabara did when the duo played Krakow’s Unsound festival this fall. At the end of a song, he stepped away from the microphone and unleashed a brief operatic run, which went soaring over our heads. Even unamplified, he dominated the cavernous hall. This short, intimate album functions in similar ways. Rather than attempting to bowl you over, Brønshøj instead invites you to lean in closer, and rewards handsomely when you do. \"],[22719,\"When Chance the Rapper performed “Sunday Candy” with Jamila Woods and Nico Segal at the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, there was something distinctly special, and spiritual, about it: A prodigious and cheery “mixtape rapper” singing modern psalms and praises on the national stage at the behest of the first black President of the United States in his last days; the convergence of a God Dream and the American Dream. It felt like something to soak in and savor, to get nourishment from—both because of its almost absurdly uplifting energy and because it was something we might never see again, on any count. Chance seemed to linger in the moment, as if recognizing and relishing its significance; for many, next Christmas will feel much different, and this ceremony will probably look different, too. Next Christmas will be a white Christmas.The sentiment echoed weeks later on “Saturday Night Live” when Chance and Kenan Thompson performed a sketch called “Jingle Barack,” its politics laid plain in its lyrics: “It’s the last Christmas with Barack still here,” the foreshadowing clear, the successor’s agenda unspoken. Both Chicago natives, Chance first met Obama when he was 8 years old, his father a staffer for the POTUS during his Senate years. It isn’t too much of a stretch to suggest that Chance’s songs can often embody the hope Obama campaigned on—sources of inspiration for those coloring outside the lines, and also, to paraphrase Kanye, those who are colored and deemed out of line. Perhaps it’s only a coincidence that Chance is coming into his own as a lightning rod and leader as Obama departs, but it isn’t a coincidence that he identified this Christmas as a necessary time for healing.As if realizing the magnitude of the moment, or just never one to miss an opportunity to be merry, Chance and fellow Chicagoan Jeremih surprise released a holiday marvel called Merry Christmas Lil’ Mama, a Christmas album for the final yuletide of the Obama administration: one last bastion of hope in an uncertain and fraught time; a sonic snow globe where unflinching altruism, glee, and love (both neighborly and sensual) rule; a priceless gift celebrating the season of giving.And it isn’t just for President Obama—or for Lil’ Mama—it’s for all of us, too. It’s functional Christmas music that’s somehow also music for any function, set at Christmas. Where holiday tunes are typically hokey, decidedly old-fashioned, and predictable, Merry Christmas Lil’ Mama is actively (and perhaps instinctively) animated and stimulating, not satisfied with just conveying the spirit of the season but breathing life into it; it’s warm, natural, and even familiar in spots. This is the rare Christmas album that breaks from convention without defying tradition, using A Christmas Story snippets, a “Carol of the Bells” rework, and an “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” interpolation as blueprints to create the most refreshing festive songs in recent memory. But more than anything, it’s frolicsome and jolly, in keeping with the theme. The album captures Christmastime joy with juke, and jive, and the Jackson 5. About three minutes in, Hannibal Buress asks for Travis Scott effects on his vocals, and he gets them. There’s something for everyone.Over nine songs that sound like they were as fun to make as they are to listen to, Chance and Jeremih move in intervals and in tandem, complementing each other and operating in sync without losing their distinct voices. Chance’s path is mostly a righteous one (“The Pontius Pilates judge my bundle of joys\\/I know my bronze is gorgeous\\/Know who the birthday boy is”), and Jeremih’s a naughty one (“Know you cold, let’s bundle up\\/I’m just tryna get some love”), but they frequently find the overlaps or trade roles, as on “Snowed In” and “Joy.” In Jeremih’s capable hands, holiday staples become innuendos: sleighs and slays, hos, silent nights and unwrappings, sliding down chimneys, etc. Chance can turn a club into a nativity scene. Together they are an unstoppable force of good will and glad tidings wrapped in radiant melodies and scat raps. Merry Christmas Lil’ Mama scans Chance’s acid rap, steppers R&B, robotic soul, the gospel lite of Coloring Book, and Teklife juke and footwork seamlessly, adding streaking string arrangements, distorted Auto-Tune vocals, choirs, standout Zaytoven keyboard fills, and production from DJs Spinn and Gantman. They enlists help from rappers Lud Foe, King Louie, and Noname (who delivers another show-stopping verse on “The Tragedy” with raps like “Our heathenous appetite, ever and after\\/Like Christmas will save us and bathe us in rapture”). The songs are sincere and unpretentious, and are encapsulated by a single Jeremih lyric: “Your presence is a present for me\\/For Christmas or just because.”The album crescendos into “I Shoulda Left You,” a lively anthem for anyone looking to ditch toxicity in the godforsaken year that was 2016. “Rest in peace to great David Bowie\\/Please can we get back Prince?” Chance pleads in a half whine before beaming brightly, stifling laughter; there’s still fun to be had. The song serves as a larger metaphor for progress and optimism, avoiding stagnation, and cutting off unhealthy relationships. Its cheer feeds its mentality, seemingly suggesting better days ahead. A few minutes earlier, on “Joy,” Jeremih insinuates that we must create that brighter future ourselves. “They tend to forget about love,” he sings. “Let’s get right back to the joy.” And in these moments, where everything is snug and safe, it seems possible—probable even. On Merry Christmas Lil’ Mama, Christmas is restorative. No matter what, hope endures.\"],[22667,\"It’s not easy for drummers to get the spotlight, especially if they’re the non-singing kind—no matter how prodigiously talented they may be. For every Ahmir “Questlove” Johnson (the Roots) or Damon Che (Don Caballero), there are hundreds of anonymous men and women who pound the back beat while their bandmates take center stage. After years of playing back-up to others, including many in the Leaving and Brainfeeder label nexuses (and, curiously, accompanying Wordpress founder Matthew Mullenweg in his senior recital as a jazz major), drummer Jamire William’ establishes his voice on solo debut \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual, a surprisingly satisfying record composed almost entirely of his own drumming.\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual isn’t the first time Williams has put himself out front. Previously he lead the jazz\\/hiphop\\/rock band ERiMAJ, who released one more or less overlooked record in 2012; though he was a principal songwriter, he was also just a member and not the group’s singer. But on \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual, Williams strips away the instruments and melodies, leaving behind only his percussion, both live and looped, all the while posing a direct question about what exactly classifies as a “song.”Williams adorns a handful of his tracks with melodic accoutrements but ten of \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual’s fifteen cuts are just in-your-face drum hits. \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual begins with a sharp, two-handed snare snap on “WHO WILL STAND?” that summons the aforementioned Questlove and his opening to the Root’s “The Seed (2.0).” The similarity is striking, but Williams’ version is a stoned, hazily recorded drummer-on-his-own practice session that gives way to open space instead of a tight rhythm and blues. It’s remarkable how such a short snippet of sound can leave such an imprint, but it sets the stage for \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual in an odd and effective way.What most distinguishes Williams’ tracks is a strangely hypnotic and claustrophobic quality , made more striking by the fuzzy recording quality. The fluid compositions sometimes evoke classic solo performances like Max Roach’s “The Drum Also Waltzes” or Tony Williams’ “Echo” stretched out and explored. “Selectric,” with its thudding, dystopic programmed drums, sounds like 21st-century version of Billy Cobham’s “Anxiety,” while the uncharacteristically tight “[ Selah ]”—featuring extra percussion by producer Carlos Niño—gives “Funky Drummer” a run for its money.An even better reference point for \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual might be Antonio Sanchez’s magnificent 2014 soundtrack to the film Birdman. There, drums were similarly arranged around musique concrete samples, conjuring an entrancing, insular world that can simultaneously propel or make crazy anyone who dares listen for too long. The skittering pitter-patter of the hi hat on “Illuminations” mirrors Sanchez’s “Almost Human,” and the slow snare brushes of “wash me over (Pollock’s Pulse)” could just have easily been swapped into Birdman with the subtitle “(Keaton’s pulse).” Yet despite the success of Williams’ solo performances, the album’s numbers featuring additional instrumentation (from other musicians) are without doubt the album’s most listenable. GB (aka Gifted & Blessed) contributes to three of them, the most compelling of which is “TRUTH REMAINS CONSTANT,” which marries an anxious tom thump and cymbal crash rhythm with an airy Oberheim synthesizer. The result recalls pastoral bedroom IDM like Boards of Canada’s “Everything You Do is a Balloon” or cLOUDDEAD’s “(Cloud Dead Number Five) (1)”. Eventually Williams’ drums disappear and the synths are left to rise, giving the sensation that you’re in a hot air balloon about the disappear into the clouds.Better still are the album’s deliciously paced two closing moments: “collaborate With God,” featuring French composer and Frank Ocean collaborator Chassol and its subsequent remix by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, provider of strings for Niño and others in the Brainfeeder\\/Leaving headspace. Of the two, the Chassol-only version is preferable, remaining a Jamire Williams track in feel. The latter, while excellent, is dominated by the Atwood-Ferguson strings and shifts the backdrop to something more like moody spy music. On \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual, Williams shows himself to be both an inspired composer and tasteful crafter of sound. He can build whole worlds worth spending time in with nothing but drum hits. But, as the fuller tracks suggest, he might  make something even deeper and richer if he allowed even one or two more primary colors into the frame. \\/\\/\\/\\/\\/ Effectual provides a powerful blueprint to build on. \"],[22691,\"For over a decade now, The-Dream has demonstrated a keen emotional intelligence, a willingness to throw his heart on the table, and an uncanny understanding of the female psyche—all while coming through with dozens of brilliantly dummy sing-along choruses made for belting and drunk dancing. As a songwriter\\/producer\\/singer, he’s breathed melody into his own songs as well as hits by Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Kanye West, adding humor and grace to their superstar personas. With his finest work—think “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” or “Fancy”—it can feel like he went to the mountaintop, met the god of song, and returned with a message.But he’s never been able to truly take off as a solo artist; after scoring a few minor hits with his first couple of albums, his own work has been met with an increasing indifference by the masses across the last six years. His latest EP, Love You to Death, won’t do much to change that. It’s just as layered and melodic as ever, but unless a more adventurous quiet storm DJ latches onto it, it won’t make it out of bedrooms. Which is where some of it belongs. Over a squiggly flute on “Madness,” a musically adventurous booty call, he rivals the raunchiest of rappers: “I would die to put my lips on it\\/I would love to rub my face in it\\/But you just gotta rub my face in it.”But blunt literalism isn’t his most powerful gift. He’s such a master of songwriting that he can play with language, lodging not just a phrase in your ear, but even abstract baby talk—think the “ellas” and “ehs” on Rihanna’s “Umbrella,” which he co-wrote. Similarly, Love You to Death opener “Lemon Lean,” the most obviously catchy song here, has no chorus other than some high-pitched cooing, but it’ll run like ticker tape through your head for days.Along with lust, The-Dream is always drowning in desire or regret, wrenching emotions that live very close to each other in the heart. And suffer he does on Love You to Death. “Daddy told me good pussy could kill ya,” he memorably laments on “Rih-Flex,” a clever ode to Rihanna. “I forgot about them things you did in college\\/Can you forget about them things I did last night?” he asks on “College Daze,” in a subtle nod to “Be Careful” by Sparkle and one of his clear inspirations, R. Kelly. Like Kellz or Jill Scott, The-Dream taps into the real grit of relationships by using ’round-the-way colloquialisms (“Now I don’t wanna just buy you shit… girl I wonder how lit you get”), yet he also has no problem elevating language and extending metaphors, either, alluding to a relationship teetering on the brink of failure in “Ferris Wheel.”By his own admission, The-Dream is less blessed as a singer than a songwriter and a producer, but that calling-card falsetto sounds crystalline here, and his note intervals are precise, shimmery, and sweet. The disappointments in this moody, make-up babymaker of an EP, then, have more to do with its tone. None of the songs trot along on his signature bright chords, and the closest he comes to going faster is at the very end (but if you’re using the EP as intended, well, perhaps it’s paced perfectly). While lush as ever, the songs never quite catch the “ghost”—that ineffable, humbling streak of god in songs that reduce you to tears—like “Fancy,” “Rockin’ That Shit,” “Yamaha,” and others did. Still, he has captured greatness more often than nearly any other modern-day triple threat, and that alone should make you scream his name.\"],[22702,\"The Bay Area metal lifers who comprise Worm Ouroboros are individually responsible for some of the heaviest music in the underground, but together they take a subtler, slower approach. Equally akin to ’80s acts like This Mortal Coil or Cocteau Twins as their contemporaries on the Profound Lore imprint, Worm Ouroboros inhabit a ghostly, gothy atmosphere. Since debuting in 2007, they have competently inverted the traditional structure of doom metal and post-rock (unrelentingly heavy albums with ambient interludes), making music that glides patiently and quietly, exploding only when the tension can no longer be contained.Like Come the Thaw, their excellent 2012 album and first with Agalloch\\/VHOL drummer Aesop Dekker, their follow-up What Graceless Dawn is only six tracks long, though it spans over an hour. Tellingly, it takes Worm Ouroboros 15 minutes into the album and halfway through the second track, “Broken Movements,” before they unleash the full force of their sound. Until then, it’s mostly whispered vocals over Jessica Way’s chilly guitars and Lorraine Rath’s slithering basslines, with Dekker’s artful drumming knocking eerily against the walls. When “Broken Movements” reaches its climax, they all converge into a thunderous roar. Rath and Way wrap their vocals around each other like a string section, soaring over Way’s crushing riffs; together their voices form the guiding light of the album. But while Worm Ouroboros have never sounded more powerful as a three-piece, these type of crescendos are not the focus. The most crushing peaks instead come from its softer moments, like the heartbreaking coda to “(Was It) The Cruelest Thing” or the haunting intro of “Ribbon of Shadow.” Throughout the record, the trio maintains a consistent, earthy mood, occasionally playing off one another with the intuition of an improv group. It pushes Warm Ouroboros to new heights. Way’s guitar can reverberate with a lonely, Lost Highway howl and sparkle with a metallic shimmer, often lending the album its texture; Rath’s bass playing serves as its melodic foundation. Dekker, meanwhile, eschews his typical assault with a more dynamic palette. His slow patter in the midsection of “Suffering Tree” gives it the feeling of an apocalyptic Christmas carol, while his dramatic, double bass drum rolls in “(Was It) The Cruelest Thing” provide a late-album burst of adrenaline.While each of the album’s songs take a similar route through their 10-minute runtimes, Worm Ouroboros layer their music with enough nuances to keep things from getting too dense. As indicated by their band name, which is derived from the title of a cultishly beloved 20th century sci-fi novel, Worm Ouroboros have a literary flair. It’s inherent to their deeply poetic lyrics (“Weighing our worth in sacks of black earth\\/Filling our hearts and our graves with their sum”) and by the whispered passages of William Blake that open and close the album. Blake’s poems also give the record its bookending track titles, “Day” and “Night,” suggesting that What Graceless Dawn thematically covers a 24-hour span. This might be true (particularly if the span of your day mostly involves staring awestruck at a blackening sky, contemplating mortality with a lingering sense of dread). But Worm Ouroboros’ power feels mysterious and eternal: In just an hour, they conjure up an entire lifetime of darkness.\"],[22718,\"Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor has spent decades griping about the music business, dating back to his complaints about TVT in 1992 and his resulting “secret recording sessions” of the Broken EP. Now in some ways, he is the music business, a power player whose pioneering moves—surprise releases, extreme secrecy, fanbase cultivation, big budget commercial soundtrack jobs—have become global-pop-star S.O.P. So when he boldly introduces his surprise new EP Not the Actual Events as “an unfriendly, fairly impenetrable record that we needed to make” there is some cause for both intrigue and healthy skepticism. For longtime followers of Reznor, a few scenarios suggest themselves. Maybe he's hoping to stoke enthusiasm for a slight, 21-minute EP that mainly serves as a promotional tool for a trove of concurrent reissues. Maybe he thinks he's done something remarkable, because he still sees himself as an innovator, even though his output since reforming NIN in 2005 has been well-textured but either comfortably formulaic (With Teeth, Hesitation Marks, The Slip's first half) or uncomfortably ambitious (Ghosts I-IV, the second half of The Slip, parts of Year Zero). Optimists and diehards might wish for a third option: Maybe he's legitimately produced powerful and fresh music under the Nine Inch Nails banner. To Reznor’s credit and detriment, he's managed to touch on each scenario. There are only a handful of examples in Reznor’s post-millennial NIN output where the group have departed from their turbulent, sturm-und-drang industrialism. There’s the piano and Vocoder-driven disco barnburner “All The Love In the World,” opener to the otherwise-toothless With Teeth; the gloomy, overlong and under-baked instrumentals-only closet-cleaner Ghosts I-IV; and on 2013’s Hesitation Marks, the baffling, sunny “Everything,” a rare major-key tune in the band’s catalog. The more interesting of these, “All the Love in the World” and “Everything,” are the opposite of “unfriendly” or “impenetrable”—their disarming warmth is what makes them memorable. Nine Inch Nails have spent nearly thirty years trading on a signature type of abrasive, parents-repelling industrial melancholia—they’ve provided decades’ worth of precedent in this style, and it would be it pretty damned difficult to release anything that could notably set itself apart on these terms. The band’s most “impenetrable” release so far is Ghosts, which demonstrates how that word can frequently mean “boring.”Despite its rough-edges production, Not the Actual Events is neither unfriendly nor is it inaccessible, especially for fans. It does, however, deliver a kind of visceral fury that NIN hasn’t recreated since its mid-’90s Downward Spiral heyday. “Burning Bright (Field on Fire)” begins with a detuned, overdrive-saturated guitar riff reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine rather than the crunchy, sharp riffs of standard NIN before erupting into a swarm of shimmering guitars that give the synesthesiastic effect of being inside the field aflame. The song doesn’t necessarily go anywhere, but its crude, unhinged force feels vital. On “Branches\\/Bones,” the band stays truer to their post-2005 form. A textbook post-Fragile NIN single, it follows in the efficient and winning form of The Slip’s “1,000,000” and “Discipline” or the Nirvana-meets-NIN 2009 single “Not So Pretty Now,” tracks that show Reznor as a biting pop songwriter rather than a brooding noisemaker. However, his decisions to wedge in a chorus of “It’s like I’ve been here before!” and cut the proceedings off abruptly after less than two minutes feel perverse, suggesting a desire to tease what’s worked in the past but deny the full-on pleasure of nostalgia. Unfortunately, the album’s other three tracks don’t bring enough new ideas or fun to justify that denial. The burbling synth number “Dear World,” goes nowhere and says little, while cacophonous album centerpiece “She’s Gone Away” is a spiritual sister to “Burning Bright” but plods rather than runs; at six minutes of churning sludge, you wish Reznor would have lopped off two and half and added them to the opener. Penultimate headbanger “The Idea of You” resembles a Broken-era track updated for 1997’s Reznor-produced Lost Highway soundtrack, with ear-shredding trebly guitar riffs reminiscent of (gulp) NIN-lovers Rammstein and the clear, plaintively struck piano notes from Reznor solo cut “Driver Down.”It’s disappointing that after a four-year wait—let alone the pretension of “[it’s] a record we needed to make”—Not the Actual Events turns out to be so slight, at just five tracks with no dramatic shift in form. It’s the least essential non-instrumental album the band has released. But with the subsequent announcement that “two major events” for NIN in 2017 are now also promised, perhaps Reznor himself knows this already, and it will turn out that that this slight record was in fact, not the actual event.\"],[22706,\"In New York’s experimental scene, the presence of vocalist Amirtha Kidambi on a concert bill has been a consistent indicator of quality. In 2013, she impressed in a live appearance with the legendary composer and improviser Muhal Richard Abrams. At the 2014 Whitney Biennial, she was part of a youthful ensemble that gave the premiere of one of the final operas by the late visionary Robert Ashley. Until forming the group Elder Ones, though, Kidambi had yet to create a vehicle for her own compositions. The quartet that plays on her bandleading debut includes some familiar talents. Drummer Max Jaffe’s jabbing power has been heard in the high-complexity pop of the band JOBS. Soprano saxophonist Matt Nelson’s work has proved critical to recordings by tUnE-yArDs and Battle Trance. But Kidambi is the clear driving agent of the group.While her mostly wordless vocal parts on Holy Science are influenced by the South Indian devotional singing groups she participated in as a child, they also call to mind her past work with composer Darius Jones. Kidambi’s simultaneous harmonium playing reflects her ongoing study of India’s Carnatic classical tradition, as well as her appreciation of modern drone music. And the feeling of free jazz—in particular, the high-intensity blast of late Coltrane—is often present here. That’s a lot of material for any composer to process usefully, but Kidambi and Elder Ones distinguish themselves by fusing these influences with a point of view all their own. With each lengthy track titled after a yuga (or “eon”) in Hindu scripture, Holy Science clearly has significant thematic ambitions. Yet Kidambi’s 64-minute suite contains lively, minute-to-minute variety, in addition to a grand overall design. The title of the opening movement, “Sathya Yuga,” references an ancient eon in Hindu mythology—one in which spiritual enlightenment was widespread. The track opens with the leader’s voice and harmonium playing, and the texture is meditative. Kidambi’s singing has the feel of mantra, with certain groups of syllables receiving devoted repetition. But she also adds to the lines as she goes along, creating a searching quality.When Jaffe enters, he plays in free-time, often using cymbals to accentuate the vocal lines. After Nelson’s soprano sax joins, nearly three minutes in, he and Kidambi begin experimenting—very softly—with unusual harmonies. After a brief solo harmonium drone, a rhythmic vamp is introduced, via Brandon Lopez’s bass. And then the entire band carries this new material to a full boil, with “Sathya Yuga” climaxing in a fiercely swinging, post-minimalist melodic progression. This is a happy intensity: full of a community vibe as well as opportunities for individual expression. But it is not the end of the story.Since subsequent yugas narrate a descent into fractious conflict, the album’s next movement (“Treta-yuga”) incorporates a greater sense of alarm. Here, the free jazz riffs are more anxious sounding. Nelson’s soprano sax language adds in some of the piercing effects heard in the music of virtuosos like Roscoe Mitchell. But still, in moments when the players’ parts fall in-line together, there’s a sense of hard-won beauty.Things fall apart more completely during the third movement, “Dvapara Yuga (for Eric Garner).” Kidambi composed this piece in the hours after first seeing the horrifying cellphone video of Garner’s death at the hands of police officers in the summer of 2014. And Kidambi’s choice to place this contemporary reference in this album’s evocation of the Dvapara eon is smart, and chilling. In Hindu scripture, this is only the second most destructive epoch—and the one in which the Bhagavad Gita is recited. That text, influential to a wide range of thinkers that includes Thoreau, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, centers on a cosmic battle between warring factions in society: a span of carnage that often results in empty victories.Here, the evocation of ancient and contemporary questions about violence and moral response proves gripping. At the end of this cacophonous movement, Kidambi sounds depleted. Nelson’s saxophone lines are similarly strained—a harrowing reference to Garner’s own increasingly desperate struggle to breathe, as seen on the video that documents his death. At all times, this track works as an oath. In its opening section, it swears memory to a victim. By its close, it promises enduring opposition to unjust outcomes.Even though the suite still has one more era to explore, Holy Science’s relationship to the legacy of free-jazz protest is most pronounced in that third movement. And by this point, it’s clear that Kidambi has managed to house all of her influences in a project that is original. This sound isn’t merely the product of well-chosen reference points; in its abstract way, it makes a unique argument for the virtue of cross-cultural curiosity. Appropriately, the nature of this music is constantly morphing. When a muted introduction gives way to a more celebratory aesthetic, the change is achieved gradually, through small changes in the arrangement. When a demonstration of rage reaches a peak that cannot be sustained, the musicians in Elder Ones are able to navigate back to a more stable feel, without losing the passion and awareness that has animated those foregoing blasts of harshness. The result is an astonishing debut for a composer, and her band.\"],[22695,\"It’s been nearly fourteen years since we last heard new music from beloved K Records heroes the Microphones. After following up their 2001 classic The Glow, Pt. 2 with the challenging and somewhat inscrutable Mount Eerie, they dissolved abruptly before the band—more or less the work of Anacortes, WA resident Phil Elverum and a rotating band of collaborators—confusingly re-emerged a year later as Mount Eerie, having ditched the Microphones moniker in exchange for the name of that final record. Though Elverum has gone on to release more than twelve records over that span, and much of that music covers some of the territory his former band walked, the precise spirit of naive quirkiness of the Microphones has never quite since been replicated.Now in 2016 Elverum has decided to reactivate that old appellation, on a release of twenty-year-old material likely to be unfamiliar to even fans of the band. Titled EARLY TAPES, 1996-98, it’s exactly as stated—a compilation of sixteen songs either previously unreleased or taken from limited release tapes from Beat Happening guitarist Bret Lunsford’s Knw-Yr-Own cassette label. Many fans of the band eager for more Microphones may have had hopes, but to be clear, EARLY TAPES is no “lost classic”; it’s about as definitively a “for the fans” release as you can get. As Elverum himself admits, “Listening back to this music now is mostly embarrassing to me.” And as to why he’s dug finally them out now: “I am still basically an overgrown teenager postponing a real job.” It’s both a completely reasonable motivation for a musician trying to make it in 2016, and still, despite the limited quality of the contents, a valuable exercise for fans of either the band or the era. The value of EARLY TAPES, slightness of the output notwithstanding, is testament to the enduring power of the Microphones and the way they stood in to represent a thriving part of Pacific Northwest indie. Even the album’s first track, the previously unreleased early-days cut “Teenage Moustache”—the album’s silliest moment if not its slightest—manages to conjures a nostalgia not just for the innocent sweetness of early Elverum\\/Microphones, but also wooly ’90s DIY indie rock (especially of the K Records variety) and the exploding sense of total possibility in the late pre-internet age. The semi-tuned thriftstore guitar recalls the more ramshackle ditties of Beck’s One Foot in the Grave and Stereopathetic Soulmanure, and the vocals recall the teenage warbles on Modest Mouse’s Sad Sappy Sucker. It’s not a great song by any stretch, but there’s something powerful and pleasant about it. Thankfully, it’s not all just nostalgia. There are at least a handful of noteworthy new arrivals on EARLY TAPES. Chief among these is the heart-tugging “Compressor,” which unsurprisingly also serves as the album’s teaser single. A simple concoction of a drummer-boy snare shuffle, two-note guitar lines, and a rhythmic tattoo of a chorus, it resembles a Notwist Neon Golden outtake “ft. Phil Elverum.” The six-minute epic “Wires and Cords” is equally strong, the lone track here that points directly to the force they would become. Elverum also answers a longtime mystery in the song’s liner notes by explaining the original meaning of the band’s name, and why he abandoned it: “My music project was about recording and the terminology around it, vaguely trying to say emotional human stuff using this equipment as a vocabulary....This is towards the end of me trying to use recording technology metaphors and the beginning of the irrelevance of my band name.” An ode of sorts to one of Elverum’s obsessions, Stereolab, this organ-driven love note to former girlfriend and bandmate Bronwyn Holm shows Elverum beginning to look beyond sound sketches and imagining the great possibility of songs as storybooks. Both “Microphone, Pt. 1” and especially the Rentals-en-français “Microphone, Pt. 2” are low-key winners as well.Many of the other inclusions on EARLY TAPES really are of the throwaway variety—go-nowhere instrumentals like “For Kaye June 6” or “(Bass)” whose mundanity suffers further for lacking at least the gut-warming tickle of Elverum’s frail voice. But there’s a wide enough variety to keep the proceedings from dragging and even the weakest moments offer at least a little charm, such as “The Creeps”’s calliope-style noir or “Rebirth on Tape Deck Mountain”’s meditative circular guitar melody.It’s understandable why Elverum felt he had to leave the Microphones behind; sometimes, it’s hard to feel like you’re really growing without a conscious decision to shed your skin, even if the snake underneath is ultimately the same. It’s a testament to that original band’s lasting power and impact that something EARLY TAPES even has an audience at all. The Glow, It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water, and Don’t Wake Me Up will all remain higher listening priorities than EARLY TAPES, but it’s nice to know this exists. \"],[22713,\"How do you stage an opera that mostly takes places inside a child’s murderous mind? That was one problem facing composer Ben Frost and librettist David Pountney when they set out to make a musical theater piece—Frost’s first ever—of Iain Banks’ 1984 psychological horror novel, The Wasp Factory. The book tells the tale of a psychopathic teen named Frank, who devises bizarre, violent rituals on a desolate Scottish island. Another problem: Frank is a misogynist, and this is no time for the glorification of misogynistic antiheroes.Frost solved both problems in one stroke by asking Pountney to split Frank’s phantasmagoric monologue into a trialogue. Then he assigned the three roles to powerful women, entirely omitting Frank as a character. On this newly-released Bedroom Community recording—the opera premiered in 2013—they are sung with wicked charisma by Lieselot De Wilde, Jördis Richter, and Mariam Wallentin. Not merely aspects of Frank’s psyche, they’re like the Furies, bearers of divine retribution. With justified ferocity, they chew and spit Frank’s infernal confession, and Frost’s music, played by the Reykjavík Sinfonia, coldly stokes the flames.The Australia-born, Iceland-based Frost is popularly known for his electro-acoustic hybrids of classical music and heavy metal. He combines post-minimal finesse with modernist severity and Wagnerian daring, charging into the deepest abysses of quiet and storming up the fieriest peaks of noise. Though the focus is now live sound and the human voice, The Wasp Factory should still resonate with fans of his ambient music. It’s By the Throat inverted, foregrounding classical and recessing electronics, with no entropy in Frost’s signature blend of concussive brawn, delicate tissue, and intricate logic.A small string ensemble pulses in tight swarms, slashing out parallelograms in a holographic medium of bass and distortion. As always, Frost’s hyperreal acoustical shapes don’t seem symbolic—they just uncannily exist, deforming spacetime. This is captured in a recording of rapt, intrusive closeness, the singers lunging into your face, unlike the polite remove typical of classical music.It’s not the only way The Wasp Factory bucks operatic convention. Don’t expect Italianate phrasing or proper coloratura. The vocal lines are lean and soulful, more like jazz, blues, cabaret, and pop. The belling timbre on “Blyth” is very Björk, while the indecorous bellow of “Wrong!” on “I See You’ve Washed Your Hands Again” is midway between Benjamin Britten, composer of Peter Grimes, and Nicki Minaj on “Monster.” If you’ve been looking for an accessible way into contemporary opera, this could very well be it. (If you’ve been listening to art music by the likes of Jenny Hval, let alone Shara Worden’s chamber operas, you’re almost there.)Frost is well suited to a narrative form like opera because his music is dense with acoustical narratives, interlocked from the atomic to the cosmic level. A single bass drop on “I See You’ve Washed Your Hands Again” tells a whole story in seconds. It’s nested in the shape of the song, an inexorable grip and release. “My Greatest Enemies Are Women and the Sea” rises to a vertex right in the middle, as the title line is sung, flooding it with climactic power. And these well shaped songs are also absorbed in an album-long struggle from dark to light, as a pearly shimmer gradually emerges from the dark, lush crags of the early reaches.The Wasp Factory is mad but serene, vile but alluring. The plot is strictly nightmarish. Frank’s brother has escaped from the hospital, and the exact length of a certain knife must be ascertained; he murders his cousin Blyth, with an artificial leg, using a venomous snake. Stark vignettes divulge Frank’s brutality to animals (and worse), his obsession with what it means to exist. “To be mastered,” we learn, “the world must be named.” Frank can find mastery only in violence, which infests his language. The opera’s title refers to a maze he makes from a clock where wasps meet various gruesome ends. To Frank, it’s a divination device; to us, it’s a searing illustration of a worldview in which time and life are machines that manufacture doom. Frost winds this bleak psychology with shockingly beautiful music, and finds in opera an exciting new form of expression for his profoundly psychological sonic abstractions. \"],[22705,\"Kacey Musgraves continues to follow her arrow. In 2013, she built her reputation as an antidote to all that was said to be ailing country music: a traditionalist of unobtrusively twangy arrangements and a credible small-town Texas background, who was also slyly progressive in her down-home narratives. She cowrote Miranda Lambert’s deliciously vengeful mini-masterpiece “Mama’s Broken Heart” and released her own major-label debut, Same Trailer Different Park, which beat out Taylor Swift and the genre’s swaggering bros to win the Best Country Album Grammy. In 2015, she released Pageant Material; that record didn’t go big, it went home, eschewing radio-friendly hits to double down gorgeously on the gentle, folksy nuance of its predecessor. It opened at No. 1 but didn’t sell as well overall.Its follow-up, A Very Kacey Christmas, is yet another left turn from Musgraves. The third album is pretty early in an artist’s catalog for a holiday record, but she throws herself into this one as wholeheartedly as any proper LP. Her great epiphany is the short distance between rhinestones and aluminum trees, how what once was considered tacky and artificial can, with time, come to seem nostalgic and real. Musgraves’ album summons up the mid-’60s era nostalgia of A Charlie Brown Christmas, gliding naturally from her established Western-swing throwback aesthetic to kitschy exotica and vintage pop, with an expertly curated song selection that leans on campy novelties, classy standards, and a stocking’s worth of originals.Because our Christmas recordings pile up over the years, to be dusted off with the other decorations for a few weeks and then put back in their boxes, they may be one of the few types of albums many people still play in full. The sequencing of A Very Kacey Christmas exploits this advantage. Musgraves doesn’t rush her conceit, opening elegantly but conventionally with cello and pedal steel on “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” followed by a sleigh bells- and fiddle-accented “Let It Snow” with fellow Western swingers the Quebe Sisters. She shows her hand next on—of all things!—a polka-like cover of “Christmas Don’t Be Late,” a\\/k\\/a “The Chipmunk Song.” Replacing the cartoon characters’ irritating high-pitched voices with Musgraves’ crystalline effortlessness (and ditching the “ALVIN!!!” banter) renders this familiar bit of silliness deeply affecting; when Musgraves sings, “I still want a hula-hoop,” it’s with the poignancy of a adult yearning for all that she didn’t get in Christmases past.The other non-originals are cut from similarly elvin-green cloth, and they’re thoroughly enjoyable if less revelatory. Musgraves salvages “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas,” an oft-annoying mid-century gag record, gamely singing about not wanting “rhinoceroses-es.” She delivers an effectively restrained “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” with children chiming in with schoolyard backing vocals. Elsewhere, Musgraves lets the band’s instrumental prowess shine in a nimble, mariachi-flavored “Feliz Navidad.” Another song about various cultural ways of saying merry Christmas, the Hawaiian ditty “Mele Kalikimaka,” piles on the pedal steel, with the Quebe Sisters returning on close-knit harmonies. Ending with a woozy “What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve?”—capped by a snatch of “Auld Lang Syne” on piano, around a hearth of ambient chatter—feels obvious but fitting, like watching It’s a Wonderful Life on Christmas Eve.The four originals here vary in their success, “A Willie Nice Christmas,” if you’ll forgive a pun (and you’ll have to) is Musgraves’ weed-heavy holiday reunion with Willie Nelson, whose 1965 song “Are You Sure” she rebooted with him on Pageant Material. It is hardly essential, but notable for merely existing: Musgraves, who once sang, “I’m always higher than my hair,” name-checks “On the Road Again” and hopes “we’ll all stay higher than the star at the top of the tree,” as Nelson genially reminds us not to get so stressed. “Present Without a Bow,” which features Musgraves’ fellow classicist Leon Bridges, reaches for the holiday soulfulness of a song like Charles Brown’s “Please Come Home for Christmas,” but it doesn’t quite cohere. “Ribbons and Bows,” an upbeat hand-clapper in the Ronettes and Darlene Love mode, feels like a potential single, with “All I Want for Christmas Is You”-style lyrics channeled through Musgraves’ eye for what “the ladies [down] at the hair salon” will say.The real gift here is “Christmas Makes Me Cry,” a gut-punching acoustic ballad that Musgraves cowrote with Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally. While another country star with crossover ability, Dolly Parton, sang about keeping a stiff upper lip in her “Hard Candy Christmas,” Musgraves confides now that Nat King Cole, starry-eyed kids, and “seeing mom and dad get a little grayer” each year never fails to bring tears to her eyes. “Another year gone by\\/Just one more that I\\/I couldn't make it home,” she sings. For all her retro leanings, she wisely chooses to sing about contemporary people trying our damndest to be cheerful and loving in a particularly hectic—and, often, sad and heavy—time of year. Getting a little misty-eyed around the holidays? Now that’s a sentiment everyone can appreciate, in any era.\"],[22532,\"2016 has been a surreal and absurd year for most, but what a whirlwind it must have been for Melina Duterte. The San Francisco musician who performs as Jay Som (a moniker meaning “Victory Moon” and pulled from a baby name generator a la Childish Gambino) toured with Mitski and Japanese Breakfast, released a 7” on Fat Possum, opened for Peter Bjorn and John, signed to Polyvinyl, and has been working on a debut LP. This flurry of activity is largely the result of a tipsy decision made on Thanksgiving 2015, when Duterte spontaneously dropped a nine-track collection of “unfinished and finished songs” onto Bandcamp under the name Untitled. “It was completely unplanned,” Duterte told Rookie. “I didn’t even think about the track listing or the album artwork or the order of songs. I have a ton of these songs, and from them I picked nine.”That these tracks, later retitled as Turn Into, are technically demos is essential to understanding why the collection has been re-released twice, first by Top Shelf and later by Polyvinyl. Each track is a deeply polished offering that reflects Duterte’s past musical experience and forecasts her promising future. She grew up playing the trumpet and planned to attend a conservatory program after high school to pursue her love of jazz. Instead, after realizing that she wanted to continue songwriting, she enrolled at community college to study music production and recording. She turned her bedroom into a studio, even removing the bed to install a drum set and puttered around with the tracks that would become Turn Into. She plays every instrument on the album, a feat that may remind some of Alex G’s home recordings, in addition to mixing and mastering. Turn Into kicks off with “Peach Boy,” a kaleidoscopic dream-pop number featuring lush vocals and elastic wah-wah guitar effects (appropriately, considering Duterte’s history, early wah pedals were called “Clyde McCoy”s after the jazz trumpeter). Clouds move in for “Ghost” and the daydreaming melodies turn gloomy as Duterte confronts her fears. “Being scared is a huge theme of the album,” Duterte told San Francisco’s KQED, and even its most upbeat, these songs contain undercurrents of anxiety. There are moments on the album where you can feel her audibly pushing against these restraints, like on “Next to Me,” when she calls out “I’m waiting too long I’ve had it I want to scream\\/And fuck being patient I’m fragile I’m not weak” before disappearing back into the squall. Turn Into clouds into melancholy during its middle third. “Drown” resembles My Bloody Valentine at their most mellow or Mazzy Star at their murkiest. “Our Red Door” and “Unlimited Touch” feature woozy, extended instrumental swirls that invite you to drift with them.  “Why I Say No” and “SLOW” wend slowly back into warmer territory before pale sunlight of the title track pokes through. The slinky guitars and wistful vocals recall Death Cab’s “Your Heart Is an Empty Room,” and confirms that Jay Som is a multifaceted project, capable of painting in multiple shades. \"],[22701,\" The phrase “mastered by Rashad Becker” in an album’s liner notes confers a seal of approval that can't be equaled. As engineer at Berlin’s Dubplates & Mastering, Becker’s name can be found on almost any noteworthy techno or experimental release of the past twenty years. His own music came as a pleasant surprise when he released his debut album for PAN with 2013’s Traditional Music of Notional Species, Vol. 1. At that time, he already had 1200 titles with his credit on them. With Vol. 2, a look at his Discogs page reveals that tally is now nearing 1600 releases. That Becker even has time to contemplate his own music seems impossible, like the leader of a country also having spare time to executive produce a television show. Much like his first album, he breaks the sides (none of which pass the 4:45 mark) into “Themes” and “Dances,” though one would be hard-pressed to determine the concepts underpinning one side, much less figure out just what moves and steps would comprise the latter. As the title suggests, it’s an album redolent of Smithsonian Folkways’ field recordings from Africa and Indonesia, with nods to early musique concrète and intercepted extraterrestrial transmissions. So maybe it’s closest comparison is to the ritualistic sounds of alien tribes as overheard by a curious visitor. “Themes VII” wheezes and lurches and bumps into things, while “Themes VI” rattles like a china cabinet loaded into a UFO. The near-vocal quality of his sounds and their cartoonish weirdness brings to mind Hans Reichel’s self-made daxophone, a bizarre wooden instrument that you bow to elicit sounds. “Dances V” stretches and purrs like some space-age polymer while Becker gets an especially nougat-y bass tone for “Dances VI.”Whenever Becker conjures a familiar sound, he quickly husks history, meaning and expectations from it so that it might quiver in space all on its own, like a cell under a microscope. A mental picture that forms at the beginning of a piece will lose its meaning by the end. So yes, “Themes V” has frequencies suggesting struck metal and the rhythms of a gamelan ensemble. But what to make of the worming frequencies, shortwave static and what sounds like a thrummed comb that then intrude upon the track? His tracks bring sounds, descriptors, and language itself into question.“Notional” becomes the operative word here, as each piece feels conjectural, possible but unreal. There is, again, a folkloric tinge, an echo of music from peoples in other parts of the world never previously encountered by the West. Much like early electronic music and musique concrète anticipated the means that lies behind most modern music-making—even though it seemed to merely be noise and gibberish at the time—there’s an aspect of Becker’s work that sounds like nonsense, yet also hints at what we might deem music in another half-century.  \"],[22707,\"All is not well with Ray Charles’ catalog nowadays. Digital retailers in the US can’t sell or stream the entirety of titles like Genius + Soul = Jazz. Same goes for both volumes of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. While the pianist, vocalist, and composer’s essential 1950s sessions for Atlantic Records remain in print, CD editions of his classic 1960s albums for ABC are only available on budget import labels. One exception to that rule—Concord’s five-CD box of the ABC singles, issued in 2011—has already been discontinued. This isn’t remotely fine. But until new distribution agreements are hammered out, that’s where the situation rests.At least the general scarcity has a way of making a fresh discovery seem all the more exciting. Now, a new entry in the long-running “Swiss Radio Days” reissue series gives us Zurich 1961, a concert that certainly qualifies as thrilling. On this 79-minute gig, captured that year in a Swiss concert hall, Charles’ big band rips into a few tunes he’d already made popular, in addition to songs and arrangements crafted by a certain up-and-coming talent named Quincy Jones. (The two men met in their teens; Jones later gave Charles some arrangements that he’d already released on his own.)Charles’ band begins this Zurich date with two Jones charts: “Happy Faces” (originally by Sonny Stitt) and then “Along Came Betty” (a Benny Golson composition). The opener leaps out with an urgency that stacks up well against Jones’ original version (as heard on The Birth of a Band LP). Charles isn’t audible on these first two performances, but his band delivers the hard-charging riffs and cooler, finger-snapping rhythms with regal confidence.Charles’ composition “My Baby” follows, and the track serves as his formal introduction to the audience—as well as that of the Raelettes, a quartet of backup singers. As an ensemble within the larger group, the Raelettes provide suave harmonies and bluesy, solo exclamations. They offer swinging support behind Charles’ lead vocals during the uptempo “Sticks and Stones”—a cover that Charles found success with, two years prior. The only thing dragging this song down is the fact that the leader’s piano is mixed too low. As the crowd’s post-song applause dies away, you can hear a tense bit of chatter from Charles, addressed to an unidentified colleague, as the pianist slides into the introduction of “Georgia on My Mind.” (At one point, it sounds like he says, “I can’t hear, man; I told you.”)The balance problems are fixed in a hurry. The subsequent performance of “Georgia” is a soulful revelation, as Charles stretches the tune to over six minutes, supported by bass and flute. He teases like hell with his vocal and piano lines, while David Newman’s flute pirouettes in a showier manner. At its close, the full band’s entrance makes for deliriously hot stuff. After you’ve heard this take, you might never need to hear the comparatively chaste studio version ever again.The rest of the concert repeats this recipe: an extended jam that allows big band members to flex their soloing muscles, and doesn’t always feature direct involvement from Charles himself (including “Blue Stone,” written by Charles’ musical director, Hank Crawford.) Then he swoops in to make everything that much better, as you can hear on a strutting sequence that includes “Margie” and “Hit the Road Jack.”By this point, all of Charles’s contributions are being mixed properly—and everything is coming up god-level. His high screams and gully-low growls cavort with barroom piano trills during “I’ve Got News for You.” The Raelettes outdo their past work with Charles on a shattering, occasionally hushed “I Believe to My Soul.” This version of “Come Rain or Come Shine,” in a modernized Jones arrangement, is another powerhouse that makes the canonic ‘50s studio reading seem bashful. The blending of styles is so transporting, it can be easy to neglect all that's going on—the flashes of R&B, soul-jazz, gospel, post-bop and blues that pull together. The result is some of the best American pop that’s ever been made. The way things have been going in the world of distribution, this CD will probably fall out of print in a few months. Sleep on it at your own risk. \"],[22708,\"Occultist and ceremonial magician Aleister Crowley once said “I slept with faith and found a corpse in my arms on awakening; I drank and danced all night with doubt and found her a virgin in the morning.” Parsing this opaque statement reveals it was just Crowley’s cryptic, verbose way of devaluing faith and championing skepticism; a fake-deep principle demeaning the moralist position, the “Gotta Hear Both Sides” of a pseudo-cerebral ideology.It also reads like an Ab-Soul bar these days. It’s fitting that Crowley, once dubbed the Wickedest Man in the World and written off as a Satanist for his musings about the supernatural, has been a source of inspiration for TDE’s syllable-twisting, in-house conspiracy theorist, who is becoming so information-obsessed that he seems to be losing sight of actual meaning—perhaps a bit woozy from inhaling around all the tomes and scrolls and manuscripts he’s been dusting off. His songs have become so abstract that very little happens in them anymore; they’re all empty puzzles, mazes made of loosely parsed Greek myths, astrological information, and the unfinished script pages for National Treasure 3, meant to be mind-fucking but revealed to be mush when even gently interrogated. His new album, Do What Thou Wilt., named for the defining law of Crowley’s Thelemic philosophy, is the ultimate act of performative wokeness.It wasn’t always this way: Ab-Soul has been a thoughtful writer in the past, making sense of fringe sciences and unorthodox philosophies with elastic rhyme schemes, gently massaging them to suit grand proclamations about society’s shortcomings or personal explorations for spirituality. His breakout, Control System, remains among the best Top Dawg releases, boasting one of the most heart-wrenching and personal rap songs of the past several years (“The Book of Soul”). But the rapper has strayed from the confessional and introspective brand of stargazing that once made him one of rap’s most interesting voices. In recent outings, Soul has emerged as rap’s preeminent quasi-intellectual, besting peers like Lupe Fiasco and Jay Electronica (who he disses on Kendrick’s behalf here) with dramatic logical leaps, upping the ante with nonsense bars. Ab-Soul spends so much time mixing pagan and Christian texts on Do What Thou Wilt. that it’s unclear what exactly he believes, or worse, what he’s trying to persuade us to believe. These songs are mostly self-serving or pointless, and they all contain plenty of bad phonetic reaches and try-hard wordplay. There’s a song called “Huey Knew THEN.” (Get it?!) It interpolates the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” theme and he raps “I’m hornier than the brass section of the band, you understand?” This is what would happen if you gave Shia LaBeouf some DMT, a 12th Planet documentary, and a World Religions textbook. The production comes courtesy of longtime collaborators like Sounwave, Tae Beast, Willie B, and Skhye Hutch, names familiar to TDE canon like Rahki and the Antydote, and notable outside producers like WondaGurl and A$AP P on the Boards. It’s mostly dark and ominous, with sloping traditionalist breaks that slink just behind the downbeat. When it’s good, dense, or atmospheric like on “Braille” on “Now You Know,” it can settle Soul into a comfortable rhythm or obscure some of his worse lines; but when it’s bland (“Womanogamy”) or overwrought (“God’s a Girl?”), things become twice as grating, and often unlistenable. Do What Thou Wilt. has been billed both as a love story and a “woman-appreciation album.” It’s also supposedly an exploration of Crowley’s wicked objectives and Soul’s goal of being the most righteous man, among other stray themes. These many mismatching, criss-crossing threads create an incredibly convoluted 77-minute slog that is as tough to listen to as it is to digest. The overly-busy “God’s a Girl?” boasts the lines “You got me crying with a hard dick (amen)” and “come have sex with Jesus” in the first 35 seconds. “Wifey vs. WiFi \\/ \\/ \\/  P.M.S.” can’t decided if it’s a song about how digital communication interferes with intimacy or an extended prison metaphor. “Womanogamy” is a half-baked manifesto about liking girls that like girls that are in love with him; “RAW (backwards)” is a construction of lazy word games (“Man, I got so many flows them shits come with ceilings”); “YMF” or Young Mind Fuck, is lined with the most boring paradox of all-time: if Ab-Soul calls himself a liar, does that make him a liar, or is a liar calling himself a liar a lie? A better question: Who cares?Among the worst songs is “Threatening Nature,” a single that proved to be a microcosm of the entire project. It’s an undercooked concept with even flimsier raps that would get laughed out of a smoke circle of college freshmen: “With all disrespect, I think the American flag was designed by fags,” he says, a line that would probably be repugnantly offensive if it weren't so ridiculous. On “Evil Genius” Soul raps, “I studied theology, ancient philosophy, astronomy, astrology\\/The current state of the economy\\/Washington D.C., fossils and dinosaurs\\/The origin of our species.” Perhaps he should’ve spent a bit more time studying music.\"],[22559,\"“Fuck your magazine,” growls Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo on the album-opening title track of what is easily the most abrasive and chaotic album in the Texas thrash band's storied career. As its title suggests, The Great Southern Trendkill was supposed to be Pantera’s re-dedication of purpose amidst a musical climate where metal was falling out of favor. In a way, it was. More than that, however, the album exposes the personal turmoil that would later sink the band for good.Perhaps it’s understandable that Anselmo and company felt like the world was closing in on them. By the time they set out to make The Great Southern Trendkill in late ’95, Pantera were one of the lone remaining thrash-era metal acts that could still reasonably expect to shift half a million units. More crucially, they were one of the only ones doing so without diluting their sound. In fact, Pantera were growing more successful by getting heavier with each record. Whether or not we accept the popular narrative that the so-called alternative revolution had rendered metal “uncool” again, most of Pantera’s peers had hit steep career drop-offs and were struggling to remain visible. So it must have felt convenient for bands like them to point the finger at a fickle music establishment they felt was turning on them. But that was a curious position for Pantera to take considering they’d managed to achieve world-beater status in 1992—right in the heyday of Lollapalooza and 120 Minutes—and debuted at Number One on the Billboard album chart with 1994’s Far Beyond Driven. They may have seen it differently, but the truth is Pantera were riding a momentous wave of success when it came time to record The Great Southern Trendkill. And regardless, in spite of his chest-beating against the band's supposed enemies in the music press, on Southern Trendkill Anselmo exposes no one else but himself as his worst enemy. In one of the breakdown sections of second track “War Nerve,” for example, Anselmo stops singing altogether and spits-up a tirade: “For every fucking second the pathetic media pisses on me and judges what I am in one paragraph, look here: FUCK YOU ALLLLLLLLLLLL.” To be fair, Anselmo is hardly the first performer to vent against critics (and one can only imagine how much more venomous his lyrics would have been had music blogs like this one been as prominent back then as they are now). But it’s telling that he can't keep his ire focused on an external source for the entire song, which begins with the lines “Fuck the world for all it’s worth\\/Every inch of planet earth\\/Fuck myself\\/Don’t leave me out.” Sure, Anselmo’s stream-of-consciousness wordplay often targeted multiple adversaries in single songs in the past, but “War Nerve” betrays his then-increasing tendency towards self-loathing and incoherence. Anselmo caused a furor this past January when he made a Nazi-salute gesture and screamed “white power” onstage. Indeed, hints of Anselmo’s racial anxieties shadowed Pantera throughout their career, with Kurt Loder addressing them point-blank in a 1994 MTV News clip. And in a 1995 onstage rant that’s made the rounds on YouTube for years, Anselmo weighs-in on his disdain for rap culture and the “stop black-on-black crime” slogan in front of a Montreal audience. Though Anselmo starts off by saying “we’re not a racist band,” he later urges the audience to have pride in its white heritage.  Crucially, in that clip he uses the word “trend\\\\\" to describe what he’s railing against—the implied subtext being that we were moving too far towards a restrictive PC culture. It doesn’t take a mathematician to put two and two together here and see how easily such statements lend themselves to a white-supremacist agenda. And so hearing Anselmo spew bile against “trends” on the The Great Southern Trendkill, one has to wonder what else was on his mind that he didn’t have the guts to say flat-out. Whatever else you can say about him, though, you have to acknowledge that in his prime Anselmo was an electrifying performer—one of metal’s all-time greatest frontmen—with a relentless drive to create. (His prolific output in numerous bands bears that out.) Just four years earlier, Anselmo’s unparalleled intensity had supercharged the band's breakout album Vulgar Display of Power with an undeniable electricity. Listening to it, you couldn’t help but feel emboldened and empowered. Following up with Far Beyond Driven, Anselmo was able to keep up the same motivational demeanor, but a darker, more personal set of lyrics pointed to a cracking psyche behind the bravado. By the The Great Southern Trendkill, Anselmo’s psychic degeneration is alarmingly complete, and what was once a cathartic roar begins to verge on psychosis as Anselmo’s bandmates push themselves further and further to extremes as well. Previous Pantera albums presented aggression as an athletic high. By contrast, on Southern Trendkill’s most frantic moments, the aggression hews closer to self-mutilation—a last-ditch attempt to provoke sensation when you’re too numb to feel anything. On songs like the title track and “Suicide Note Pt. II,” Pantera trade-in their trademark high-velocity boogie grooves for blurry spasms of noise. Fittingly enough for a band so openly plagued by substance abuse problems, on Southern Trendkill the “high” in the heaviness is gone. The album offers zero of the euphoric rush of the band’s earlier efforts, and there's almost no release to be found in its negativity. All that’s left is to wallow in the despair. It was also telling that Anselmo—by this point deep in the throes of heroin and prescription painkiller addiction—recorded his vocals separately from the rest of the band at Trent Reznor’s Nothing studios in New Orleans while his bandmates recorded the music at guitarist Dimebag Darrell Abbott’s home studio in Dallas. According to the liner notes, Anselmo was actually present for writing and demo’ing material with the band in pre-production. But the fact that producer Terry Date needed to serve as go-between speaks to a communication block that couldn't have been good for the creative process. Nevertheless, even all that internal dysfunction wasn’t enough to blunt the searing vitality of the final product. When it comes to music that captures the personal implosion of an artist about to go off the rails, The Great Southern Trendkill is about as thrilling as they come. It’s also the first time that Anselmo truly shows his fragility, ugly and wretched as it may be. As harried as its outlook is, The Great Southern Trendkill's seething hopelessness reveals a desperation that Far Beyond Driven hinted at but downplayed in favor of balls-out swagger. This time, Pantera no longer sound larger-than-life but instead like actual three-dimensional (and very fucked-up) people.The Great Southern Trendkill gets extreme in spots, but it showcases the contrasts in the band’s musical DNA more than any of their other albums. The title track, for example, suddenly lurches from its blistering near-grindcore pace to a slow-moseying blues rock section laced with a trademark Dimebag solo, his love for original KISS guitarist Ace Frehley’s hummable leads still as evident as ever. Even more jarring, the energetic main riff on “Living Through Me (Hell’s Wrath)” recalls the vibe of classic ’80s thrash. But that period suddenly feels innocent and far back in the rearview mirror in comparison to the gloom that engulfs this album, especially when the song switches into a creepy dark-industrial mid-section that reflects its narrative about a harrowing sexual encounter between two junkies. In another experimental detour, on “Suicide Note Pt. 1” Pantera actually try their hand at an acoustic ballad. Perhaps more shockingly, the song sounds like a cross between (then-trendy!) Stone Temple Pilots and Zeppelin’s “Over the Hills and Far Away.” Anselmo—an infinitely more capable singer than his harsh screams might indicate—drops his guard and opens up about his own suicidal urges. For once, the band gives us a glimpse into pain that’s genuinely affecting. The Great Southern Trendkill’s rough-edged flaws help generate the music’s unique power almost as much as the band's blind determination to keep ratcheting-up the intensity level, come what may. It perhaps sums up the album’s mood best that, while touring to support it, Anselmo overdosed from heroin and was pronounced dead for over four minutes after a show in Dallas. Incredibly enough, he played the next show. Listening back to the album, both the overdose and the decision to just keep going make perfect sense. The band, apparently, had so much fire in its veins that it couldn't even stop itself—at least not right away.  \"],[22692,\"The unifying thread in Gucci Mane’s music since being released from prison this past May after serving nearly three years for drug and gun charges can be summed up in one word: readjustment. His stunning physical transformation—which included losing 75 pounds and the emergence of an enviable six-pack, the results of a healthier drug-free lifestyle—also impacted Gucci’s rapping itself. Aside from the usual sort of rust that needed to be shaken off, his dramatic weight loss affected his delivery in other tangible ways (which only stoked the fires of the clone conspiracy theories): the new Gucci was less congested, less slurred, and less guttural.July’s Everybody Looking felt like an exploratory mission, as if he was unfamiliar with his own voice and testing out his new physical presence for size. Three months later, Woptober followed, which found the prolific Atlanta rapper increasing his familiarity with his vocal register, his rapping tighter and more assured. On The Return of East Atlanta Santa, his final release of 2016, Gucci has caught up with his new normal, sounding fully acclimatized to the new version of himself. No longer is he searching for his footing: on opener “St. Brick Intro” he immediately slips in the pocket of Zaytoven’s funhouse minor-key rework of “Jingle Bells” and paints himself as the trap Kris Kringle: “Middle of the winter, I pull up in a vert \\/ It’s the middle of December, she pulled up in a skirt\\/ Santa Claus of the hood, I pull up with the work \\/ They call me East Atlanta Santa, run up on me, get murked.” Irreverent and silly as hell, the only thing that might prevent it from joining the pantheon of unconventional Christmas bangers is the slightness that comes with acting as an album’s welcome mat.The holiday cheer extends no further, but the album’s remaining twelve tracks benefit from similarly locked-in performances. Whereas Everybody Looking and Woptober mirrored Gucci’s new lifestyle in content as well as form—he opened Everybody Looking by introducing himself as a “recovering drug addict”—here it is reflected in the clarity of his performance. The allusions to cleaner living are mostly oblique. “Last Time” features Travis Scott in support mode—which also happens to be his best mode—and preaches conscientiousness in recreational drug use. It contains some of the few direct references to Gucci’s erratic last decade: “See I’m an ex-X popper and online shopper \\/ Niggas thought I was a clone, they heard me speak proper.” The other nod to his self-destructive past arrives in the chorus of “I Can’t,” one of the stickiest in his post-prison output: “You can talk about homicides, but I can’t.”Gucci himself remains as magnetic as ever. He isn’t overwhelmed when Drake shows up to pull double duty on “Both,” lending his voice to the song's chorus as well as contributing a verse of his own. It’s more successful than the last time the two linked up—“Back on Road” off Everybody Looking—on which a phoned-in Drake hook added little. Gucci’s also still capable of rattling off deceptively poetic turns of phrases like “Now my watch so fucking bright it look like sunlight in the night,” as heard on the Mike WiLL Made-It-produced standout “Nonchalant.” On the same song he raps “In a whip so new, valet scared to park it,” an example of his sense of humor, which doesn't always get enough credit. The Return of East Atlanta Santa leans on this lighter, more playful side of Gucci’s personality, proving along the way that back to business doesn’t have to mean an absence of fun.\"],[22677,\"In director Pablo Larrain’s Jackie, unlike almost any movie made about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, there are no hints of shadowy puppet masters or boogeymen: there is simply the spotlight on one person’s grieving, complicated by the grief of an entire nation. Accompanying the film is a score written by Mica Levi, whose work in film in the last three years is slowly surpassing any of her output as an experimental producer or art-pop rocker (with Micachu and the Shapes). Her score for Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin proved Levi’s ability to create sound that is not only atmospheric, but definitive to the film itself. With the power of an orchestra behind her, Levi provides Jackie a palpitating pulse for the film’s portrait of a seemingly unknowable historical figure.The score introduces itself in the film immediately as Natalie Portman walks through autumnal grounds of the Kennedy compound. She is walking towards her home, to meet a reporter (Theodore H. White, who wrote a LIFE magazine article that largely began the Camelot myth surrounding the Kennedy administration) to discuss life after November 22. The camera zooms in on Portman’s grimace, as she makes her way home, and Levi’s “Intro,” swoops into the scene with ghostly strings, immediately setting a tone of melancholy. Throughout the film, Levi’s score is used sparingly, but with sensitive accuracy. Here in these first few minutes of the film, it gives weight to all the dead foliage. The camera often lingers on Portman’s face, especially when she is looking in the mirror. In moments like these, Levi’s score emerges unexpectedly, giving a strange stability to these often frayed and vulnerable visual experiences. One moment in particular haunted me. Shortly after the assassination, Portman finds herself in the bathroom of Air Force One, right before LBJ is sworn in as president. She looks in the mirror, wiping away blood from her face and blouse. When Portman cleans the viscera off the mirror, smudging its surface and blurring away her image, the piece “Tears,” which was barely perceptible as a nervous string arrangement at the beginning of the scene asserts itself. A simple chord progression of keys gives a momentary balm, and frames the scene perfectly. Jackie is replete with visual moments like this one, that are painful to look at. What Levi’s music can do is provide a brief respite, smoothing the razor edges of a picture. And unlike her work in Under the Skin, Levi’s score in Jackie is unobtrusive, it exists when you need and want it to, providing either a relief from or a multiplication of the grief the film is relating. Listening to the whole score removed from the film, it’s easy to spot the same sounds used over and over again. At times, these leitmotifs can seem uninteresting when stretched out into compositions. But when you revisit them, there is a puncturing sensation to these repetitions. One theme in particular: a swell of descending strings that mimic the action of exhaling a very deep breath, is quite affecting. It appears in the introductory song, as well as in “Lee Harvey Oswald” (a piece used during the assassination scene) and “Walk to the Capitol” (which that soundtracks the funeral procession). In these parts of the film, the regular reaction might be to hold your breath, while processing the overwhelming sadness. But, what Levi’s score can do, is give the film and the viewer a way to stabilize a reaction; the strings allow you to feel oxygen in the room.As a piece of music alone, it is hard to separate Levi’s compositions from their pragmatic function as a score. When revisiting the score weeks after watching the movie, the effect of certain sounds and movements was apparitional, the film’s power lingering essentially because Levi’s sonic cues were so well-wrought. Without her work the film might be less complete. Like an solid frame to a complex painting, Levi’s score concretizes and helps control the artistic experience of the film. In effect, the score may not supersede its filmic anchor, but is sure does make the entire endeavor more beautiful. \"],[22469,\"Scott Mescudi does not make small projects. His shortest album, Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon, runs 41 minutes, and last year, he somehow wrung over 91 minutes out of the psychedelic acoustic Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven. Grandiosity is part of Kid Cudi’s charm: His world is melodramatic and vast while remaining entrenched in his most personal memories. While his issues are his own (and typically petty), he conveys them as important, as if they fit into a larger universal scheme where things have meaning and happen for a reason. In 2009, he slowly opened the doors to that world, hum-singing “Welcome\\/You’re in my dreams” on Man on the Moon’s intro. His latest tome, the 87-minute Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin’, continues that tradition. It’s expansive, and Cudi is as focused as he’s been since 2010’s Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. But it also comes with the same drawbacks that have plagued the Cleveland artist throughout his career: His albums require full immersion and acceptance of his worldview to function, but it’s still not clear that he has found something new (or anything at all) to say that makes him a unique voice worth hearing.To start his career, Cudi flaunted his vulnerabilities, endearing him to fans who went through similar troubles. By MOTM II, he took on a more advisory role, calmly offering, “I am your big brother” on “Revofev.” When martyrdom proved fruitless and thankless, he got lost in those troubles, and preferred to steer negative: “You doubt him, don’t know a damn thing about him\\/What is hip-hop without him,” from Indicud’s “King Wizard.” On Passion, Pain & Demon Slayin’, Cudi has returned to the Man on the Moon attitudes, where he is the pained and wizened sad sack—at once able to offer comfort and vulnerable to his own destructive tendencies.“Swim in the Light,” for instance, is truly affecting, a sort of meditative moment of ambient hip-hop. The minimalist offering conjures deeper images and feeling buried deep within the track; “you could try and numb the pain, but it’ll never go away,” he advises. But when he tries to expound, as on “Wounds,” he finds himself mired in cliché, suggesting you “dig deeper” to find yourself. It’s a constant theme in Cudi’s work; his songs might feel important, but since he only operates in tired symbolism, does he have anything worth saying? Little on Passion convinces that Cudi is a greater authority on the ways of the world than he’s been before, but growth is not as much a part of his repertoire as the frequent suggestions of ascension would lead you to believe. Like he states on “Swim in the Light,” the problems don’t disappear, so a Cudi experience is simply finding new warm atmospheres to bask in the darkness.Lyrics have been Cudi’s most frequent struggle. The closing “Surfin’” is a very catchy song that excels on its hook alone, but Cudi finds great difficulty in biding his time between choruses. Forced to say something in the interim, he comes up with “The industry is so full of shit\\/Welcome, y’all, to the enema.” He’s barely ever been a rapper, which made him more unique and interesting when end rhymes and pacing were of little concern to him.As usual with his music, Passion’s best moments come from its production. Cudi brought back his career-launching accomplice Plain Pat, and recruited Kanye soothsayer Mike Dean, which lends cohesion and focus to the record. Regardless of its dull content, “Frequency” sounds vibrant, thanks to an instrumental that marries the ambition of Man on the Moon with the spacey calmness of Satellite Flight. The Pat-produced “Dance 4 Eternity” feature beautiful synths that hum around the background with skittering hi-hats that drive the song. And “The Guide” is a menacing whirl, enlivened by an André 3000 verse. At its worst, however, too much of the album blends together—“Kitchen” and “Cosmic Warrior” may as well be the same song. The same goes for “Distant Fantasies,” “Wounds,” and “Mature Nature.” At this point in his firmly established career, Kid Cudi does not wish to be a savior, and he is less interested in being a brat, as Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven allowed him an outlet to lash out against himself and others. The meaning of his music has gone entirely internal, with the listener left to search for the “Frequency” on Cudi’s terms and in his realm. The 87-minute runtime is both ridiculous and somehow necessary; if the redundancies were cut, some of the self-importance would be lost. The extended monotony allows you to get lost in Cudi’s ego and your own head, clearing room amid the nothingness to discover and create meaning.\"],[22711,\"When something gets tagged as nerdcore rap, the implications are clear: this is for the Star Wars diehards, the sub-Redditors worried about the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s continuity with canon, or as Alex Trebek once put it on “Jeopardy!,” “losers.” It’s less MF Doom coolly retconning a comic supervillain into an enigmatic rap persona, and more Childish Gambino’s “Freaks and Geeks.” Nerdcore rap evokes the awkward and gangly, completely at odds with traditional rap bravado but still unknowingly, clumsily pantomiming its gestures nonetheless. To a point, it has long been insinuated that nerdcore rap is mostly just a safe space for introverted white males to write artlessly hypertechnical verses of Guardians of the Galaxy fan fiction and the like.Enter Sammus, a Cornell PhD student and rapper\\/producer named for the Metroid heroine, making what she calls “black girl nerd rap.” Her strongest work to date is Pieces in Space, a weird and confessional collection of songs about being weird and confessional. Sammus’ music represents an under-reached subset of geek fandom: it’s made for black feminists trying to quietly coexist in the gaming and comic subcultures. But as the recent GamerGate scandal proved, this can be a culture of sexism and anti-progressivism, and it exists within a larger world that already belittles and diminishes black women specifically. Sammus’ writing converges at the intersection of race, womanhood, sexuality, and nerdiness, doing so with a subtlety lost on most in the subgenre, who rap like they’re mashing every button on a controller at once to do a combo. She’s just as influenced by hardcore nerdcore trailblazer Mega Ran as she is Kanye West. Sammus is a passionate idealist and craft-first poet, penning the kind of wordy marvels that rap annotator types fawn over; she is self-described as “living in the land of keystrokes and passwords\\/Cheat codes, amiibos, and actors.”On the surface, the reference points for Pieces in Space are obvious and in keeping with the subgenre’s framework, dealing primarily with characters in the geek lexicon: MMOs, Nintendo, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Sega with mentions of Loki, Luke Cage, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Lakitu, and Majin Buu. But a closer reading reveals understated and sharp critiques about the ways we relate in the digital age, and how they often rob us of true connection. In the margins, these themes continuously arise: Talking to Siri when no one will listen, sharing a Netflix account with an ex you never talk to, being attacked by anonymous lynch mobs of trolls and fire-starters in comment sections. It documents life online as a black female gamer, and in turn reveals how the internet is dehumanizing us.On “Comments Disabled,” a tightly-coiled chronicle about the pervasively toxic and antagonistic internet culture that now extends all the way to the White House, Sammus dismantles trolls. “I’m thinking you should invest in collecting a best friend,” she raps, “Who won’t let you press send\\/To someone you just met\\/Through Twitter or Sirius XM.” On “Perfect Dark,” she examines the lack of women of color in comics, games, and anime, sending a simple message: black girls want to have heroes, too. Alongside Jean Grae (a skilled lyricist who herself is named after a comic hero), “1080p” finds Sammus writing about the hardships of balancing grad school, an indie rap career, and interpersonal relationships when trying to communicate emotions through phone and computer screens, an idea fittingly conveyed by the concept of seeing things in higher resolution.What unfolds in Pieces in Space is a tale of personal identity and perspective that provides interesting insights on micro and macro scales. Sammus paints a complete and complex self-portrait while exposing truths about the subculture she wades through, and the greater world at large. She’s a ferocious and thoughtful MC whose flows call to mind the solving of a Rubik’s Cube, especially on songs like “Headliner” and “Genius.” Her hooks can leave something to be desired; they’re usually too long-winded and chewy to be earworms, sticking out like sore thumbs. But at any given moment, she’s liable to rattle off a bar like “Gotta spit so sick that you drain Big Pharma\\/Get your skin so thick you don’t get stigmata” on “Cubicle.” She’s as likely to rap about phosphates and integers as she is to name-check Serena Williams or Emmitt Till. Her delivery is piercing, her perspective refreshing. She ends up becoming the role model she once set out to find.\"],[22678,\"Technically, Fireplace: TheNotTheOtherSide is the debut solo album from Hodgy (née Beats). The Odd Future co-founder has been in the public eye, however, for over half a decade. He’s released six solo mixtapes and EPs, five projects with MellowHype, MellowHigh, and been prominently featured on all three OF group efforts—not to mention the “Sandwitches” verse that landed him on national TV. Still, there’s typically a reason why a rapper calls something an album after years of mixtapes. Even if the distinction is increasingly meaningless, as Drake and Chance the Rapper have both scored Grammy nominations off of releases they insist are “mixtapes,” the implication remains that the “album” is a statement piece. In addition, going solo allows an artist to explore sounds and themes that may not fit into a group’s more established aesthetic—even if Hodgy was the lone MC in MellowHype. In both regards, Hodgy offers nothing new on Fireplace, and brings into question what he offers as an artist with MellowHype dormant and the more powerful collective dissolved.Right off the bat, Hodgy struggles to distance himself from Odd Future. After a brief intro, the first rapper to deliver on the record is Salomon Faye. It’s a move that will instantly ring a bell for OF loyalists—the widest audience for a 2016 Hodgy release—as it’s the same one Earl Sweatshirt pulled on his own debut, Doris, when the shy and sly Sweatshirt let non-rapper SK La’ Flare open his comeback record in one last effort to delay his triumphant return from Samoa. Regardless of intent, Hodgy’s decision to wait his turn on “Kundalini” is a misfire, as he and Faye share tone, pace, and message, making them virtually indistinguishable. There is no contrast or aha moment, just confusion as to why Hodgy would not want to set the tone for his first real album.Non-distinction plagues much of Fireplace. With MellowHype, Hodgy leaned on Left Brain to create the mood. With Left ensuring a consistent vibe, Hodgy was free to express himself with more creative lyrics that rarely explored much, but had great energy. Fireplace lacks any semblance of cohesion in production, which leads to a survey of generic rap beats that ranges from a Clams Casino copycat cut like “Resurrection” to the chopped-up soul of the Knxwledge-produced “Dreaminofthinkin,” which does not fit Hodgy. There is nothing to ground Hodgy on the record, and very few of the instrumentals catch the ear, despite collaborations with big names, like Unknown Mortal Orchestra, BADBADNOTGOOD, Knx, and 88-Keys.Without interesting beats, or at least ones that fit a defined aesthetic, all that’s left is Hodgy’s lyrical ability. To start his career, Hodgy’s greatest asset was that he was not Tyler, the Creator. He could have fun while his comrades screamed vilely, but no longer are they rambunctious teens, and lines like “I’m just like Mike, Mike-WiLL, Miley Cyrus,” and “I’m observing like I’m the fly on the wall, nigga, Pink Floyd” are just bad. The latter is on a track with Busta Rhymes, who upstages Hodgy even while on cruise control, just by varying his flow and delivery. Throughout Fireplace, Hodgy is stuck somewhere among being a punchline rapper, a storyteller, and a moralist. On “They Want,” he raps about institutional racism, and on the closing “DYSLM,” he fights to win back the mother of his son. Otherwise, he does not maintain a consistent message throughout a track, nor does he connect ideas throughout the album. On “Glory,” for example, he declares, “The brightest light my future,” but by “The Now,” he intones, “Don’t be waiting around, go get it time is now.” There are no developments between the two moments that indicate a change in perspective: They remain empty cliches.The only discernible advancement on Fireplace is Hodgy’s continued growth as a singer. It’s a skill he began to flex in earnest on his 2016 mixtapes They Watchin Lofi Series 1 and Dukkha, and it’s quickly become his most pleasant trait. Unfortunately, although no fault of his own, he sounds exactly like Frank Ocean circa Nostalgia, Ultra., and the Odd Future connection certainly doesn’t help in distancing the two. Hodgy’s singing allows him to handle hook duties on his own, but it also amplifies how bad some of the rapping is (“I’ve learned that ball is life, and I’m the goalie” on “Laguna”), knowing he could do so much more with less just by using his own abilities.Fireplace is not even Hodgy’s first release on a major label. MellowHype’s Numbers, MellowHigh, and The OF Tape Vol. 2 all came out on Odd Future’s Sony imprint; even BlackenedWhite got a reissue via Fat Possum. After six attempts and years after the collective’s cultural peak, it’s not clear what made Fireplace the project worth declaring Hodgy’s official debut. The record lacks consistent themes and any set of beliefs beyond scattered attempts at positivity. Musically, it is hardly satisfying, as the fleeting enjoyable moments are swallowed up by a great deal of frustrating mediocrity. Fireplace: TheNotTheOtherSide does not give depth to Hodgy, does not answer why he’s any different now that he’s Beats-less, does not prove that he’s capable of carrying a project on his own. It’s disappointing, considering the potential he showed as a fiery young rapper, but that feeling is perhaps the same reason why Fireplace even exists. Hodgy is a rapper you once knew, and he’s still here for better, but mostly, for worse.\"],[22664,\"What does the concept “slight freedom” mean when you’re a musician like Jeff Parker? Is the qualifier tongue-in-cheek? It’s not like he must hear the word “no” very much. Since the 1990s, as a linchpin of Chicago’s music scene, Parker has developed his singular voice across a variety of contexts. He’s a core member of Tortoise, where his playing often feels like the glue that holds the band together; as a co-founder of the Tortoise spin-off Isotope 217, he tackles looser, spongier strains of jazz-funk. Then there are his sideman gigs—for Toumani Diabaté, Matana Roberts, Meshell Ndegeocello, among many others—and his activities in a number of more traditional jazz ensembles, including his long-running trio with bassist Chris Lopes and drummer Chad Taylor.Even as a frontman, though, Parker is a stealthy player, not a limelight-hugger; he’s known for his restraint and his carefully controlled tone. His uncluttered playing seems to hew to the tenets of Marie Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: “Discard anything that doesn’t spark joy.”This past year has seen Parker moving outward, in multiple directions—filigreeing the edges of Tortoise’s sly, energetic comeback, The Catastrophist; exploring tangled textures and timbres alongside cornetist Rob Mazurek on the album Some Jellyfish Live Forever; and rolling up a decade’s worth of beat sketches on The New Breed, a laid-back set of soul-jazz experiments colored by his recent move to Los Angeles.With Slight Freedom, he tries something new yet again. Unlike The New Breed, where a handful of collaborators helped execute his ideas, Slight Freedom, his first totally solo album, is all Parker. He recorded everything live in the studio with no overdubs, using a Boomerang Phrase Sampler to layer loops and drones in real time. But where some users of looping pedals are prone to building up towering stacks of tone, Parker’s restraint still prevails. He constructs the title track like a spider spinning its web: Using a dubby, percussive pattern as the main support, he lays down fine, almost invisible fibers—seemingly wispy yet deceptively sturdy—that are more structural than ornamental. There are no wasted motions. Yet the whole, which seems to hang in mid-air, glistening, remains deeply expressive, despite its extreme economy.“Slight Freedom” sets the tone for the whole album. All four songs, including a drowsy instrumental cover of Frank Ocean’s “Super Rich Kids” and a loosely woven instrumental version of Billy Strayhorn’s “Lush Life,” are quiet, atmospheric mood studies that tend to conceal more than they reveal. Sometimes it seems as if Parker is intent upon hiding behind his own shadow: In “Super Rich Kids,” his muted, almost bossa nova-like plucks are nearly obscured by sounds pouring in through an open window: braking buses, car horns, the occasional burst of police siren, terse and menacing. A similar kind of veiling happens on “Lush Life,” in which a dull electrical hum stretches from beginning to end, masking the contours of Parker’s tremolo-soaked guitar with faint dissonance. Parker’s take on the standard is bittersweet, almost resigned; from time to time, the melody reluctantly pokes its head out from beneath the chords, but mostly the song dwells in an all-consuming fog—a perfect evocation of Strayhorn’s hungover and heartbroken narrator, slumped against the bar in some seedy dive.“Mainz,” on the other hand, gives Parker his chance to shine—at least, within the spare framework he has set up for himself. It’s hardly acrobatic, but the song’s unusual time signature, which switchbacks between 13\\/8 and 12\\/8, is as tricky as it is lithe. In his trio’s 2012 recording of the Chad Taylor composition, the band closes out the song by locking into a slow, driving groove, but here he takes a considerably different tack: The song’s final five minutes are just pure, shimmering held tones and softly droning feedback.It turns out that some of the album’s most striking moments are those, like this one, where the least is happening. In the opening “Slight Freedom,” the principal theme is eventually swallowed up into a luminous bath of tone, and for six more minutes he proceeds to gently stir it, eking quiet mini-melodies out of the swirl. It’s not jazz, it’s not ambient, it’s not noise; it’s something more idiosyncratic and more personal, something only Parker could have come up with. Perhaps this is what “slight freedom” is supposed to mean: Not an anarchic exploding of rules, not the total liberation proposed by free jazz, but a steadier, stealthier path—dissolving boundaries, softening constraints, and wearing away at the edges of things until the ideas run as freely as water.\"],[22685,\"“Making a song from alpha to omega is challenging,” A-Trak told Forbes last November. “It's from a song that has already worked in some capacity. You're taking a piece of something that is already catchy at in some way and you are decorating it with your production.” Perceiving the art of the remix as mere decoration might be anathema for its finest practitioners—be they François K., Ricardo Villalobos, or Puff— but in ’00s dance culture, A-Trak’s work and sensibilities served as an amped-up gateway for a new generation. Whether they checked his Soundcloud because of his connection to Kanye, because they loved southern hip-hop but not Ed Banger (or vice versa), or because of festival-friendly remixes of big indie rock acts, A-Trak’s work ethic blurred genre lines. Culling a decade of remixes (with over 180 remix credits to his name), the lavish In the Loop 6x7” box set marks the first time that many of these digital-only remixes have been available in a physical format rather than Beatport-only download. The opening remix of Architecture in Helsinki’s “Heart It Races” (back when A-Trak still used the handle Trizzy) showed that from the start A-Trak had a knack for tearing down the mid-’00s walls between indie rock, mainstream hip-hop and electronic dance music. He takes Neptunes-type drum stutters, adds hip-hop backspins, a touch of steel pan and keeps the noxious yip of vocals intact, yet it all winds up sticking together.Listening to all these remixes at once reveals that A-Trak often tried to please everyone, and his knack for picking over myriad genres often meant he felt the need to shoehorn everything in with each remix opportunity. His remix of Scanners’ “Bombs” is the equivalent of a dogpile: compressed rock guitar stabs, multiple sped-up vocal samples saying “drop,” rave synth swoops, voices minced until they become hiccups and then—why the hell not?—some cowbell dumped on for good measure, as if to make sure every box gets ticked.His remix of Sébastian Tellier’s “Kilometer” seems similarly intent on touching on every trend in French dance music. A-Trak filters the kick down to a muffled throb redolent of “Around the World,” before bringing in a swell of disco symphonic strings and electro squelch, ranging from Ed Banger filter house to Daft Punk then back to Québécois disco. Similar sensibilities get applied to Phoenix’s “Trying to Be Cool” as he builds the opening keyboard figure into something bombastic. Visit a section of the song that doesn't have Thomas Mars’ telltale voice and one would be hard-pressed to distinguish it from any other track of the past decade.What A-Trak delivers in spades is big, simple pleasures. For Boys Noize’s “Oh!,” he devastates with little more than that titular shout, vocodered growls, dancehall sirens and a feverish beat. He wasn’t the first one to have a go at the Yeah Yeah Yeahs late-period dance move of “Heads Will Roll,” but his remix is undeniable. Jacking up Nick Zinner’s tepid goth synth stabs until it’s brawny enough to fill a Coachella tent, he cuts away the band’s ineffective rock moves and instead replaces it all with leaner electronic components. A-Trak remakes Karen O into an icy electro queen, surrounding her with only the finest fromage: lasers, claps, 303 squelches and gaudy builds.Give him the keys to another Brooklyn dancepunk band though—in this instance the Rapture— and the same tricks don’t pan out. On the piano-house-meets-gospel glory of “How Deep is Your Love,” A-Trak doesn't have the patience to give the song time to unfurl, shortening the song by a third, getting right to the dramatic build and then adding heaps of neon and rave lights. For the remarkable range of artists that In the Loop displays, A-Trak’s ability to mash together different genres and sounds into a crowd-pleasing amalgam also means that—much like a great night out—the distinguishing characteristics blur together into an undifferentiated mass.\"],[22690,\"Native State, the 2014 debut record by Jess Williamson, depicted the Texan singer\\/songwriter’s journey back to her home state from a stint living in NYC, ditching the city and its discomforts for the wide-open country of her heart. Driven largely by banjo and other folksy instruments like dobro and dulcimer, Native State’s sound lumped Williamson into a loose constellation of mournful, folksy musicians, despite the fact that her spindly, spine-tingling voice took her songs in places most of her supposed peers would never dare to go. But Heart Song, Williamson’s sophomore effort, raises the question of how native Native State really was, as it finds her ditching bucolic Americana and returning to a place of urban malaise that feels far more natural for her.What remains unchanged is Williamson’s stunning voice, which remains as compelling and remarkable as it was on Native State. Her rich, lip-curled contralto has an uncanny familiarity to it, hitting a spot somewhere between Cat Power and Angel Olsen, with moments of early Joanna Newsom’s yawp. But the way she wields this voice is unique. On Native State, that voice often seemed set off in opposition to the rustic instrumentation, but on Heart Song everything seems fused together as one.Her writing, while evocative in any setting, feels more suited to these ominous all-night-diner\\/on-the-road soundtracks than to porch-mystic musings. Opener “Say It” captures this transition well, conjuring a quasi-Lynchian vision of a weary, wary woman conversing with a lover: “We could do better than this cheap motel\\/But somehow here I feel the most like myself.” On the slowly unfolding and percussion-less “Snake Song”—which references Will Oldham’s apocalyptic folkie forbearer Palace Brothers with the lyric “There is no one what will take care of you”—Williamson offers the sharp line “I have made friends with those too jealous to let the love come in\\/And I’ll never talk to them again even if I again talk to them.” Each track relies heavily on reverb-soaked electric guitar lines, a stark simplicity that works in tandem with Williamson’s soaring, interrogative voice.The atmosphere on Heart Song is so strong and captivating that it pulls the more experimental moments into the center as well, like the mariachi deathsong closer “Devil’s Girl.” The best first-person storytelling manages to exist both inside and outside of the narrator’s head, a state which Williamson achieves deftly with cleverly written—and most importantly, delivered—lines such as “It’s evil how the best men I know are in and out of hospitals\\/Fighting some devils\\/…. Well maybe I am just the devil’s girl.” “Devil’s Girl” is actually an older song of Williamson’s, but the music been recast for Heart Song, scrapping the previous bluegrass\\/folk trappings in place of something rawer and more emotive.At only seven tracks, Heart Song feels almost too brief. Its ghostly instrumentation and measured pace distort your sense of time in a manner similar to stark classics like Songs: Ohia’s Didn’t It Rain. Williamson has evolved subtly over her two records, and Heart Song lifts her finally and definitely out of the world of “folk” into something deeper, more uncanny, and out-of-time. Heart Song never tires nor loses its tension, as if Williamson’s voice has finally found its proper milieu.\"],[22689,\"Kevin Abstract just happens to rap; in another era, he would have been an endearing alt-rock frontman. Only 20 years old, Abstract is a member of the self-described “All-American Boy Band” BROCKHAMPTON, and he travelled much of his childhood before recently settling out in Los Angeles. American Boyfriend, his sophomore album, holds onto the theme of constant movement as Abstract situates himself in a nameless high school in an unknown city, where he fantasizes about football players. His lyrical specificity is reserved for people: “Showed me obscure bands he was into\\/His mom was in the dining room, we’re in his bedroom,” he raps on “Seventeen,” as he describes afternoons spent with an unrequited crush.  He’s almost old enough to drink, but Abstract’s world here is for kids who are barely old enough to drive. His last project MTV1987 teased out tendrils of post-Odd Future Tumblr rap, harsh production, strained parental relationships, and sexually frustrated lyrics; American Boyfriend removes that youthful angst. He no longer chastises past lovers, but rather turns inwards to investigate what he even wants out of romantic relationships. “Can’t tell my family I’m bi\\/Can’t tell my mother I’m gay\\/The hardest part of my day\\/Is wishing I was fucking straight,” he raps on the album’s centerpiece “Papercut.” Where MTV1987 spoke down to women, the boys on American Boyfriend open Abstract’s eyes to new worlds and sides of himself. Only a year between projects, Abstract’s music is now imbued with a freeness and warmth that was previously only hinted at in his music.Michael Uzowuru, an executive producer on American Boyfriend, who also worked on Frank Ocean’s Blonde (“Nights”) and Endless (“Rushes To”), helped bring Ocean’s genre-blurred vision to Abstract’s work. But, where Frank’s ideas languorously stretched the boundaries of traditional pop songwriting, Abstract’s are more frantic. At 16 tracks long and clocking under under 40 minutes, the album still dips into a few too many ideas. “Suburban Born” and “Runner” meander needlessly, where the wistful acoustic guitar and falsetto of the angelic “Yellow” speak to the same struggle of opposite poles of self-confidence and self-doubt. That moment, along with “American Boyfriend,” inches towards a Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness B-side territory. He doesn’t reach Billy Corgan’s dramatics, but it is encouraging to watch him reach.Two years ago, Abstract wrote an open letter to Childish Gambino, where he described himself as “too black for the whites and too white for the blacks.” American Boyfriend appears to find Abstract still struggling through those issues of his high school days, as he places himself back inside those hallways and bleachers that made him feel like such an outsider. Even before Glover’s critically beloved TV show “Atlanta” and the surprise funk turn of “Awaken, My Love”, his inward-facing persona offered a direction for black kids like Abstract, who felt too removed from the ego of rap’s biggest stars. Abstract’s myth-building isn’t meant to occupy a stadium tour or a floating stage setup, but instead for the kids alone in class needing something to by another day.  The freedom of abandoning rap’s default confidence stance gives American Boyfriend an almost twee preciousness, Abstract isn’t afraid to swim freely in his emotions. On “Miserable America,” Abstract speaks about his mother’s homophobia and the racism of his boyfriend’s parents, as he mournfully observes, “They love gays, but they hate niggas.” Even in the familial and romantic relationships that should provide comfort, Abstract instead finds irresolvable identity conflicts. American Boyfriend can feel a bit scattered and unsure, but it’s an album seeking love in a world now primed to find new angles for hate. For that reason alone, it feels welcome. \"],[22697,\"As half of Gatekeeper, Aaron David Ross produced dizzying, over-the-top synth experiments, full of conceptual knots. His 2015 solo release under the name ADR was similarly dense, an exploration of life within networks that mimicked the spiraling disjunct of online life. With THROAT, he delivers something more distilled. Maybe the most conventionally listenable release of his career, its smoother productions serve as subtler—even insidious—vehicles for his ideas about communication and mediation.The conceptual twist here is that the album is composed of vocal samples, most scrubbed clean of any signifiers of human origin. Remembering this as you listen can be amusing, even creepy, and the overall effect is that of a futuristic gloss, each sourced note subsumed into a larger whole. Ross has built these abstract fragments into all-but-seamless collages that climb, flutter, and drop in accordance with the rules of pop songwriting, but what’s constructed here has no singular voice, no characters, no storytelling—indeed, no language, at least not in the traditional sense, though occasionally a voice will float out in an unintelligible lead. Still, these tracks brim with feeling, or feeling’s synthetic analog.Where his previous work tended to assault the listener, here there’s a sense of being swept up or carried—a more elegant transaction, but still one that requires the listener to cede power. On opener “Every Node,” Ross weaves bubbly melodies into a hopeful chorus, developing into a sort of call-and-response over a whispered R&B beat; “Lost Ya” supplements a bassline full of chipper indifference with wistful pitched-up interludes. Musically, the effect isn’t so far off from the high-definition, high-anxiety likes of Holly Herndon, Katie Gately, or, dare I say, PC Music—music that strives to sound ultra-contemporary. Especially within this focused palette, Ross’ hyper-detailed approach to composition comes into crystalline focus. As pop producers do, he’s plumbing and deploying an array of styles here, from classical choral arrangements to polyrhythms to, on “King David,” what sounds like a muddled take on the “Ha Dance” break. But he’s also a student of a certain breed of outsized radio-EDM; Jack Ü comes to mind. The implication is that while such music succeeds because of how intensely legible it feels, this belies a dangerous lack of genuine content to communicate.Ross’s project might be dystopian at its core, revealing us to be floating a little too comfortably in the cybermuck that builds up invisibly between sender and receiver. But his choruses still speak, in their own strange and affecting ways—I think, for example, of the plaintive solemnity of “Advice,” or “Effort,” in which danceable ambivalence gives way to a sample that’s been blown out into a cathartic machine scream, not unlike something you’d hear in a Linkin Park song. The structures of communication twist and splinter, but we can still sense a constant longing.\"],[22681,\"There aren’t many electronic dance musicians more cantankerous than deadmau5. His beefs are legion, his tweetstorms legendary. And the scrawny, tattooed Torontonian’s self-loathing is nearly as famous as his short fuse. Sometimes, the self-deprecating potshots—making fun of his own costume, admitting that most EDM performances are pure pantomime—scan as refreshingly down-to-earth takes on an industry full of metastasized egos and virtually no self-awareness. But sometimes, his snark takes a darker tone. Just a year ago, he threatened that he was thinking about “killing off” the deadmau5 “bullshit” and starting over. “fuck it. why not,” he tweeted, sounding not unlike a man standing on the railing of a bridge.But where many neurotic artists’ work actively benefits from their neuroses, the same can’t necessarily be said of deadmau5, aka Joel Zimmerman. His music isn’t without its strengths: It can be catchy and immersive, and it’s remarkably well-engineered, packed with satisfying oomph and spine-tingling timbres. And for all the shit that deadmau5 has gotten for being, well, deadmau5, his music has often been markedly less corny than 99% of mainstream EDM. The best deadmau5 tracks burrow into the kind of long, dark groove that has characterized four-to-the-floor dance music since the very beginning; for listeners, they’re more about losing yourself in the beat than gawking at the bozo onstage. (That’s ironic, given his mouse-head gimmick.) Nevertheless, his music tends to be relatively uncomplicated, conflict- and friction-free—in short, far more polite that you’d expect from a guy who smokes like a chimney, swears like a sailor, and, you know, wears a gigantic, light-up cartoon mouse head on stage.Perhaps it’s this disconnect between his music and his persona that led deadmau5 to trash his latest album upon its release. “i don’t even like it,” he tweeted. “it was like... so fucking rushed \\/ slapped together.” Later, despite “orders from above” not to bad-mouth his own work, he explained to Rolling Stone that it wasn’t written “from start to finish; it’s over a year’s worth of work that doesn’t correlate. It's not The fucking Wall!” (Remarkably, this isn’t the first time he’s criticized one of his own records in almost identical language. Of 2012’s >album title goes here<, he lamented the fact that his “tour-heavy year” had stood in the way of him sitting down and making something “from start to finish like The Wall.”)Still, the album isn’t without its pleasures. The opening “4ware” is wistful and driving, with a pinging lead reminiscent of Eric Prydz or Gui Boratto’s progressive trance. The nu-disco number “Cat Thruster” manages the perfect balance of slouching cool and giddy kitsch, playing legato synth riffs and ersatz electric bass off harp flourishes and clever chord changes; if someone told you it was a new Todd Terje tune, you probably wouldn’t bat an eye. And the grinding “Deus Ex Machina” sounds a lot like the kind of gravelly, psychedelic techno that Robag Wruhme and the Wighnomy Brothers used to be known for.Some songs are more lackluster. Both “2448” and “No Problem” tear pages from the Daft Punk playbook, but the former wastes a perfectly good synth riff on a formulaic big-room stomp whose slow rise in pitch mimics a trick he already tried on 2010’s “Bad Selection,” while the heavy-handed touch of the latter tune makes Justice’s most lunkheaded jams look like surgical implements. And the unrequited-love song “Let Go” aims for bittersweet release, but it gets hung up on the earnest-yet-anodyne vocals of the young singer and producer Grabbitz. Even on some of the stronger tracks, Zimmerman seems to be going through the motions. His synthesizers have never sounded richer, but once introduced, his sounds don’t morph and his themes don’t evolve; loops simply loop, unvarying and uninflected, and once a track gets through its obligatory mid-way breakdown, there's really no point in sticking around for three or four minutes of reprise. His drums, meanwhile, favor cleanliness over character; the disco-leaning “Cat Thruster” has more to do with abstract ideas of disco than the music’s actual essence.What’s most frustrating is that Zimmerman clearly has it in him to make a better, more exciting record. “Glish,” a three-way merger between IDM, digi-dub, and skweee, could pass for Aphex Twin, and “Snowcone” is a perfectly serviceable Boards of Canada tribute—not a goal in and of itself, necessarily, but at least a stepping stone toward greener pastures. Best of all is “Whelk Then,” which mixes thundering breakbeats and glistening synths until they swirl like the interior of a snowglobe. Finally, here on the album’s penultimate cut—it would have made for a killer close if they hadn't tacked on an unnecessary, 12-minute edit of “Let Go”—we’re given a sense of what one suspects Zimmerman really wants to do. So why isn’t he doing it? What's strange about W:\\/2016ALBUM\\/ is that it’s Zimmerman's first album since buying himself out of his contract with EMI; in theory, that means he should finally be beholden to no one but himself. Yet he still sounds like he’s hemmed in by others’ expectations of what deadmau5 is supposed to deliver, and who deadmau5 is supposed to be. Maybe it really is time for him to build a better mousetrap once and for all, and see what happens next. \"],[22698,\"To cap off a busy 2016, in which she released and toured behind her sophomore effort Oh No, Jessy Lanza dropped the Oh No No No Remixes EP. On Oh No, co-produced with label mate Jeremy Greenspan of Junior Boys, Lanza explored a breadth of genres from pop to new wave on the way to establishing her own neatly curated sound—one that thrives in the overlap between electronica and R&B. She explored the angst of romantic entanglement usually associated with the latter genre, but her penchant for vibrant synthpop melodies and stuttering drum patterns transformed anguish into a danceable incentive.  Just as it says on the tin, this EP puts a new spin on three tracks from the album: “I Talk BB,” “Could B U,” and “Going Somewhere.” The remixes come courtesy of former collaborators and tourmates DJ Taye and DJ Spinn of Chicago footwork crew Teklife, Morgan Geist aka Storm Queen, and Leon Smart as DVA [Hi:Emotions].While Oh No leaned into the chaotic musings about a budding romance, the EP soundtracks the left-brain, logical analysis. Geist adds a light touch to “I Talk BB,” brightening up the album version with synths and a drum machine. Lanza’s breathy falsetto from the original serves as an instrument on the remix, blending in with the beat rather than standing apart. This holds true when “Could Be U,” the ambient outro to Oh No, is given the Teklife treatment by DJs Taye and Spinn. There are brief hints of Lanza’s voice over a subdued but frenetic drum pattern, which is similar in tone to the original despite the slight increase in tempo, but it seems like she’s not necessarily the star of her own EP. The remixes don’t pounce at the chance to celebrate the upper reaches of her voice—used often, instead of the modal register, to express uncertainty and anxiety on the originals.This point is hammered home on the final track, DVA [Hi:Emotions]’ take on “Going Somewhere,” one of the more upbeat compositions on Oh No that also highlights Lanza’s range, removes her vocal almost entirely. For seven and a half minutes, the track plays out like the audio from some kind of immersive art installation, interpolating snippets of Kim Kardashian’s voice with haunting synth lines and R2-D2-esque droid sounds that mimic most reality shows' warped relationship with the truth (“I just wanna impress you,” Lanza repeats, a relatable impulse that can turn psychotic if it becomes a compulsion).The Oh No No No Remixes EP makes for good ambiance, but they don't say much on their own. They set a relaxed mood, and they function as a mellow, cohesive mini-supplement to the album. But the EP is more of a showcase for Lanza’s collaborators and less a celebration of her voice and everything that made Oh No so good. It’s likely that fans of the latter record, where her songwriting and vocal talent take center stage, will stick with it instead.\"],[22684,\"Composer Peter Broderick has spent the past ten years crafting consistently strong post-classical music, but on last August’s piano-only Partners he seemed to uncover a new gravitas and substance in his limpid, clear language. The inherent challenge with producing minimalistic music is figuring out how to infuse humanity and new ideas into work with only a handful of notes, and to avoid a reliance on vacant “prettiness.” On Partners, Broderick’s music remained stirring and evocative, but there was something new in it: a deeper injection of his personality, and a larger sense of how that plays into his relationship with his own compositions. Now, just a few months later, he returns with follow-up EP Grunewald, but rather than continue to expand on Partners’ developments, it sees him returning to the less vital, more ephemeral work of his past.To be clear, Grunewald is less of a regression for Broderick than an amiable walk down memory lane. This graceful-but-slight release collects five tracks previously issued across two discs (one Japanese, one Taiwanese) that were taken from a single day’s live recording in Berlin. Grunewald takes its name from a beloved local church which functioned as a hub for other Berlin-based experimentalists from the Erased Tapes label constellation like Nils Frahm, seeming to provide inspiration for all those who passed its door, including Broderick here. As a result, Grunewald is Broderick’s way of marking the importance of both the place and time in the lives of him and the other musicians who’ve been impacted by it.  Like Partners, Grunewald is an entirely solo effort, featuring Broderick unaccompanied on piano, violin, and—on the opener “Goodnight”—a bit of vocals. Broderick’s use of his voice on Partners provided one of that album’s highlights, an arresting cover of Irish folk singer Brigid Mae Power’s “Sometimes.” On “Goodnight,” one of four piano-only numbers, he doesn’t quite sing as much as moan and coo on top of slow, plaintively struck chords. Broderick’s instincts for when to use vocals to enrich his minimalist performances are strong—sometimes he will even drop in a snippet of conversational speech, such as on Partners’ “Sometimes.” But the instrumentation of “Goodnight” is so bare and simple as to make it a trivial confection, more ambience than song. “Violin Solo, No. 1,” positioned as the middle of five tracks, provides another nice textural break amidst the four piano tracks, but is no more than advertised—a nice and brief minor key solo on violin.The dark-night journey “Low Light” and the reflective “Eyes Closed and Traveling” offer entrancing melodies and more depth than “Goodnight,” but Grunewald’s clear highlight is “It’s a Storm When I Sleep.” Buoyed by Broderick’s thundering take on Alberti-style bass, he produces a cacophonous-yet-soothing drone that carries on for nearly eight minutes. A shorter version would have been interesting on its own, but stretched out here, it becomes formidable, challenging, and meditative. Though marooned amidst the lighter pieces here, it is suggestive of some of the new directions Broderick would take in making the leap from “pretty” to “profound.”\"],[22693,\"Dawn of Midi’s 2013 album Dysnomia merged genres with ease. Members of modern jazz, contemporary classical, and electronic scenes all celebrated the trio’s memorable grooves and motifs. The exuberance of experimental dance music was easy to identify in this acoustic group’s sound. But another quality of that debut recording was its sense of control, particularly when dealing with ambient aesthetics.Since 2013, the group’s drummer, Qasim Naqvi, has continued to work in the contemporary classical sphere. On the NNA Tapes imprint, he released a set of chamber music (performed by a student ensemble). On his latest EP, he plays and composes on a vintage Moog synthesizer—an instrument similar to the one used by Wendy Carlos on the landmark 1968 LP Switched-on Bach. Taken individually, the six pieces on Chronology dispense small-scale hits of gorgeousness. In tandem, the tracks cohere to form a compelling suite of pieces that can subtly undermine expectations for ambient-influenced composition. Since this early Moog model was a monophonic synthesizer, capable of producing just a single melodic line at any given time, Naqvi had to multitrack his chords and harmonic designs. But this is done so subtly, the tracks all retain the feel of an intimate performance; it’s as though everything was triggered in one ruminative take.On the opener, “Kindly Static,” Naqvi loops a single Moog tone. He turns this into an affecting minimalist composition by switching up playback speeds. Each droning note creates a new equilibrium, while the often slow pitch-bends in between carry a more reluctant, vulnerable feel. On the title track—the longest piece, which serves as the album’s emotional climax—Naqvi layers the sonic information in performances that employ different oscillators. Sometimes this results in a mellow, church-organ feel; at other points, harsher combinations provide a dramatic edge. It’s a slow-moving piece, but rich with activity.Though it isn’t beat-focused, Chronology also has a connection with trends in electronic music that informed Dysnomia. On “Aftertouched,” another piece that uses multichannel playback trickery, Naqvi creates unpredictable rhythmic patterns from consistent harmonies. Because this particular Moog instrument was (in the composer’s words) “kind of janky,” there are stretches where you can hear signal noise in the mix, or else tones that seem less stable than others. But there’s nothing haphazard about the finished product. In “Head Within a Head,” the use of deep, floor-rattling blips works well alongside the instrument’s eccentricities. And the tone clusters that drive “Mt. Erased” have a chattering, jittery air. It’s the contrast between these pieces and the more tranquil compositions that gives Chronology its range—and its sense of purpose.\"],[22686,\"“White Iverson” is not a foundational brick; it is a sandcastle on a windy day with a high tide. No one who appreciated the breezy distraction of a radio song in 2015 wanted to hear nearly 70 minutes of Post Malone a year later. There are new one-hit wonders to enjoy; there are pop icons making important works; there’s probably a book somewhere worth reading.The song was charming, though: Through the haze of its production and Post Malone’s slurred delivery was a certain nostalgic desire and childlike wonder. Somehow, he hopped on a tour with Justin Bieber, and Universal subsidiary Republic Records believed that Stoney, a 68-minute long dirge, was the correct use of his talents. Even if you liked “White Iverson,” was there anyone who thought to themselves, I want to hear this guy’s story! What’s he all about? We need to know more!? For all of Stoney’s faults, its most damning one poisons the record at the source: This thing is completely soulless.It’s not for a lack of trying, however—Post Malone (real name: Austin Post) is presenting his most authentic self here, talking openly about relationships and taking too many drugs and drinking a little too much, amidst numerous “we made it” anthems. But he’s simply not a compelling artist; he doesn’t say anything new about these struggles, doesn’t frame them in a particularly memorable way, and has nothing to say now that he’s wrestled with his fame. What pushes Stoney past being merely forgettable and into a kind of cynical, punishing listen is the access to a bunch of producers and songwriters that came together behind the 21 year old to ensure a product so highly polished, and so clearly connect-the-dots, it robs him of any trace of charm. The album ends up doubling as a tacit acknowledgment that, hey, maybe this guy is just not that interesting.If it’s lowlights you want, Stoney’s got them: “I Fall Apart” brutally crashes the party, appearing right after “White Iverson.” The song is full of acoustic guitars, and features Post’s most obnoxious crutch: that weird little vibrato thing he does, a vain attempt to convey emotion. “I Fall Apart,” a self-lacerating breakup anthem, recalls Staind, working that same woe-is-me white boy pain with an unpleasant voice slathered all over it. “Go Flex” boasts a foot-stomp chorus and enough echo to sound exactly like the Lumineers or any other faceless “whoa-oh-oh” band; it’s as unholy as it sounds on paper.Stoney indulges in a few huge, expertly written, admittedly catchy hooks, but since Post doesn’t have a strong voice and is usually not saying much more than cliches, many of these faux-triumphant songs sound tailor-made for headphone commercials. See: “Congratulations,” with a “let me collect this check” Quavo appearance, or “Too Young,” a song that’s probably about a year old, and already in line to appear on the soundtrack for the next movie about a white boxer.To its credit, Stoney lets its best run of songs loose near the beginning of the album, after turgid opener “Broken Whiskey Glass.” “Big Lie” has a nice, booming DJ Mustard beat, sounding like something that could’ve been on ANTI or SremmLife 2, and one of the record’s strongest hooks, mostly because it plays into the same kind of sleepy-eyed charm of “White Iverson.” The baroque beats on songs like “Déjà Vu,” with Justin Bieber, and the Pharrell-assisted “Up There,” are begging for someone with a little more humor to show up, maybe Young Thug or any of the under-21 Atlanta guys. Still, Post Malone finds those grooves nicely, and they are the least burdensome songs on the record.I have a perhaps wishfully optimistic hope that Stoney could mark the end of a specific kind of rap album: the spiffy cash-in after the viral hit or mixtape run. Post feels like the flimsiest artist yet to get this treatment, and he got such an extravagant treatment at that. With a recent era of mixtape rappers on the decline, along with the steady hemorrhaging of album sales and bigger names taking bigger risks, it seems as if this type of hollow release could soon become as anachronistic as an $18 CD is today.\"],[22643,\"Put on nearly any of the 36 discs in Bob Dylan’s The 1966 Live Recordings box set and it will probably be perfect. Capturing the songwriter at the crest of his magical ’60s peak and culminating with a series of exhilarating performances in Manchester, Paris, and London, the imposing block of music documents Dylan facing down confrontational audiences while making some of the most ambitious creative leaps of his career. Causing controversy in some quarters by playing electric guitar in front of a rock band and seemingly abandoning his topical political songwriting, the shows depict an ongoing battle between Dylan and self-righteously betrayed folkies. Debuting material from the not-yet-released Blonde on Blonde alongside recent hits and new electrified arrangements of old tunes, Dylan is luminous and fragile-sounding during his opening solo acoustic sets, and equally fierce and possessed during the electric second halves, backed by the quintet that would soon become the Band, who match him in super-charged vitality. A classic tour from start to finish, the set’s only drawbacks owe more to the format than the music: Various incomplete or missing songs, a few over-saturated vocal tracks, five CDs worth of grotty audience tapes, and the fact that Dylan performs nearly the same set lists in nearly the same order at every stop of the tour, from Long Island to Stockholm. Thoroughly consistent, especially by Dylan’s later live standards, the repeated performances from the 22 represented shows might be seen as feature, not a bug. Listening to oblique narrative epics like “Visions of Johanna” and dense truth attacks like “Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat” over and over, each becomes like a sculpture viewed from different angles, each liable to reveal something new about the lyrics or melody or interplay between musicians. The 1966 Live Recordings builds itself around discs 19 and 20, a long-bootlegged show from Manchester officially released in 1998. Containing the notorious back-and-forth in which an audience member calls Dylan “Judas!” and Dylan snarls back, \\\\\"I don’t be-lieve you, you’re a liar\\\\\" (and to the musicians “play fuckin’ loud”), the Manchester show also finds the just-exactly-perfect balance of performance, soundman Richard Alderson’s mix, and high drama. Listened to in the context of the gigs on either side of it, one hears Dylan and the Group (as they were capitalized at the time in the British music press) circling around the tempos and inflections of what would become the classic performance of the material.But each disc—even the barely listenable audience recordings—has its own rewards for the committed Dylanologist, from on- and off-stage histrionics to a range of varied mixes, each with its own personality. Turning 25 on May 24th in Paris (discs 26 and 27), Dylan goes into near meltdown, attempting desperately to get his acoustic instrument in tune. “This never happens to my electric guitar,” he deadpans, a punchline deployed many nights, part prop theater (“This machine confuses fascists”), part a musician's nightmare of gear damaged in transit. Slurring his words, Dylan is deeply inside of both himself and his songs, his Woody Guthrie drawl blurred into the oft-caricatured nasal howl. One takeaway, though, and perhaps the perpetual Dylan hot take, is that the dude actually is an amazing singer, lingering sensuously on every syllable during the quiet acoustic sets and occupying every bit of smarter-than-thou word-play and put-downs when the electric guitars come out. “It takes a lot of medicine to keep up this pace,” Dylan told journalist Robert Shelton that year, and various accounts (including those of liner-notes writer Clinton Heylin) hint at Dylan’s prodigious chemical intake during his extended world tour in 1966. Dylan had been touring in the electric\\/acoustic format since the previous summer, cramming in studio sessions between an extended fall tour with his new accompanists. The former backing group for Arkansas-born rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins, the ex-Hawks played 60 gigs with Dylan in the fall of 1965 and spring of 1966, drummer Levon Helm bailing in late November, before the start of Dylan's first world tour in 1966. Helm and others can be heard on the scant fall ’65 audience tapes released as downloads last year, and Sandy Konikoff can be made out (barely) on the audience-recorded discs from the American leg, stuck rightfully at the end of this set. But it’s the hard-hitting Mickey Jones (later seen in bearded form as neighbor Pete Bilker on ABC’s “Home Improvement”) who galvanizes the band from April of 1966 onward, providing gun-shot snare-cracks to start songs and a dependably rolling thunder. “In my group, the drummer is the lead guitar player,” Dylan would tell a press conference a quarter-century later, and Jones totally wails.Often dismissed in the British music papers, the Group was anything but typical, owing especially to the double piano\\/organ attack of Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. Filling the corners of each song with soulful R&B color and sometimes lost in the mix, Manuel can be heard especially on the May 14th show in Liverpool (disc 14), adding on boogie-woogie filigrees to “Baby, Let Me Follow You Down.” Though Hudson's solos are few and far between, one of the recurring pleasures of the box comes with his conversational fills between vocal lines every night on “Ballad of a Thin Man,” with Dylan taking over for Manuel at piano. Perhaps the keynote for the entire period, Dylan milks the tune for every last insult.With Jones driving them, Manuel, Hudson, Danko, and lead guitarist Robbie Robertson make room for one another, all while heeding Dylan’s urgent rhythm playing, an electrified bandleader for barely six months by the time of the box set’s chronological opening on February 5th in White Plains. Climaxing all sets but one with “Like A Rolling Stone”—a #4 hit in the UK the previous year, #2 back home—was almost a joke in itself, a reminder that none of this electricity should be any sort of surprise. With most of the violent upheavals of the ’60s still building towards a fever pitch, Dylan had gradually moved away from overt topicality beginning with 1964’s Another Side of Bob Dylan, adding electric instruments to the mix for 1965’s Bringing It All Back Home. And, every night, “Like A Rolling Stone” makes a thrilling conclusion, Dylan yawping out the vocals, Robertson and pals transforming the sparkle of the 1965 studio rendition into an ethereal punch. Speaking almost entirely in parables in interviews and press conferences, the Bob Dylan that stood in front of audiences in 1966 had an unearthly air, a beautiful and vibrating young alien. “Bob Dylan got very sick backstage and I’m here to take his place,” he announces in Glasgow (disc 21), but whoever it is that's wearing the Bob Dylan mask positively glows. The folkies were right, of course, in that he and his lyrics had drifted far from topical concerns, replacing them with a personal expression that spoke more to the abstract intellectual autonomy of the counterculture than the ongoing issues of the New Left. But sharpened even beyond that, the acoustic sets possess a stark beauty, like a series of elegant black-and-white portraits. It would be the last time Dylan regularly performed extended solo acoustic sets, and it is a form he has mastered. Finding a subtlety in his harmonica playing, it ranges from spare melodic statements like the introduction to “Fourth Time Around” to more abstract honkings (such as the concluding solos in “Desolation Row”) perhaps more akin to what soundman Richard Alderson had recorded as house engineer at avant-garde label ESP’-Disk. At times, such as on the terrible February 5th audience tape from the Westchester County Center in New York, Dylan squonks up and down the harp for comedic value, but mostly it’s an instrument as weird and pliable as Dylan’s voice.The long-haul listening experience of 29.5 hours of music provides able space for contemplation, a manner of observing Dylan’s work in real time, hearing him earn giggles for his then-unreleased “Norwegian Wood” answer song “Fourth Time Around” in Sheffield (disc 17) and endlessly tweak the work-in-progress electric set opener “Tell Me, Momma” at every stop of the tour. Dylan doesn’st settle on a single set of lyrics throughout the 20 surviving performances of this song, which was never recorded in a studio; the official lyrics in his published lyrics book (and on his website) bear only fragmentary resemblance to any version documented on the box set. A lost classic, never performed again after 1966, each version flashes by in a perfect torrent of Dylan-esque babble, as if he were scribbling in a notebook, trying out endless variations. To Dylan, his sets with this Group seemed to represent the next step in his work. Though only Robbie Robertson featured on Blonde on Blonde, in stores a few weeks after the tour concluded, Dylan would rush-release the Liverpool recording of “Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues” as the B-side of the last pre-album single, “I Want You.” In addition to spending post-show time with the Group and his entourage reviewing Alderson’s recordings, Dylan continued to work off-hours on even more new songs, with a half-dozen fragments of hotel songwriting sessions with Robertson included on last year’s The Cutting Edge, almost all abandoned after the tour. Operating at high speed in every regard, Dylan’s career would take a major turn after a motorcycle accident in Woodstock in July, canceling the next legs of the tour, eschewing live performance until 1969, and staying off the road until 1974. The 1966 Live Recordings, then, are a definitive cap on one of the most productive and astounding periods in any popular artist’s creative history, a story so familiar it’s become an archetype and myth. While the recordings sound pristine as might be hoped, give or take occasional distortion, the accompanying packaging is left a bit wanting. The long liner note essay by longtime Dylan scholar Clinton Heylin is excellent, but the mere quantity of music seems to demand even more material than the set provides, or even just more caring annotation of what is included, like the dates of film stills or even the names of the concerts’ venues. (Heylin’s own recent book Judas! From Forest Hills to the Free Trade Hall is an excellent start.)The box set offers dramatic resolution, too. During the tour's penultimate gig, at London’s Royal Albert Hall (disc 29), Dylan’s syllable-crunching shout-singing bounces gracefully off the Group’s elastic crunch, a performance every bit as transcendent as Manchester. But on the last night (disc 31), Dylan finally snaps, and after the electric set-opening “Tell Me, Momma,” offers a completely earnest and logical explanation for the music. “I like all my old songs, it's just that things change all the time, everybody knows that,” he says in part. It’s so earnest, in fact, that he finds himself speaking words that one would rarely associate with the future Nobel laureate. “The music is… the music is… I would never venture to say what it is,” Dylan trails off, perhaps even shocking himself in his attempted candor. But on this final night of the tour, mostly, Dylan finally sounds too far gone, his voice weak. He and the Group seem to fray in places, and in doing so reveal the other 21 performances for the high-wire achievements they were and are. “You can take it or leave it, it’s up to you,” Dylan says, and the choice still exists, the answer out there blowin’ somewhere.\"],[22640,\"Two decades on, Ricardo Villalobos is well into the “Friends & Family” phase of his career: The Chilean-German electronic musician often goes for remixes or collaborations—with the likes of synthesist Max Loderbauer, for example, or guitarist Oren Ambarchi—over solo productions. This two-track EP, for Santiago’s Drumma Records, sees Villalobos team with fellow Chilean artist Umho as Ricmho. Like many of Villalobos’ scattered collaborations, you can be forgiven for not recognizing this particular partner in crime: Umho has a scant two releases to his name (which are themselves collaborations) despite a long-running and healthy DJ career.Melo de Melo feels more substantial, owing to its nearly 30-minute runtime. Uhmo and Villalobos have frequently shared the DJ booth over the years, and the EP is billed as a celebration of their shared love for Latin American music. While Umho’s limited production record makes it difficult to suss out who contributed what, the EP is full of the quick, pitched percussion that dots typical Villalobos tracks. Squint and you can hear a conga, or a timbale, or a maraca, all deployed with a busyness foreign to stodgier, upbeat\\/downbeat dance patterns. Still, Melo de Melo scans as Latin American in pretty much the same manner all Villalobos productions do.The A-side, “Por Suerte,” features a resonant ping played with considerable vigor and debatable purpose. It sticks out in a thicket of percussion that, for much of the track, masks a warm, evolving ambient melody. That melody breaks through in the track’s final minute as the pops and clicks fade, churning slowly and sounding considerably more reflective and calm than your average Villalobos work. The EP’s title track (credited only to Villalobos) begins more conventionally, with a steady kick and a sparring match between a conga and a snare. Halfway through, Villalobos introduces a long, evolving sample that sounds like a string quartet being kneaded into itself. By the end of the track, it’s a roughly diced, digitally charred wreck.It’s a beautiful sequence, one that underlines how Villalobos seems increasingly interested in welding avant-garde composition and dance music. (See also: last year’s Vilod collaboration with Loderbauer, in which the duo wrung minimal jazz out of their synthesizers.) Villalobos remains commendably weird in almost every way, even if, as a project, Ricmho seems only half-formed. Ultimately, that’s why Melo de Melo underwhelms, however slightly: Villalobos has been churning out jammy, crumbling tracks like this for most of a decade at this point, and these are hardly the jammiest, or the most crumbly.\"],[22688,\"No subliminal messaging for Peder Mannerfelt: on Equality Now, he wears his politics on his record sleeve. Hailing from Stockholm, Mannerfelt is a skillful engineer and a tireless collaborator. As well as his solo production work, he performs as one half of analog synth duo Roll the Dice, has produced records for Blonde Redhead and Glasser under the name the Subliminal Kid, and played an integral role in Karin Dreijer Andersson’s Fever Ray. He shares a few common interests with Andersson—emancipatory politics, exotic rhythms, and Brothers Grimm dress-up. Playing live, he wears a waist-length wig that obscures his face, making him look like a sort of techno Rapunzel.The Equality Now EP marks Mannerfelt’s first output on Numbers, the Glasgow dance imprint that discovered Rustie and SOPHIE, among others. Its three tracks explore three quite different directions, while holding to a few base tenets: clever ideas, executed simply, with a minimum of gloss or clutter. The title track is crisp, propulsive techno produced with such economy that you probably couldn’t excise a single aspect without the whole thing disintegrating. Arid drums lock into a manic bounce, synth lines bend and flex into strange timbres and two synthetic voices—one male, one female—intone the world “equality”, mostly in unison, sometimes a tantalizing half-beat out of of step. Its repetition recalls a chant or a march: grassroots activism tailored for the dancefloor.While at first glance Equality Now’s productions can appear fairly simplistic, they often conceal ingenious elements. “Breaking Patterns,” the EP’s second track, is a borderline-crude acid number that contains rhythmic echoes of Mannerfelt’s 2015 LP The Swedish Congo Record—a sonic “research project” which attempted to fastidiously recreate 1930s field recordings of tribal music in the Belgian Congo using modern tools. Taut hand drums pound ceaselessly, as synthesizers spit out electronic zaps and distressed strings crawl mournfully across the frame. But most of the action happens on a microscopic level: beats form themselves into unusual polyrhythms that morph and reshape, while small twists of FX or a shifting mix suddenly jolt the track onto a new footing.Equality Now bows out with “Rules, Ropes & Strings,” an ambient piece that pares back the beats and ushers in slow tidal washes of shimmering texture. It’s a strangely sedate end for a record that is elsewhere out to enthuse or provoke. Hardly unusual for a figure as mercurial as Mannerfelt, though. This is music guided by impulse, not premeditation; music in which an idea is good, right up until the moment that it’s spent.\"],[22696,\"Some time this March, a SWAT team descended on a home in a wooded, well-to-do North Carolina suburb. According to the producer Elite, helicopters vultured overhead as armed officers broke down the front door and raided the house, presumably acting on a tip from a neighbor who believed the occupants were manufacturing or selling drugs. There was no one home; masked and bulletproof-vested men kept pouring inside. Instead of a grow-op, officers found a basement littered with recording equipment, the bones of a creative hideout that had filled the community with little more than some errant blunt smoke.The house was J. Cole’s. It wasn’t the native North Carolinian’s only property holding: he’d previously purchased his childhood home, at 2014 Forest Hills Drive in Fayetteville, with plans to turn it into a rent-free safe haven for single mothers. On his last solo effort—which was named after the Fayetteville house—he rapped about his adolescent fantasies of white picket fences surrounded by trees, by quiet. The SWAT experience, recounted on “Neighbors,” the best song from Cole’s fourth album, 4 Your Eyez Only, is a grim perversion of those dreams, and it anchors a record that wrestles with the fragility of life and the importance of family ties.For long stretches, Eyez is a rumination on death. Cole frequently invokes other points of view, including that of his late friend James McMillan, Jr., who was killed at 22. The album is peppered with references to his murder, and a testimony from a young girl in Fayetteville, which appears at two points on “Ville Mentality,” echoes the reality faced by McMillan’s own daughter. Cole is himself a new father (“She’s Mine, Pt. 2” is about his wife and newborn child), and the title track, which closes the album with a missive for those young girls, is anchored by his personal anxieties, making for some of Cole’s most affecting writing to date.He also comes to life on “Immortal,” which sounds as if someone played Cole an unheard 2Pac song from the Makaveli sessions and then dared him to recreate it from memory. The song’s narrator feeds baggies through a burglar bar, watches Bic lighters wave under spoons, wakes up early to hit the Bowflex. It’s details like that last one that set “Immortal” apart from so much of Cole’s early work: you can see the speaker bathed in the artificial light of 3 a.m. infomercials, figuring he needs to put some weight on. He equivocates—“crime pays like a part-time job” is the sort of evocative, economical phrase that has eluded Cole so often in the past. And when he rattles off rhetorical questions (“Have you ever seen a nigga that was Black on the moon?\\/Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?\\/Have you ever seen a motherfucking ribbon in the sky?”) he’s working in a long tradition of rappers and writers knocking a grave present against against its opposite. To that end, at the song’s most defiant moment, Cole nods to his real life: “If they want a nigga, they gon’ have to send a SWAT team.”At its lowest points, 4 Your Eyez Only rehashes Cole’s worst tendencies. “No Role Modelz,” a breakout hit from 2014 Forest Hills Drive, tried to cast crass, regressive ideas about women as a moral struggle; “Deja Vu” is its mopey inverse, where Cole shouts over the music in a club to ask “Who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?\\/Tell me, is your house a home?” The song also lapses into some of the album’s laziest writing, like “On a scale from 1 to 10, that girl’s a hundred.” It’s like “Marvin’s Room” for guys who brought their high school letter jackets to college. (It’s worth noting that while “Deja Vu” and Bryson Tiller’s massive “Exchange” share a sample and, at points, have similar drum programming, producer Vinylz claims that he and Boi-1da produced “Deja Vu” before its beat was stolen and repurposed for the Tiller version.)Speaking of production, that’s the one area where Eyez falls far behind Forest Hills Drive. After “Deja Vu,” the album slips into a three-song lull of pale, ornate music—unfortunate because the songs grapple with the early death of parents, Cole’s love for his wife, and McMillan’s death, respectively. “Ville Mentality” in particular plays like an interlude, and it might in fact be better served with just its hook and the aforementioned words from a young woman. Eyez sorely misses the type of serrated edge given to Forest Hills Drive by tracks like “03’ Adolescence,” “G.O.M.D.,” or “Fire Squad.” For this record, Cole leans more heavily on his singing voice than ever before—a welcome change at points, but it pushes the middle section of Eyez onto the sleepier side of the ledger.Aside from the moments when he taps into something greater (“Immortal,” “Neighbors,” “4 Your Eyez Only”), Cole’s most marked improvement comes by sanding down the more grating parts of his style. There is less moralistic grandstanding, and no lines about bodily functions or leftover Italian food. In their place are references to airbrushed RIP shirts and private prison shareholders. That said, a dutiful focus on the album’s central storyline means there aren’t big swings or long tangents in any direction, and aside from that trio of great tracks, Cole seldom sounds like he’s leaving it all out on the field.But Eyez often feels like a natural extension from the more overtly political tone of Cole’s public comments since his trip to Ferguson in August of 2014. This isn’t a protest record in the acute sense, but it’s unavoidably the product of the types of oppression that beckon SWAT teams into suburban homes on nothing but hearsay. In that vein, the most quietly radical decision Cole makes here is following “Neighbors” with a song called “Foldin’ Clothes,” where he and his wife shirk the outside world for Netflix and almond milk. That domestic stillness—stillness that might be interrupted at any moment by helicopters or an evening news report—is fragile, and that fragility is its own devastating statement. \"],[22663,\"“Today’s underground may be the answer to tomorrow’s leisure,” intones an earnest British newscaster, narrating film of London’s U.F.O. Club circa January 1967 while its house band, Pink Floyd, jams amid the flashing lights. And darned if he wasn’t right: the black-and-white segment is now found on the massive new $550, 11-CD\\/9-DVD\\/8 Blu-Ray box set, Pink Floyd: The Early Years, 1965–1972. With over 27 hours of material, the package overflows with replica 45 rpm singles, gig flyers, posters, tickets, sheet music, and more, and the ark-like box should provide serious leisure-time satisfaction for both longtime Floyd freaks and aspiring heads alike.The Early Years tells the remarkable story of Pink Floyd’s career up through the moment they became part of yesterday’s underground and today’s mainstream, stopping just before the writing and recording of 1973’s Dark Side of the Moon. Charting the band’s progression from the wig-flipping baroque psychedelia of Syd Barrett’s songwriting through their wooliest jams and into the new space beyond, The Early Years doesn’t follow a straight path. It shows an astonishing capacity to turn corners and evolve, a long arc that might give hope to every band jamming away in its practice space in search of a voice.Beginning as a blues combo with the perfectly British drug-punning name the Tea Set (“tea” being slang for weed, maaaan), the band rechristened themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound by the time of the 1965 demo sessions that open the box’s first disc. Though not particularly competent or interesting R&B players, as demonstrated by their cover of Slim Harpo’s “I’m a King Bee” just as much as an untitled 1968 “Blues Jam” on a later disc, it’s fascinating to hear Barrett’s already distinctly bent rhythm guitar as filtered through the Bo Diddley beat of “Double O Bo.” Unheard before being released in 2015 as a double 7\\\\\" for Record Store Day, the 1965 sessions also highlight the first fruits of Barrett’s songwriting, the playfulness of “Butterfly” displaying the stylist and singer he already was. “Along with Anthony Newley, he was the first guy I’d heard to sing pop or rock with a British accent,” David Bowie would say of Barrett, a madcap permission-granter for a new generation of British musicians less beholden to imitating their American heroes.Leaving the band in a haze of mental health issues in early 1968, Barrett’s legend would loom over the quartet for years. On the set’s volume from that year, titled Germin\\/Ation, Floyd’s earliest songwriting without their former leader sounds like a drab imitation, with keyboardist Rick Wright’s “It Would Be So Nice” anticipating the B-list ’60s twee-pop parodied by Spinal Tap on “Cups and Cakes.” Instead, Floyd would start to find themselves in the deep space of their early jam centerpiece, “Interstellar Overdrive,” the nearly 10-minute freak-out that closed their 1967 debut and whose descending chromatic riff dropped them into the beyond. With seven versions on the set, including a devastatingly weird DVD\\/Blu Ray-only 1969 take of the later slower arrangement featuring Frank Zappa on guitar, the song would provide the first portal for the band’s furthest explorations. (One of the set’s few big bummers is that it doesn’t offer audio-only downloads of the live performances featured on the visual discs.)For fans of Floyd’s experimental tendencies, The Early Years offers enormous fun, beginning with a never-bootlegged soundtrack session. Recorded by the Barrett-era lineup in October 1967 to accompany an abstract film by John Latham, the nine takes are all light show swirl, star-splatter guitar, and primitively convincing free drumming by Nick Mason. And though, later on, Barrett replacement David Gilmour would rightly become known as a guitar hero, his playing throughout The Early Years is judicious when it comes to solos. Wailing some tasty space-blues on “Careful With That Axe, Eugene” during a jam-heavy August 1969 set from Amsterdam and a blistering “Atom Heart Mother” from Montreux ’70, Gilmour just as often fits into the band’s tapestry of gentle cymbal taps and moody keyboard filigrees.Where their American countercultural cousins in the Grateful Dead found mind-manifesting wonder in their musical interpretation of cosmic space, the Floyd more often channeled the cold vacuum and existential tedium, perhaps a reflection of the post-psychedelic fate of Barrett. “Moonhead,” their soundtrack to the Moon landing performed live on BBC TV and captured on Bonus Continu\\/Ation, is a deliberate controlled float, more proto-symphonic than hippie jam. It’s this questioning sadness that the band starts to tap into during their 1969 sessions, the first mournful strains that would find their fullest expression on Dark Side of the Moon. The watershed event comes when Waters’ “Cymbaline” and “Green is the Colour” and Gilmour’s “The Narrow Way” all first turn up on the box, part of a May 1969 BBC recording for John Peel; it’s one of seven sessions for the DJ, all classic bootlegs in their own right.In slightly different and renamed form, all three songs play a part in one of the box’s most enticing if imperfect pieces: a complete live recording of The Journey and The Man, the band’s first attempt at conceptual suites of music, performed as two halves of a show on several occasions in 1969. Though fans have attempted to reconstruct the performances as though it were a lost album, the actual product includes reworked existing pieces, going back as far as “Pow. R Toc H.,” from their 1967 debut, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, here becoming “The Pink Jungle.” Performed with onstage happenings and fourth-wall-breaking intrusions, the music is a fascinating forerunner to Floyd’s more successful theatrics. With sci-fi noir atmospherics (“The Labyrinths of Auximines”), live musique concrète featuring band-members sawing through wood (“Work”), overblown drum solos in disguise (“Doing It”), as well as genetic connections to the Anglophonic fun of the Syd era (Waters’ “Afternoon,” collected as “Biding My Time” on 1971’s Relics), the two suites are first drafts. That the band scrapped them and moved along to the next ambitious projects in the queue is yet another testament to their developing editing skills.As career periods go, the seven years of Pink Floyd’s Early Years don’t exactly match other intense eras of classic rock creativity, like Bob Dylan from 1961 to 1968 or the Beatles from 1962 to 1969. But this set illustrates something about both Pink Floyd’s own path and the rewards of resilience. While remembered for their outsized onstage gestures like inflatable pigs and the disassembly of a giant wall, the real revelation of The Early Years is to hear exactly how slowly and modestly Pink Floyd came into themselves; despite the scale of their ambition, the box feels less a blueprint than a scale model. While Barrett’s contributions remain singular, the development of the band over these years wasn’t so much genius than inspired workmanship, not all of it successful. David Gilmour’s “Fat Old Sun,” appearing first on a July 1970 Peel session, is less compelling in its 15-minute jammed-out incarnation the following year. “Embryo,” though, develops from a three-minute post-Barrett psych-folk bauble on a 1968 BBC session to a fully realized 10-minute prog arrangement by 1971, the band’s restlessness apparent and worthwhile.There’s plenty to gnaw on, from Barrett’s whimsy to the formless countercultural yearning of the middle years to the emergence of Waters and Gilmour as songwriters to the brilliant suite-making of 1971’s “Echoes.” While the band would shatter amid acrimonious lawsuits a decade after this set’s conclusion, the music is the sound of musicians working in concert towards an unseen and unknown goal. In the modern age of oversized vault-clearing and copyright-protecting box sets, there is something resoundingly human about The Early Years, which only makes the achievements more extraordinary. Concluding with a new mix of 1972’s Obscured by Clouds (excluding bonus material), one can hear all the pieces of their more iconic future albums clicking into place and the sound of space closing around them into something more fixed. But that’s the topic of another box set.\"],[22687,\"The stakes were high for Harley Edward Streten. In 2012, the Sydney, Australia-based producer, who records as Flume, released his self-titled album as EDM was reaching peak cultural saturation. Flume’s beat-oriented sound—experimental enough for comparisons to LA’s Brainfeeder scene, pop enough to best One Direction in the charts—was so quick to catch fire that even Streten seemed shocked by his ascendency. “There was a lot of hype,” he told Complex recently. “It exploded in Australia first and then the rest of the world was coming on board and it was quite a process.” This was only one year after his first live show, and Flume—then 21—had a legitimate hit album and the attention of music’s biggest names. Over the next 36 months he would remix Lorde, Disclosure, Sam Smith, and Arcade Fire. So, when it came time for to drop Skin, the burden was heavy to prove he was more than just the flavor of the moment. “I struggled with the pressure of having the successful record after the first record,” he said. “Second album syndrome. I’m living proof; it’s very real.” Streten’s way of dealing with astronomical expectations, as it turned out, were equally large ambitions: if Flume was a beat maker flirting with pop, Skin was a pop record with an experimental sense of rhythm. The sixteen-track album was stacked with legacy giants and alt-pop darlings, among them: Beck, Raekwon, Vince Staples, Little Dragon, AlunaGeorge, MNDR, and Vic Mensa. Some songs, like “Tiny Cities,” were successes. (Beck recast as a future-pop Beach Boy was an unexpected win.) More often, however, the features roster seemed a cagey distraction to Flume’s more left-field impulses. Skin Companion 1, is billed as the first EP, presumably in a series, that will feature music recorded from the same sessions that produced Skin. But while that album emerged from a sous-vide of industry hype, its companion isn’t nearly as overdone. Of the EP’s four tracks, only one, “Trust,” features a guest vocalist—the Preatures’ Isabella Manfredi—and she’s here because she makes sense for the song, not to generate buzz. (The Preatures, like Flume, are New South Wales natives.) The result is a glitchy and glossy R&B-inflected tune, somewhere between CHVRCHES and Natasha Kmeto, with all the punch of Skin standout single, “Never Be Like You.”The remainder of the album features more airy successes, similar to the shorter cuts on Skin. “V” rattles and clatters for under three minutes, blending organic percussion, disembodied vocals, and elastic synths; the sound is surreal and meditative, like playing pick-up-sticks in a zen garden might be. The EP’s most straightforward track, “Heater,” is restrained compared to the Glastonbury-ready productions on Skin. It could work as a festival experience—there’s a mellow mid-section drop—but the compressed synths invite enthusiastic head nods, not dancing. The EP closes with “Quirk.” Etherial and unstructured, a soulful vocal sample drifts atop percussion that never quite reaches Arca-levels of avant-garde. Flume's album art, which looks like weaponized, net-art ikebana, does an accurate job of capturing a sound that is as biological as it is mechanical.Had something like Skin Companion 1 came out before the release of Flume’s sophomore effort, fans would probably be questioning Streten’s muscle: these are subtle productions, more Gold Panda than SBTRKT. But now that we’ve seen Flume’s version of laser-focused hit making, it’s nice to him in a painterly, if insubstantial mode. After holding his breath for four years, it was time for Flume to exhale. \"],[22662,\"While Turkey boasted its own heady rock scene during the late 1960s, the Anatolian Invasion didn’t make much of a dent in the West. Were it not for the tireless digging and reissues from imprints like Andy Votel’s Finders Keepers, Pharaway Sounds, and Sublime Frequencies, we still might know little about Turkish rock. Sure, the searing strings of Erkin Koray, Muhlis Akarsu, and the like may have appealed to Woodstock-era rock fans, but the thundering drums underpinning them led to a Turkish revival of sorts decades later, with everyone from the Gaslamp Killer and the Weeknd to Timbaland sampling Turkish music.But back home, a military coup in 1980 led to Turkey’s rock scene being repressed to the point of near-extinction. It’s only recently that it’s begun emanating beyond the borders, though with President Erdoğan’s new crackdowns on dissent, one fears it might be a short-lived renaissance. Ever since her 2014 debut, vocalist Gaye Su Akyol has emerged at the fore this revitalized music scene, alongside acts like Ayyuka and Büyük Ev Ablukada. The music is unmistakably Turkish in its heritage—the modes and scales to the guitars mimic the baglama and ud—but there are rock influences as well, from Nevermind and Nick Cave to “White Rabbit.” This confluence of East and West makes Hologram Ĭmparatorluğu an intriguing listen even to those who don’t speak Turkish.A dizzying updraft of buzzing strings immediately makes “Hologram” soar. But while the music alludes to transcendence and the song, on the surface, is about love, it’s also about seeing through such an illusion (fitting for a group whose live shows often feature Akyol and band in masks and an album title that translates as “Hologram Empire”). “Thought I had a new world found\\/I was fooled,” Akyol sings, but listen closer and Akyol’s august voice also hints at capture and escape, which feels both surreal and real at once: “I am being seized\\/Two baby finches, let’s escape there\\/To Pluto.”Akyol’s father is famous Turkish painter Muzaffer Akyol, and in his vivid, dreamlike canvases, there’s an antecedent for his daughter’s language. On the simmering, bandoneon-laced “Anlasana Sana Aşiğim,” Akyol’s lyrics on love are by-turns strange and tactile: “I’ve become a butterfly\\/Come and find me\\/Black holes are everywhere\\/Confessions all clandestine.” The Bad Seeds influence comes through on the noir-ish throb and reverb guitar riffs of “Dünya kaleska,” and Akyol’s lyrics convey bleakness worthy of Cave.Snaking hand percussion and rattles gives “Eski tüfek” a driving pulse, matched by the surf guitars of her backing band, Bubituzak. Their guitars are as comfortable evoking the likes of Erkin Koray as they are Dick Dale and Ennio Morricone’s spaghetti western themes, heightening the drama of Akyol’s songs. Closer “Berdus” rides a lashing guitar riff and percolating bassline that gives the song a steady building rhythm, as Akyol imagines herself lost in the woods like Little Red Riding Hood and conjures wolves and bears alike. Just don’t mistake it for a fairytale ending. For as the music fades away, Akyol’s last line leaves a pejorative image for her fellow countrymen, and, well, everyone: “Yesterday’s piece of shit has become king over our head.”\"],[22317,\"Jeff Buckley would be 50 years old this year, and it’s hard not to think about what he’d be up to right now. As an adopted son of New York City’s downtown art scene in the 1990s, he could be wailing truth to power, like Patti Smith. As someone who hated how the early internet infringed on his privacy, he could have turned into an elusive icon, like Fiona Apple. A virtuoso guitarist with perfect pitch and a keen ear for improvisation, he may have leaned into Los Angeles’ embrace of modern jazz, jamming with Thundercat and Kamasi Washington. As a punk purist who was drawn to severe sounds and radical ideas toward the end of his life, maybe he would have turned into an anti-establishment musical figurehead, like Steve Albini. He could have coupled electronics with progressive politics and the voice of a fallen angel, like ANOHNI. Or, as an acolyte of George Carlin and David Letterman who was known for his outlandishly comical stage banter, maybe he would have given up music altogether and tried his luck at biting comedy. Would he have been excited by the way his version of “Hallelujah” became such a ubiquitous hymn, or repulsed by its overuse? Then again, without his tragic story as ballast, would “Hallelujah” have ever seen a resurgence at all?Such what-ifs are inevitable when an artist dies too soon, but fruitless daydreaming is especially tantalizing when it comes to Buckley. His talents were so limitless, his range so vast, and his explorations of them so inchoate. In his 30 years, he lived a head-spinning number of musical lives, as chronicled in David Browne’s essential biography, Dream Brother. Growing up in Orange County in the ’70s, Buckley was obsessed with the prog theatrics of Styx, Yes, and Genesis. In his early days as a professional musician, he played with reggae and hair metal bands. During that time, he paid the bills as a guitarist and songwriter for hire, creating hacky tracks for a variety of L.A. up-and-comers, from R&B crooners to precious singer-songwriters. He made a proper name for himself in tiny Manhattan clubs through ecstatic solo covers of everyone from Nina Simone to Van Morrison to Pakistani qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Such fluidity would be unique in any era, but especially in the early ’90s, when the internet had yet to fully flatten barriers between styles, Buckley’s musical interests were freakishly broad. At a 1993 show, he mimicked Khan’s chanting vocals over the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” riff as a delightfully bemused audience tried to take it all in. Following the impromptu mashup, he quipped: “I’m a ridiculous person.”This ridiculousness miraculously came together on 1994’s Grace, an album that combined psychedelia, Led Zeppelin-style hard rock, shimmering pop, torch balladry, and a hymn originally written in the 16th century. Released in the middle of grunge mania, it was an ethereal tonic. Grace was not an instant hit by any means—the record sold 2,000 copies in its opening week and only went platinum at the beginning of this year. But Buckley’s label, the Sony-owned Columbia, home to legends like Dylan and Springsteen, put a ton of money into the project nonetheless, sending the singer around the globe with his band on tour to help kick off what they hoped to be a decades-long career. Though he was signed to a major label, Buckley was forever mindful of upholding the sacredness of his music and avoiding the evils of commercialism—necessary objectives at a time when alternative culture was being streamlined by corporations at a breakneck pace. His artsier tendencies sometimes clashed with Columbia’s bottom line, but in general he was given the room—and cash—to make his own choices, with the label figuring they’d eventually recoup on their investment later on. Buckley was in a privileged position, and he undoubtedly enjoyed the runway he was being offered, but being associated with a global conglomerate weighed on him. He was a punk at heart, after all. He admired the way Kurt Cobain was able to navigate the industry before he killed himself, and hung a photo of the Nirvana frontman in his bus while touring behind Grace. And there was another artist whose battles with commerce were always in the back of Buckley’s mind: his father Tim. Buckley barely knew his dad, but he was well aware of Tim’s legacy as a risk-taking singer-songwriter in the ’60s and ’70s who was chewed up by the business before he died of a heroin overdose in 1975 at age 28. The son was adamant not to follow his father’s path, going so far as to poke fun at such tragic rock‘n’roll mythologies onstage. In this way, Buckley wanted his art to capture all the romantic wonders of ’60s pop while maintaining the knowing cynicism of his own era—a tough balance even without a genealogy filled with alcoholism, mental instability, and dire misfortune.So under increased pressure from his label, Buckley began nursing a contrarian streak and attempted to trade in Grace’s gorgeous softness for something spikier and confrontational with his second album. There were troubles from the start. The initial rehearsal sessions with his band at the end of 1995 didn’t go anywhere. Soon after, his drummer quit. Columbia started throwing around potential producers to try to get the album on track, radio-friendly names like Butch Vig, Brendan O’Brien, Steve Lillywhite, or even Brian Eno. Buckley had a different idea: erstwhile Television frontman Tom Verlaine. This was years before the Strokes would put Verlaine’s band—and its scuzzy postpunk lineage—back in the spotlight, and the producer was about as far as you could get from a typical hitmaker. Which is exactly what Buckley wanted. In the summer of 1996, Buckley and his band—including an inexperienced new drummer—recorded their first session with Verlaine in New York. Nobody was happy with the results and, that October, Buckley wrote in his journal: “I’m going to lay off the band.” Instead, he replaced one new drummer with another and continued to work on his in-progress songs, trying to nail down the more lo-fi sound in his head, something like the blunt force of contemporary underground acts such as the Grifters, Polvo, and the Jesus Lizard. He was over the pristine untouchability of “Hallelujah.” Feeling boxed in by Manhattan, Buckley decided to follow his friends in the Grifters to Memphis, where he regrouped with his band and Verlaine for another recording session in February 1997. Once again, the experience didn’t live up to Buckley’s high standards, as he was constantly rearranging songs and tweaking lyrics in search of the right sound and feel. He was a perfectionist with an encyclopedic knowledge of rock history and a masterful musical talent; he had so many choices, and whereas that dexterity once served as a stunning resume, it was now stymying him.After the February session, Buckley realized Verlaine was not the man to bring his album to fruition, and it was decided that Grace producer Andy Wallace would sit in the control booth when the time was right. The band went back to New York, and Buckley stayed in Memphis, in an empty shotgun shack on a nondescript block with only the house’s jumping fleas to keep him company. He continued writing, taping ideas onto his four-track recorder. Away from the stress of New York, he loosened up, playing weekly gigs at a dive bar to small crowds. His musical brain started to flow and, by the spring, he felt like he had finally figured out what his album should be. He sent demo tapes to each of the three members of his band, summoning them down to Memphis once again on May 29, 1997. But around the same time they were touching down at the airport, Buckley decided to take a spontaneous dip into the nearby Wolf River in black boots and an “Altamont” T-shirt, singing Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” while doing the backstroke. Then a barge glided by. Its current tugged Buckley underneath the water. He was gone. Following his death, Columbia intended to cull a 10-track album from the two Verlaine sessions and release it under Buckley’s working title, My Sweetheart the Drunk, in late 1997. His mother, who took charge of her son’s estate, nixed that plan, and instead compiled a two-disc set featuring tracks from the Verlaine sessions as well as some of the four-track experiments Buckley was compiling in his small house. Either way, there’s no getting around the fact that Buckley did not want any of the recordings on Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk to be heard. Even so, it’s a fascinating document, one that lifts the lid on a prodigy’s creative process and lets us peer into an erratic mind that could be too mercurial for its own good.From the first few seconds, it’s clear that this is not Grace 2. Opener “Sky Is a Landfill” is the closest Buckley ever came to agitprop, a denunciation of capitalist and media systems that now reads prophetic, if a bit overwritten. “Turn your head away from the screen, oh people,” he sings, “it will tell you nothing more.” Considering the proliferation of smartphones in the last 20 years—and the untruths and addictions that have come with them—it’s easy to see the warning as wisdom. Meanwhile, the music is stark and fuzzed out, like a post-hardcore version of the Smashing Pumpkins. Its angst has not aged terribly well, though, as with everything on this document, it definitely allows for future greatness—what if he changed that one wordy line, or smoothed out that other transition? Listening to an incomplete work like Sketches, it’s natural for anyone to turn into a music critic, picking at things that could be improved. And it’s reasonable to think Buckley was doing the same exact thing in Memphis. Though he was aiming for something gritty with the new music, the general rule with Sketches goes: The less distorted the song, the better it holds up. Buckley’s voice, which could go from divinely supple to shockingly overwrought, just sounds better when it’s not trying to blow the room out. Just because he could sing anything doesn’t mean he should sing anything. “Yard of Blonde Girls,” written by a few of Buckley’s friends, is a grungy trifle that has him trying out his best Alice in Chains impression. The singer originally hid the song from Columbia thinking they might glom onto it as a single, and his reservations are founded; unlike Buckley’s best, “Yard of Blonde Girls” sounds carbon-dated to the mid-’90s. “Nightmares by the Sea” fares better, its foreboding atmosphere and quicksilver arrangement finding a midpoint between Grace’s flowering darkness and something more sinister—twist your ear just right and you can almost hear St. Vincent coming up with something similar now. And like many tracks on Sketches, “Nightmares” can be hard to hear, filled with eerie lines like, “I’ve loved so many times and I’ve drowned them all.” But then, Buckley always used water imagery in his songs. It was an elemental fear for him, something he could not wrap his hands around. So instead of enacting some sort of death wish by wading into the Wolf River—as some have suggested—he could have been finally overcoming a phobia. As for these songs’ scenes of death, that was typical for Buckley as well. As in any important drama, the stakes were always high in Jeff Buckley songs—he fashioned himself a poet, a seer, a gothic diva. Music was his life, so echoes of death were inevitable. He was always running away from them. “My opinion was that the guy was much better without the band,” Verlaine has said of Buckley, and Sketches bears this theory out. The most beautiful moments occur when Buckley lets himself be beautiful, something he was loathe to do after his high cheekbones, intense stare, and luscious vocals turned him into alt idol following the release of Grace. But these songs aren’t mere retreads—they’re more creepy than consoling. “Morning Theft,” “Opened Once,” and “Jewel Box” are all love songs, but they flutter, never quite landing on a resolution. They are lyrically surreal, dancing around a romantic elusiveness that fuels so much great songwriting. “New Year’s Prayer” is similarly low-key, a mantra between light and dark inspired by Buckley’s infatuation with Sufi devotional music, while “You and I” comes off like an unsettling plea from a damp forest in the middle of the night. The song hints at yet another future for Buckley: as a Scott Walker-type ghostly menace throwing shadows around his unearthly voice forevermore. Perhaps the most surprising song on the album is “Everybody Here Wants You,” a straight-up R&B number that could sit comfortably aside hits by the era’s neo-soul stars like Maxwell and Erykah Badu. Buckley wasn’t happy with the song, thinking it was too much of a pastiche. He’s probably right, but it’s wild to think that he could toss off such genre-tourist brilliance at will. The four-track demos, by nature, are frustratingly unfinished, and they require a special sort of imaginative listening to hear what could have been. With its bittersweet resignation and one of the better hooks Buckley ever put to tape, “I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby (If We Wanted to Be)” has traces of a rock radio hit; “Murder Suicide Meteor Slave,” with its careening structure, ugly discordance, and self-lacerating lyrics, barely has traces of a song. One of the most intriguing demos, “Gunshot Glitter,” was wrongly turned into a bonus cut but is worth seeking out—riding a steady DIY bass thump, it hints at flamboyant dance rock decadence, as Buckley playfully deems himself a “paranoia politician diva.” The song had the potential to encapsulate all sides of Buckley’s persona—the weirdo, the hopeless lover, the charming clown—into something that could pump both hearts and bodies. It hurts to know we’ll never hear it as it was supposed to be heard.Even if all had gone according to plan, and the finished My Sweetheart the Drunk was released at the end of 1997, it would have entered a shifting pop landscape. By then, the aggressive male wing of guitar rock was migrating from grunge to nu metal. Teen pop was on the rise, with Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls CDs flying out of chain stores while *NSYNC and Britney were still on the horizon. Hip-hop and electronic were ascendant as well, making the idea of a band of white guys with guitars seem increasingly quaint. There was an exception: Radiohead, whose frontman Thom Yorke counted Buckley as a major inspiration on his vocal style, released OK Computer the week before the singer’s death. That album pinpointed a lot of the anxiety and doom that Buckley was trying to put forward with his own music, but in a way that was epic and widescreen instead of insular and austere—it would have provided some tough competition in the howling-falsetto sweepstakes. Coldplay, perhaps Buckley’s most successful progeny, didn’t arrive until a few years later, essentially unspooling the singer’s complications for mass consumption. But, given his wariness of the mainstream and his quest to subvert expectation at every turn, it seems safe to say that Jeff would’ve hated Coldplay.Sketches ends with a solo performance of the standard “Satisfied Mind” that Buckley sang on the radio in 1992. It’s a song about maintaining a richness of spirit that everyone from Ella Fitzgerald to Bob Dylan to Mahalia Jackson has sung over the years, and he does it justice. “When it comes my time,” he sings, “I’ll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.” But in the context of this release—and the tragedy intertwined with it—the conclusion is too easy, too pat. By most accounts, Buckley’s mind was anything but satisfied when he passed. In the days before his death, friends say he was acting strangely, talking in code, making random phone calls to people from his past. He was also coming to grips with manic-depressive tendencies. All this doesn’t necessarily mean he wanted to die, but it does seem to indicate he was dealing with some serious issues. The volatile nature of Sketches’ four-track demos bear this out too. Plus, satisfaction was never this artist’s goal. He wanted to disrupt, even if that meant going against his most obvious gifts. Dissatisfaction was something Jeff Buckley had to grapple with for much of his life. It’s where he left us.\"],[22673,\"The Hamilton original cast recording recently passed half-a-billion streams on Spotify.  That’s billion, with a “B”: Try to think of more influential, beloved, and ubiquitous cast recordings in history—you will probably end up counting on two hands, maybe one. The music of Hamilton now sits directly in the center of American pop culture, and it has smuggled rapping—the unadulterated, information-dense kind that you can hear tripping from the tongues of the best MCs—into the ears of Dick Cheney and Mike Pence with it, for God’s sake.So why does Hamilton Mixtape exist? Hamilton doesn’t need any help crossing over, into hip-hop or anywhere else. In its best-case scenario, The Hamilton Mixtape is an afterthought, an asterisk or a curio for Hamilton obsessives. On it, a wide-ranging group of rappers and R&B singers reinterpret, or in many cases simply cover, the tracks from the soundtrack, which has been lightly reworked and retooled by a range of producers, with guidance from Questlove and assistance from J.

Wiz Khalifa is here. Oh, and Jimmy Fallon, too: he performs “You’ll Be Back,” the jaunty break-up song from King George addressed to the unruly colonies. Fallon starts with a painful joke about how he was classically trained, “and by that I mean I was trained by vocal coach Ed Classically.” Then he takes a breath and starts singing. Trust me: You do not want to be in the room where this happens. The guest list throughout is an assortment of marquee names and WTFs. Black Thought sounds tremendous and forceful on the rework of “My Shot,” but he’s followed by a plodding Joell Ortiz and a humorless Busta Rhymes, who stiffens back into barking-youth-basketball-coach mode once away from the relaxing influence of his fellow Native Tongues members. There’s a lot of huffing and puffing, a lot of faux-motivational bluster, not a lot of good writing. Lin-Manuel Miranda, who doesn’t show up on the song, is missed.Miranda does show up on one of the mixtape’s only original songs, called “Wrote My Way Out.” He’s joined by Nas, who sounds disengaged, cartoonish, and distant. Miranda, meanwhile, burns through the song’s tissue-thin noble-struggle atmosphere with a verse hot with details. “I caught my first beating from the other kids when I was caught reading\\/Oh you think you smart? Start bleeding,” he yelps desperately. Yes, his verse also contains the seven-ton-anvil clang of “My mind is where the wild things are\\/Maurice Sendak.” But he’s a performer, and his ability to convey rising desperation in verse is maybe his purest and clearest link to hip-hop.The Hamilton Mixtape shares one thing in common with its parent album: It is very, very long. But since it isn’t sequenced as a linear narrative, treating the show like a sort of greatest hits, you lose all sense of the knuckle-whitening tension that propels the original forward. Alicia Keys leeches the marital tenderness out of “That Would Be Enough,” turning an urgent and warm plea from a wife to a husband on a frightening precipice into something for torch-lighting ceremonies, as impersonal and pretty as a hotel lobby chandelier. By the time you get to Chance the Rapper, crooning the show’s devastating “Dear Theodosia (reprise),” you realize that The Hamilton Mixtape has managed to drain away the edge and danger from a Broadway show, a curious inversion and just more proof that you can’t Xerox Miranda’s inimitable work.\"],[22655,\"Many were first introduced to Chicago rapper Saba as another local artist in Chance the Rapper’s orbit: he was a standout voice on Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment’s Surf (with an uncredited verse on “SmthnthtIwnt”) and more recently he guested on Coloring Book’s “Angels.” Both songs create a decent-enough sample size to assess what exactly Saba is all about: spirituality. He isn’t just fascinated by religion and its role in black families and communities, he’s fixated on the human spirit and the soul, too—both in the eternal sense and the mortal one. His latest mixtape, Bucket List Project, is about the experiences we long to pack into one lifetime. “They ask me ‘why Bucket List?’’’ he raps on “California.” “You know the bucket list: I finally climbed the rock, made it to the top of the precipice\\/I came from the pessimism of inner city as it is,” detailing the obstacles he’s hurdled to come within arm’s reach of his dream. To that end, the mixtape encourages listeners and guests to find the spirit necessary to achieve their own goals before they die. Saba has always dealt in a hopeful optimism steeped in pragmatism. Chance’s joy overflows, rooted in an unshakable confidence that no matter what, we gon’ be alright. Saba isn’t always so sure about that, but he wants to believe it. His writing is more analytical, taking stock of everything from the flawed U.S. education system to his own value, grading on a weighted scale. On his breakout project, 2014’s ComfortZone, he recounted the observations he’s accrued living on Chicago’s West Side, revealing uncanny abilities to scrutinize and to self-assess in the process (on “401k” “All my niggas did time and got beat up\\/But I was never street enough to grow up and be a thug”). Bucket List Project, which shares similar sonic space, picks up where its predecessor left off, telling West Side stories that expose the runoff of American corruption. But with death seemingly lurking around every city corner, it wonders, openly, about impermanence, too.The imagery is overwhelmingly theological on Bucket List—paradise, demons, heaven, prayers, blessings, preachers—usually with intent to make sense of a chaotic natural order. He seeks an ear from anyone listening (human or divine), and solutions from anyone who has them. “Call Obama, Jesus, Yeezus\\/He can save Chicago from the demons and the deacons,” Saba raps sarcastically on the Noname-assisted “Church\\/Liquor Store,” a Common-esque hood log that notes the role community institutions play in creating a toxic atmosphere. The lyric pinpoints a very particular, and prevalent, response to social inequity: passing the buck. Saba doesn’t really offer any answers, either, opting instead to witness, but what he does offer are insights.Bucket List Project isn’t as complete a journey as ComfortZone, but for the much of its groovy runtime, it is superbly written and performed. Saba is a crafty storyteller who makes full use of his long memory and slithering wordplay. On the xylophone-laden “Stoney,” a ride in a new car becomes a time machine back to past journeys that helped to inform his present. Some of his lyrics have devastating impact. He can open wounds with one-liners as simply as “How you lonely in a room with God?” or “I wish I didn’t have to be famous to be important,” but he’s just as capable of rattling off a razor-sharp diagnosis like this one from “American Hypnosis,” a reliving of personal traumas: “Had to learn my mama depression wasn’t my own\\/Had to feel the pressures of the pessimism\\/Trying to convince me that realism was a better vision.”In Bucket List Project’s margins, Saba has several people, some of them notable Chicagoan musicians, sharing their personal bucket lists. Among them: Chance, Lupe Fiasco, guest Jean Deaux, and local rapper Stunt Taylor. One fan wants to go one-on-one with former Chicago Bulls guard Derrick Rose. Another wants to play soccer on rooftops in Tokyo. Deaux wants to smoke a blunt with Beyoncé and de-gentrify Chicago neighborhoods. It’s a wishing well filled to the brim with unfulfilled dreams, further exploring the underlying thesis that inactivity is, in a way, similar to death. One outro speaks to the core of that message: “Hailin’ from the West Side, nigga tryna make it to the Grammys...at least somewhere. Somewhere more than where a muthafucka been.” Bucket List Project finds Saba going somewhere specific: forward.\"],[22593,\"They may appear to be hardy and resilient, but music cultures are fragile things, threatened by drastic shifts in society and political climates. Tropicalia, for one, lasted less than a year in Brazil due to punitive measures like AI-5 instilled by the junta. Club culture in New York City was starved to near extinction in the 1990s by then-mayor Rudy Giuliani’s reinstatement of a severe and obscure cabaret law. And when a coup brought Thomas Sankara into power in Africa’s Upper Volta in 1983, he changed the country’s name to Burkina Faso and installed drastic changes, including a city curfew and a law preventing musicians from charging money for concerts. Almost overnight, the vibrant music scene in Bobo Dioulasso evaporated.Were it not for the vinyl records pressed (and photographs snapped) during the short-lived existence of post-colonial Upper Volta, there would be almost no trace of the rough-hewed yet honeyed music made by the Voltaic musicians of the 1960s and ’70s. After centuries of colonial, tribal, and political clashes, these decades saw a country only recently freed of French colonial oppression, struggling to find footing with their own slippery national identity (the region is home to over 60 ethnic groups). When Upper Volta achieved full independence by 1960, it marked the beginning of a rather peaceful time in the country, which allowed the cosmopolitan music scene a chance to take root and flourish. While Numero Group has a knack for unearthing micro soul scenes in U.S. cities and weird private press albums from dollar bins, the deluxe audio and visual packaging of Bobo Yéyé: Belle Époque in Upper Volta marks their first foray into the motherland. It also makes for a worthwhile exploration of the landlocked African country, oft-times overshadowed by neighbors like Mali, Ghana, and Niger.The influence of French colonialism is evident from the start. Upper Volta’s earliest orchestras took cues from a band comprised of French colonial businessmen and Western instruments like the guitar, trumpet, and saxophone. American R&B, rhumba from the Congo, and (as the title suggests) the yé-yé of French ’60s pop—the bands of Upper Volta drew on all of it. No doubt, the titan of African pop, Franco Luambo’s O.K. Jazz—from the Republic of the Congo and the biggest African star on the continent—had a considerable influence on one of the earliest and most prolific bands to arise in the new country, Volta Jazz.Founded by bandleader Idrissa Koné, Volta Jazz is one of the savannah’s greatest musical exports, releasing a full-length album and some 20 singles during their lifespan. Their output is collected on the first disc of this set and is boisterous and simmering in equal measure, drawing on their native Bobo heritage and mixing in the many rhythms from outside their borders—most crucially, the Cuban music that found its way into the country on 78s. The upbeat rumba “Air Volta” displays an exuberance that threatens to outstrip the fast pace, the horns and electric guitar racing around the hand percussion breakdown at the center of the song. “Mousso Koroba Tike” displays the stinging guitar tone of late ’50s American R&B transposed to a rollicking African polyrhythmic backdrop. Meanwhile, the gentle ballad “Djougou Toro” shimmers like a desert mirage, with Dieudonné Koudougou’s steel guitar rippling in ever widening circles.As the ’70s wore on, Volta Jazz member-turned-bandleader Tidiani Coulibaly groused that the ensemble had not evolved beyond their supper club tuxedos and repertoire to keep up with the changing times. And so, he broke off and formed his own group with five other Volta Jazz members called L’Authentique Dafra Star de Bobo-Dioulasso, who comprise the second album on this set. Dafra Star was a more nimble ensemble and ranged widely (even touring in Mali and Canada), utilizing the traditional timbres of the ballaphon and mixing it with Cuban tumba drums, the double-picked guitars of Zoumana Diarra and Soma Bakary, and electric organ. The tricky interplay of ballaphon, horns, and percussion on “Dounian” anticipates the kind of post-rock tropes that Tortoise would deploy decades and continents later, while “Si Tu Maime” is a slow-burner of a ballad with dramatic organ accents.Okay, heretofore unknown music—from a country we might not be able to easily pinpoint on a map of Africa—dusted off and compiled for consumption is no novel thing. And as much as I enjoy the groups here, I might sooner reach for sets from Franco, Balla et ses Balladins, Rail Band, Star Band de Dakar, or Golden Afrique for future listening pleasure. But where Bobo Yéyé excels beyond those is in how it widens our gaze, showing us not just the music of Upper Volta, but the people who got gussied up on a Saturday night to sweat and dance to it. In this way, it makes for one of the most personable African reissues of the past decade.Parallel to the establishment of Koné’s Volta Jazz group, his cousin Sory Sanlé got his hands on a camera and set up a makeshift studio, documenting the bands and their fans. Along with the 3xLP\\/CDs, Numero included an 144-page hardbound book of Sanlé’s black and white portraiture, which makes it an indispensable document. In the introduction, Sanlé writes that the Voltaic used to throw photographs of people away once they had died, thinking they were pointless if the person wasn’t present. But then there was a shift: “People began to understand that by looking at old photos, the person was recreated... without photos, it’s like nothing happened.” Sanlé’s intimate photos show his friends and neighbors as fierce and innocent, defiant and bizarrely posed, cool and ridiculous. They catch his subjects in the act of becoming. The participants of Upper Volta’s music scene dress up as soldiers, as distant cousins of the Jackson 5, as tribespeople, as gangsters and b-boys, as musicians trying on different identities, making their presence known, if only for the blink of a shutter. Were these their actual roles in society? Or were they just trying on costumes for play? In looking upon these stunning photos, it’s more fun to just enjoy the enigma of these individuals.Writing about the Mali photographers Seydou Keïta and Malick Sidibé last year in The New York Times, Teju Cole noted that such African portraits offered “a vivid record of individual people, largely shorn of their names and stories but irrepressibly alive… ripostes to the anthropological images of ‘natives’ made by Europeans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.” Cole added, “Something changed when Africans began to take photographs of one another.” That statement extends to Sanlé’s own eye, and the Bobo Yéyé collection as a whole. While their country’s golden age lasted less than 20 years, the look, attitude, and sound of the Voltaic remains, even if the culture that originally nurtured it is no longer.\"],[22627,\"For many groups, it can be just as difficult to grow out of a specific time or place as it is to shed the preconceptions attached to one hit track. Simian Mobile Disco, the production duo of James Ford and Jas Shaw, reached crossover success in the mid-’00s, as part of a brief yet strangely prolific microgenre that has been described as everything from “new rave” to the cringeworthy moniker “bloghouse.” Disappearing pretty much as soon as it was conceived, and despite giving birth to some fairly decent music, bloghouse, like so many frivolous electro genres before it, fell almost immediately out of favor with the tastemakers and cool kids who tend to be the arbiters of such things (consider that the Justice remix of Ford and Shaw’s previous band Simian’s most successful song somehow became the title of Zac Efron’s ridiculously uncool DJ drama We Are Your Friends). As a new decade began and EDM started to slowly encroach on mainstream electronic music, other acts that came up at the same time as SMD, like Justice, Kavinsky, Boys Noize, and Digitalism, began to lose their footing, their more pop-influenced aesthetic pushed out by a harsher, sweatier style of techno.The success of SMD lies in their singular approach to this problem. Instead of trying to hold onto the style of their defining debut, Attack Decay Sustain Release, and its relatively vocal-heavy, DJ-friendly string of dancefloor bangers, each of their subsequent releases has showcased a different side of their considerable analogue production talents. Their discography runs the gamut of what techno has to offer: Their sophomore release, Temporary Pleasure, harked back to the radio-friendliness of late-’90s big beat, whereas 2014’s Whorl was entirely recorded at an intimate show in Joshua Tree, CA and reworked as an experimental, improvisational piece. As it turns out, SMD’s initial wave of popularity was more of a happy fluke than a measuring stick for the rest of their career.Welcome to Sideways lies on the clubbier side of SMD’s output, but as more of an instrumental exercise in sustenance and restraint than the needle-drops and fist-pumps that have become synonymous with tech house. The album opens with the simple 4\\/4 beat of “Happening Distractions,” the building block on which Welcome to Sideways constructs its minimal melodies and heady, spacious sequencing. Good electronic music is almost always a method of addition rather than subtraction, and all of the tracks on the album begin as skeletal imprints of sounds and ideas before they take full form. Other early tracks like “Far Away From a Distance” and “Bubble Has No Answers” mimic the build-ups of SMD’s harder past releases but in a drawn-out and dream-like state—when the beat does drop halfway through these mini-odysseys, it’s muted and disconnected, like hearing a raging party from beneath a tranquil Ibiza swimming pool.However, this is far from a party record. Clocking in at just over an hour in length, Welcome to Sideways is a study in dance music rather than a practice, one of those albums where skipping to a desired track is useless, as its meant to be experienced as a whole suite. “Remember in Reverse” begins with a soothing loop that’s gradually overcome by stacked glitches and fades until it reaches soaring altitude, and the seven-and-a-half minute closer “Drone Follows Me Everywhere” is SMD at their most oppressive, one pounding beat layered with a lead blanket of dark synths. For an act that has seen it’s biggest dividends producing easily consumable techno-pop, this variation might seem like a risk, and if Ford and Shaw hadn't already built a sturdy reputation as analogue technicians, it would be. But SMD have been doing this for a long time, and know how to toe the thin line between hypnosis and boredom. This album may not be their most compelling release to date, but it remains the work of two uniquely complementary musicians set on an ever-evolving path.\"],[22555,\"Earlier this summer, a story began to circulate about “Shinrin-yoku,” a coinage created by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in the early ‘80s that basically translates as “forest bathing.” It’s not hiking or trail exploring per se (nor is it, as the name might suggest, stripping naked and bathing in a pile of leaves), so much as it is a meditation that provide its bathers “an opportunity to slow down, appreciate things that can only be seen or heard when one is moving slowly,” as one guide put it. He expects it to be a trend not unlike yoga in the future. Naturally, the documentation is sparse on the health benefits of “forest bathing,” though researchers have focused on the phytoncides given off by the plants, the so-called “aroma of the forest.”The emergence of “Shinrin-yoku” dovetails nicely with the most recent reissues of Wolfgang Voigt’s GAS project. It, too, draws on the image of the forest and the density of its landscape, perhaps even drawing its name from the vaporous, relaxing properties of said “aroma.”One of many of Voigt’s production aliases, GAS, ran for five years in total, producing four full-lengths and a handful of singles, before coming to an end in 2000 with Pop. At that point in time in the new century, there were dozens of projects that could be traced back to Voigt’s industrious, multifaceted genius—from the maniacal, Pantone minimal techno of Studio 1 to the gateway drug of Burger\\/Ink’s Las Vegas (one of the earliest German techno albums to see domestic release in the US)– but the vagaries of Voigt’s GAS project were hard to pin down. The intent of GAS—as Voigt stated in an interview from that time—consisted of seeming contradictions: “The aim is always pop and to bring the German forest to the disco.” Or to take the club into the forest. That synergy—between the natural and electronic, the ancient and modern, the metered and the untamed, the infinite and the temporal—came together and then disappeared.While nearly impossible to compile a linear chronology for his discography—which includes more than 160 albums and 40 aliases—in the intervening years since these pivotal albums were released, their influence has overshadowed his own prodigal body of work. So while the four original GAS records were boxed and compiled merely eight years ago, Nah Und Fern infuriated many fans in that each album was reduced to an edit on a single side of vinyl, cutting hours of music into just one hour. And so now we are being given the simply and monolithically titled Box: a deluxe set featuring ten pieces of vinyl (each album is now spread across three sides, with another piece containing his 1999 12,” “Oktember”), an art book of Voigt’s manipulated forest photos, as well as four CDs.Box presents Voigt’s vision in its most momentous physical document to date and is a fitting monument. But it also looks back and edits the history in such a manner that brings to mind fellow countrymen Kraftwerk, who disavowed their first three albums they made before hitting upon the technological themes of Autobahn. Box also functions similarly to William Basinski’s massive 9-LP box set from 2012, arranging his archive of crumbling tape loops in a post-9\\/11 world as The Disintegration Loops, giving bookends and a coherent narrative to a project that during its creation and lifespan did not always bear one.Originally, GAS was but one of Voigt’s innumerable pseudonyms, first arising in 1995 as a remix of his own sampledelic cover of T. Rex’s “Hot Love.” GAS may have ultimately been a defining quality of the moniker but it’s easy it also easy to hear in it an homage to T. Rex’s own languid “Life’s a Gas” and Voigt’s beloved glam rock. When he spun off GAS with its own 12”, it was decidedly more ambient, though there were bits of glam and disco still deeply embedded in the productions.That history is elided completely here. As Box now posits, GAS begins two years on with 1997’s Zauberberg. It’s the first instance of Voigt presenting GAS as a unified sound and vision. There’s a blurred photo of black trees bathed in a demonic red light on the cover, as if a forest fire blazes just out of frame, and the music itself reveals—and revels in—a far more somber tone. The glitter of glam is replaced with soot, as Voigt ventures further back in time, sampling and looping late 19th century-early 20th century composers like Richard Wagner, Alban Berg, and Arnold Schoenberg. Not that you can quite make out the motifs, as he slows such works until they become dirges, the crackle of the original vinyl casting off a campfire-like warmth, putting the techno producer on ground similar to that of experimental turntable manipulator Philip Jeck.The opening minutes of Zauberberg’s first track drifts through an indeterminate number of orchestral loops before dissolving into mist. They drift between drone and slowed melody, focal point and blur, foreground and background, sound and decay. That approach remained intact throughout GAS’ duration. As Philip Sherburne put it eight years ago, reviewing a rare live performance from GAS: “The point of GAS isn’t the moment or the riff; it’s the totality. I’d be unable to tell you the title of a given GAS track, or even the record.”Voigt had a lot of different approaches, so many that he had to keep switching aliases to contain them. For this particular project, Voigt only has one pitch, but it’s a doozy. His narcotic way with these loops, his ability to shift them in space, to slow them down even as the pulse beneath them intensifies, to ever-so-carefully alter the repetition so that it mystifies rather than lulls, remains unmatched. He muffles his telltale kick drum so that rather than shake a club's walls, it now seems to emanate from twelve feet under the forest floor. It’s as much a haunted memory of these nearly century-old classical recordings as it is a vague impression of last night's endless party, and as such GAS exists in a purgatorial state between the two.Despite spending nearly two decades with the albums, I’d be hard-pressed to distinguish the twenty-four tracks here. Mostly, the tints on each cover suggest the moods within. Zauberberg remains the most menacing, suggestive of being submerged in a lake or lost in the darkest hours of night. The next year, Königsforst—while still dark—suggests more glints of light. The amber glow on the cover is conveyed by the harps that plink across “II” and the majestic brass growling on “V.” Taking its title from the woods that Voigt himself grew up in, dosing on LSD as a teen and wandering amid the trees, Königsforst reconfigures Voigt’s memories as Brothers Grimm fairytale, seeing nature as an enchanted landscape.Pop ranges the farthest of the GAS albums, it’s opening moments warm and gurgling. Elsewhere, the swells are reminiscent of New Age music, which at the time was still widely scorned. The very next year, the chiming bells that bounce around on “IV” would become the foundation of Kompakt’s Pop Ambient sound. (In a strange twist, the A-side of the original “Oktember” single is replaced here with “Tal 90,” a track credited to Tal and released on the second Pop Ambient comp, by far the gentlest GAS track on the set and an outlier in its use of guitar as its foundation.) By the time that telltale darkness returns for the last fifteen minutes of Pop, the project feels like a riddle closing in on itself, resolving on a note that’s both ominous and transcendent at once.Box both cements Voigt’s legacy yet it also threatens to overshadow it, collecting and solidifying a haunting body of work that echoes not just through techno, but all music as the 20th century came to its end. No other project of Voigt’s created quite as much of an obsession amongst its listeners. It’s possible to hear Voigt move through post-rock, modern classical, noise and electronic: Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Max Richter, Eluvium, Tim Hecker, Andy Stott, Sunn O))), the Orb (at least in the 21st century), the Caretaker, Jóhan Jóhannsson, the Field, most entrants in the annual Pop Ambient series, they are just a few of the modern music makers who imbibed these albums and realized their own work.Last year, Dr. Christopher Dooks published a paper\\/sound piece entitled “Lessons Learned in the Königsforst,” wherein the interdisciplinary artist trekked to the forest outside of Cologne, obsessed by the album that he’s used for years as a sleep aid, an album that “taps into something potentially universal to aid stress reduction, almost as a medication.” He goes on to compare Königsforst to the sound of hearing your mother’s heartbeat in utero, to the Buddhist practice of a walking meditation, to coming down off of drugs and our modern “hyper-aroused” state of existence, to the album being a possible treatment for PTSD. In chatting with Voigt about it, the producer said the project was “about childhood dreams and traumatic fantasies, about (drug) paranoia and very special trippy ‘inner ear’ tinnitus adventure worlds.” It’s a suspension of time in both its exploration of extended duration, as well as in blurring the sensations that inform childhood and intoxicated adult realms.Clocking in at over four hours, Box can still be a foreboding listen. Many might still only hear a migraine-level thump and the hiss around it, while others can behold the infinite depths of space that Voigt suggests between each beat, luxuriating in each lurch of ghostly strings. Nearly twenty years later, GAS still assaults our presumptions about electronic music. How can music that seems to be monotonous, so uneventful, also convey such beauty and clarity? Why take a slow walk through the forest when there is so much to get done on any given day?In explaining the health benefits of “Shinrin-yoku,” one researcher suggested that it’s not the aroma of the trees that gives such bathers a sense of calm, but rather from a sense of “awe,” be it astronauts gazing down at the earth, tourists taking in the Grand Canyon, or even a young man recalling the forest from his youth. The expanse and vastness of GAS reveals as much as the listeners are willing give to them, the level of attention and perception helping to create such awe. Whether it’s your first visit or a return trip into this world, the ability to travel into each track unaccompanied by Voigt yet find your own trail is part of what makes this music resonate decades later. In this way, GAS continues to confer such medicinal, even magical, qualities upon its visitors.\"],[22682,\"Viral bubblegum rap star and self-proclaimed “King of the Teens,” Lil Yachty first introduced his motley crew of young stooges, the Sailing Team, on the Summer Songs 2 posse cut “All In.” It was a bubbly team theme that could double as a nursery rhyme. “All my brothers with me!” he shouted in the intro. That distinction somehow excluded R&B phenom Kodie Shane, the crew’s sole female voice, and unequivocally its most talented member. Her short, sweet verse stood out brightly from the half-cocked joke raps, ending with confidence: “I’m tired of talking, can you cut my check?” Shane established herself early on as more than a wave-rider—she’s a rising tide lifting all boats. If Perry is Yachty’s first mate, then Kodie is their anchor. Following the breakthrough, her new EP, Zero Gravity, makes a strong impression.Born in Atlanta but raised in a Chicago suburb, Shane is a product of both nature and nurture. As a baby, she traveled on tour with her sister’s platinum-selling R&B group, Blaque, and later returned to Atlanta, where she recorded her first songs at 14. It was local guru Coach K—a manager of Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy, and mentor to Shane—who later introduced her to Yachty. For much of the past year, Shane has been toying with ideas and tinkering with form: Her 2060 EP, released in March, trended toward the productions of trap it-boys Metro Boomin and TM88 before randomly, dramatically turning to sample things like Rufus & Chaka Khan’s “Ain’t Nobody.” It was scattered, but it showed off the range and arsenal of a prodigious writer who has spent her life around musicians. A few months later, the sugary, genre-scanning Little Rocket explored Shane’s pop sense.A highlight of it all was 2060’s Yachty duet “Sad,” a candy-coated jam about unrequited love and the solace that can sometimes be found in bitter moments. Shane and Yachty are kindred spirits who pull the best out of each other, and their collaboration provided an important benchmark for Shane: the precise moment where everything clicked. It’s no surprise, then, that “Sad” resurfaces on Zero Gravity, which is, as its title implies, a study in weightlessness.Zero Gravity is a bite-sized compilation of old tracks and new ones, showcasing Shane’s seemingly limitless potential; it’s compact but full, animated yet balanced, marrying the buoyancy of Yachty (on a song like “Losing Service”) with the lucid journaling of Tink. She, like Tink, is a rapper and singer who blurs the line between the two (see: “A Ok”). But she’s far more explosive, with an impish warble that quickly morphs into a liquid falsetto, a playful chirp, or even a mopey whimper in a snap. This dynamism is obvious on the hook-heavy “Drip in My Walk,” which is the song most in-line with the Yachty canon here. She cycles through a few subtle inflection changes before settling for flat out exuberance, her natural state.Listening to Shane feels rejuvenating. There’s a very particular energy to some of her songs that replicates tumbling around in a bouncy house. But there can be a delicacy to them, too, when her writing ventures into mature(r), more thoughtful R&B. In any mode, Shane meticulously crafts tunes that stay with you. She has the nuanced ear for melody that continues to elude Yachty, but her hooks are equally infectious, as she unspools skipping refrains with sweet, almost chant-like variations. Shane is a more complete songwriter, too; her ideas find resolution, especially on “Drip in My Walk” and “Can You Handle It”—the former seeing an extended basketball metaphor through to the end. Still, she fits her team’s bubblegum aesthetic perfectly. Even as her songs constantly move, they’re easy to follow. Yachty may be the internet’s star of today, but all signs point to Shane as a star of the future.\"],[22679,\"The Syrian Civil War started five years ago, following the violent response of Bashar al-Assad’s security forces to protests in the southern city of Deraa. Nationwide opposition demanded Assad’s resignation, which was met by swift and violent governmental retribution. In the years since, the violence has widened to an unimaginable scope: a multi-front conflict with numerous international and domestic players vying for control or stability of the region. In April, a UN envoy estimated that as many as 400,000 have been killed as a result of the conflict, and millions of Syrians (some estimates say 11 million) have been displaced from their homes, becoming the subject of a global refugee crisis. In the election cycles of the past year, Syrian refugees have been used as a scapegoat by any number of demagogues to stoke fear in people that their communities and jobs will be threatened by a slow encroaching wave of “otherness.” Just two days after the British people chose to leave the European Union in a controversial referendum colloquially known as Brexit, in London at the Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall, Damon Albarn and the music collective Africa Express organized a concert with 50 musicians from the Syrian National Orchestra. (Damon Albarn recorded with the Syrian National Orchestra for the Gorillaz’ 2010 album Plastic Beach, beginning a longstanding love affair with the region’s music.) Many of the musicians in this venerable troupe have been scattered across the globe, stranded behind miles of red tape.The event almost didn’t happen. A week before the rehearsals for the concerts were supposed to begin, it wasn’t yet clear if the organizers were going to be able to get Schengen visas for the 50 Syrian musicians to secure flights. The Guardian mentions “dark rumors about desperate calls to British officials”; apparently Africa Express co-founder Ian Birrell chartered a Boeing 737 for the musicians.But it did happen, and the concert is finally being offered as an album. During a year when multiculturalism and globalism enduring a severe, sustained battering, the Syrian National Orchestra help prove that beauty, and true sublimity in art can exist even in the most pernicious and divisive of atmospheres. For those who celebrate the heterogenous, open-armed, and loving embrace of a global music community, this two-hour-plus concert one June night in the Royal Festival Hall represents a kind of small victory, as well as an incredible night of music. The musical canvas for the project is vast. There is a traditional string orchestra onstage, accompanied by players of Arabian instruments like the ney (a kind of flute), string instruments like the qanun, zither, oud, and kora. In front of this assemblage are performers like Damon Albarn, Julia Holter, Paul Wells, and more. One of the first things you notice, listening, is the gobsmacking virtuosity of the players involved. In the thirteen minute track “Al Dahleh,” stand outs like ney player Moslem Rahal and Feras Charestan on the Arabian lap harp display stunning technical prowess.  The performance is met with multiple ovations, and as an exercise in technical genius it is astounding. This group of players hadn't seen each other in years, and they cohere seamlessly.Elsewhere, Julia Holter’s “Feel You” (a track from her resonant 2015 LP Have You in My Wilderness) is transformed by the presence of the Syrian orchestra. Here, it is more than just a piece of lush orchestral pop; it is a cross-cultural paean, proving collaborators who don’t share the same worldly experience can radically transform a piece of art, often for the better. Damon Albarn told The Guardian when organizing this event he said he was disappointed by the rhetoric surrounding the crisis as a “homogenous shadow” to be feared. What he wanted to do with this event is to show an audience the “experience to humanity” that these refugees can express in their art. Some of these musicians still live in Syria, dodging danger so they can continue to practice. Defying all bureaucracy, borders, and strife, this concert and this orchestra proves that art at its very best is a grand gesture of empathy above all.  \"],[22657,\"Experimental producer and sound artist Yair Elazar Glotman has an unparalleled knack for wresting gold from uncomfortable sounds. With the album he released under the moniker KETEV in 2014, Glotman gutted the basic operating principles of techno. KETEV’s music is rife with vaporous rhythmic apparitions that resemble dance beats, even if you can't touch them physically. Likewise, on his 2015 album Études, released under his own name, Glotman basically threw his classical acoustic bass training out the window in favor of hacking the strings with the bow to make solemn dark ambient drones. And yet Études has a certain grace of form that even an untrained ear can readily trace back to classical music. With the debut of his new project Blessed Initiative, he ventures into even more forbidding territory. This time, Glotman, who works in sound installations and film scores, drew mainly from foley recordings. Blessed Initiative begins with a sound that resembles a huffing car muffler, digitally chopped up to create the sensation of air being sucked out of the listening space. On an instinctual level, the listener can't help but feel a sense of suffocation—an effect that Glotman plays up by introducing gurgling and splashing sounds. And when a human voice suddenly appears and gets choked away, it’s as if we’re listening to a person drown. It's gripping, astonishing, and nearly unbearable. “Jazz as commodity,” the album’s cleverly titled second track, deposits us in a similarly unsettling place. At first, the piece is completely devoid of rhythm or melody. We hear only a perforating sound—something like a door opening and echoing across the expanse of a parking garage. Glotman builds a beat out of multiple layers so that eventually it takes on the character of a heavy-footed creature dragging chains. “Xanax interlude (relax!)” features a stereo panorama of crunching sounds that might make Matmos shiver, bringing to mind the magnified acoustics of insects moving through soil, while “Delirium juice & taste of jewelry,” reprises the air-sucking and bubbling effects of the album's opening. The sensations induced by these works can be profoundly unsettling. Yet, as usual, Glotman’s brand of discomfort never loses its flow and, on repeated listens, even acquires a certain majesty. The history of experimental music is littered with records that give bragging rights to anyone with the stamina to endure them. Blessed Initiative doesn’t fit that mold. Much to Glotman’s credit, there are moments where he is utterly convincing at bringing the sound-installation experience to you. His skillful placement of natural (or at least natural-seeming) reverberation casts the composer as an architect, someone who could have spent hours drawing blueprints for these tracks as much as he spent working on the KYMA software system he used to generate and manipulate some of the sounds. Blessed Initiative would be intriguing enough based only on its visceral sense of physical pace. But there’s more dimension to Glotman’s process than that. You glimpse his vision most clearly in second half of “Delirium juice & taste of jewelry”; as dozens of wind chimes clatter, Glotman frames them as if they’re doing so in an indoor space, i.e: without wind. You end up with the distinct sense of having stumbled upon something magical, an unseen force bringing these inanimate objects to life. As with the rest of the album, Glotman scoops the music of any traces of human presence, which makes you feel as if there’s no one else around to witness this strange and beautiful event. Describing it is impossible, and no one will believe you, but you know you were lucky to experience something special—much like this album as a whole.\"],[22654,\"“Things here have changed,” announces a computerized voice at the end of Peace Trail, the scrappy and strange new album by Neil Young. The song is called “My New Robot” and it might be about a recent divorcee taking comfort in the presence of “Alexa,” the voice-activated feature of Amazon’s new household device Echo. But those four words at the end, which introduce a barrage of online sounds (requesting to swipe your card, enter your pin number, your mother’s maiden name) hint at the bigger picture behind the record. As a songwriter, Neil Young has always thrived in shaky times. Whether it’s the deflated hippy dreams of his mid-seventies Ditch Trilogy or the road-weary breakup anthems that comprised 1992’s Harvest Moon, Neil’s best work often feels like a gut reaction to turbulence.More than any album since 2006’s Living With War—the Bush-era treatise that called for impeachment and looked to Obama as a beacon of hope—Peace Trail is a product of its time. Its ten sparse protest songs address the dissemination of fake news, the mistreatment of America’s indigenous people, and the water crisis in Flint. As suggested by his open letter about Standing Rock, Young remains a vigilant and thoughtful observer, staying up to date on important issues and fighting for what he believes is right. And while the songs on Peace Trail are unquestionably timely and occasionally poignant, Young’s songwriting-as-immediate-response sometimes fails him. His musings throughout the album often scan as non-sequitur sentimentality (“Up in the rainbow teepee sky\\/No one’s looking down on you or I”) or just plain non-sequitur (“Bring back the days when good was good”). You get the sense his goal here was to finish the songs as quickly as possible (maybe so he could perform nearly half the album at Desert Trip Festival), when a few more days of editing might have resulted in a more powerful listen.The same hurried approach Young takes with the lyrics, however, actually benefits the overall sound of the record. After last year’s Monsanto Years, Young has ditched his Promise of the Real backing band, whose tentative roots rock recalled, at best, a small town Crazy Horse cover band. On Peace Trail, he’s accompanied by two session musicians who mostly make themselves scarce. Most songs feature only Neil’s acoustic guitar along with unobtrusive bass and delicate, brush-stroked drums. It results in an album that feels refreshingly unlabored and current. On two tracks, Young even adopts an Auto-Tune vocal effect (maybe something he picked up from jamming with D.R.A.M.?). On Earth, the bizarro live album he released earlier this year, the effect was used as a commentary on inorganic food; on Peace Trail, it’s no joke. In the nearly-spoken-word “My Pledge,” Young’s Auto-Tuned harmonies aid the inscrutable narrative (which seems to connect the voyage of the Mayflower with our attraction to iPhones and maybe also the death of Jimi Hendrix?) with a disorienting layered effect.Two of the most effective songs on Peace Trail happen to be the ones least directly associated with the headlines. “Can’t Stop Workin’” offers an insight into Young’s creative process, borrowing a chord progression from his estranged colleague David Crosby while also hinting at a possible reunion: “I might take some time off,” he sings, “for forgiveness.” “Glass Accident,” meanwhile, uses breaking glass and the dangerous mess it makes as a metaphor for lack of accountability in the U.S. government (“Too many pieces there for me to clean up\\/So I left a warning message by the door”). Even more than the disquieting, if distractingly literal, narratives of tracks like “Show Me” and “Indian Givers,” these songs examine Young’s values at this stage in his career and illustrate his strength in communicating his concerns. And while Young’s voice has certainly never sounded older than it does here, there’s something youthful about his energy. Besides the fact that his two-album-a-year-clip keeps him in pace with your Ty Segalls or John Dwyers, his music is guided by a restless determination to cover new ground and speak his mind. “Don’t think I’ll cash it in yet… I keep planting seeds ’til something new is growing,” he sings in the title track: it’s long been both his gift and his curse.\"],[22631,\"With their detuned guitars, plodding tempos, permanently downcast expressions, and hardware-store dress code, Soundgarden looked every bit the “grunge” part, at least on first glance. If your first introduction came, for instance, via the image of frontman Chris Cornell baring his chest on a dimly lit soundstage in the video for “Loud Love,” you could easily mistake Soundgarden for a bunch of oafs wading in the same tarpit where the brontosaur remains of Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin lay fossilized. In fact, at points on their 1989 sophomore album\\/major-label debut Louder Than Love, Soundgarden came off as a ham-fisted Zep\\/Sabbath mashup.Clearly, the band underwent a period of profound growth sometime prior to recording Badmotorfinger, the 1991 follow-up that captures the band clicking on all cylinders. In its breadth and execution, Badmotorfinger dramatically surpasses the band's previous work. (Just don’t judge by the even more oafish video for leadoff single “Outshined”). The album also sustains a level of focus, cohesion, and intensity that the band’s later, more varied albums lack. It is also the moment where Soundgarden’s unique four-way interplay comes into alignment in earnest, along with their collective sense of songcraft and ability to create atmosphere.In the oversized coffee table booklet that accompanies the seven-disc “super deluxe” version of this reissue, three dozen musicians offer their recollections, including Henry Rollins, Les Claypool, Vernon Reid, Kirk Hammett, Buzz Osborne, Dale Crover, Krist Novoselic, Tom Morello, Steve Von Till, etc, etc. High praise even comes from ancestral giants like Zeppelin leader Jimmy Page, Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, and Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson. The mental image of Lifeson cranking Badmotorfinger with his kids, as suggested by his notes, is probably the most endearing. Sadly, though, Mudhoney’s Mark Arm doesn't re-tell the story of how, on hearing the final mix for the first time, he sent the band a postcard with the disparaging note: “Fuck, you guys sound like Rush now.” Though Louder Than Love cemented the band’s appeal with metal audiences, Soundgarden had first struck a national chord among college radio deejays who were keyed-in on the band’s underground pedigree. After working with the iconic independent label Sup Pop on their debut EP Screaming Life in 1987, Soundgarden initially turned down major label offers to release their debut full-length, 1988’s Ultramega OK, on SST, the venerated indie imprint founded by Black Flag’s Greg Ginn. Those two releases in particular reflected the band’s affinity for underground\\/post-punk acts like Hüsker Dü, Bad Brains, and Sonic Youth.In the new Badmotorfinger liners, Jello Biafra likens Soundgarden to a cross between Zeppelin and Killing Joke. But it’s not like the post-punk influences jump out at you on Badmotorfinger. That’s because, by that point, Chris Cornell and lead guitarist Kim Thayil had combined their individual guitar approaches into a complex latticework that remains somewhat inscrutable even as it grips you. For every Badmotorfinger passage that makes you want to bust into a fit of air guitar—the unevenly metered, Sherman tank trudge that closes “Rusty Cage,” the blues-metal crunch of “Drawing Flies,” the quasi-thrash gallop of “Jesus Christ Pose,” etc.—the music is rife with ten times as many intangibles. To choose just one, then there’s the high-end ambient buzz that permeates the album from start to finish, imbuing it with a static charge not unlike the electricity one feels in the air when entire sky darkens under a massive storm cloud.Indeed, much of Badmotorfinger’s power resides in its suggestion of a violence that rarely erupts and offers little catharsis when it does. The best example can be found on “Slaves and Bulldozers,” a seething seven-minute crawl where Thayil spends most of the time strangulating his guitar strings for spasms of noise that almost seem to emanate from an inhuman source. If you've ever been rendered speechless by the sight of the ocean, stars, volcanic activity—anything that suddenly makes you aware of your minuscule place in the order of life—Thayil’s “leads” (if they can even be called that) surge with the same coldly neutral ferocity.Meanwhile, even when Cornell unleashes his famous throat-scraping roar on the line “now I know why you’ve been shaking,” the enormity of the music feels choked back rather than triumphant. In sharp contrast to other heavy music—which is mostly designed to take frustration out on external targets—Soundgarden's signature rumble doesn’t give you an athletic rush. All of that gnashing turmoil on “Slaves and Bulldozers” actually points inward, collecting in your muscle tissue as a kind of seismic potential energy. And when the entire band pulls back for Cornell to switch to a bluesy murmur before the song’s wailing climax, Soundgarden show a command of dynamics they simply hadn’t been capable of before.  As you listen more closely, it becomes increasingly apparent that none of the songs lend themselves to primary hues like “angry,” “sad,” or even “rocking.” In its most rousing moments, Badmotorfinger is anchored by a pensiveness that fosters daydreaming as much if not more than it gives you reason to bang your head. Fittingly, the album’s lyrics venture well beyond heavy rock’s typical purview: Where other bands would choose to emote more directly from the gut (or elsewhere), Soundgarden temper the attack of the music with painterly images Cornell delivers with Beatnik flair. On “Room a Thousand Years Wide,” Thayil’s refrain of “tomorrow begat tomorrow” extends the song’s ambiguously woebegone perspective over timeless eons. And though bassist Ben Shepherd’s “Somewhere” doesn’t quite disclose itself as a love song, the sense of romance is undeniable in lines like “From the likes of her\\/To the time of me\\/Like the moon to earth\\/Or the sky to sea.\\/Only we’re no longer\\/Allowed to be.”Badmotorfinger is also anchored by drummer Matt Cameron’s inimitable way of dragging the beat back while also smoothing-out Cornell and Thayil’s preference for uneven time signatures. Even on punkish uptempo bangers like “Rusty Cage” and “Face Pollution,” Soundgarden never simply barrel forward, switching gears on a dime and moving sideways with the dexterity of a prog act. (Hence Mark Arm’s Rush comparison.)With all four members stretching more than ever before, at several points the music verges on the transportive, head-trip vibe of space rock or psychedelia. On the dreamlike “Searching with My Good Eye Closed” swirls of guitar twine around Cornell’s voice, heavily draped in reverb to give it the weight of a mystical presence speaking through clouds. When playing together in a room, the band tended to lumber through the song—evidenced painfully by the bonus concert and demo versions included in the deluxe package.Speaking of which: The studio outtakes here may be interesting from a forensic point of view, but they’re basically glorified demos that lack the agility of the finished songs. And while the version of “Black Rain”—with lyrics that would later be refitted for the Superunknown hit “Fell on Black Days”—works as a curio, the song selection could have gone deeper to include the early version of “No Attention,” a tune the band attempted during the Badmotorfinger sessions before settling on a later version for 1996’s Down on the Upside.In its definitive form, though, “Searching with My Good Eye Closed” is the most dramatic example of Soundgarden’s ability to touch the otherworldly. If you listen very closely to the fade out, you can hear the last wisp of Cornell’s voice trailing off: It’s barely audible and lasts for just half a second before it's smothered out of the frame by the leaden trudge of “Room a Thousand Years Wide.” The same thing essentially happened with the band’s career two years later, when Soundgarden went on to sell five million and became alterna-rock household names with their next album, 1994’s Superunknown. Much like when a director known for working in black and white switches to color, the obvious change in palette is initially what dazzles about Superunknown.But as both albums have aged, you could make a case that Soundgarden actually accomplished more with the comparatively limited shading of Badmotorfinger. Listening back now it’s an album that would have sounded fresh and vital released at any time over the past quarter century. The band didn’t do the music any favors with that dreadfully dated “Outshined” video, but it doesn’t take long for Badmotorfinger to reveal itself as something far greater than a relic of its time.\"],[22683,\"The cover art for Relationships features a photo of an entryway, nearly every inch of its canary yellow walls covered in signatures, writing and drawings. The photo was taken inside of Nick Hook’s studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where the producer has recorded and worked with a laundry list of hip-hop and electronic artists over the years, including Run the Jewels, Young Thug, and Action Bronson. Relationships, his debut album, feels a lot like that studio must: a place where Hook endlessly tinkers as a constant stream of guests passes through, each leaving behind bits of their sound. In keeping with Hook’s penchant for collaboration, Relationships enlists an impressive roster of artists: the freshly Drake-co-signed 21 Savage, the Deftones’ Chino Moreno, electro wunderkind Hudson Mohawke and even the late DJ Rashad. To hear him tell it, Hook didn’t pay for any of these features, relying instead on the goodwill accrued through years of production and engineering work.Given the diverse company he keeps, it should come as no surprise that Hook’s debut is an eclectic listen. That said, Relationships manages to hang together surprisingly well, anchored in large part by Hook’s rhythmic and melodic sensibilities. Hook is a collector of vintage studio equipment and it shows: The sounds of analog synths suffuse these songs with warmth, while much of the drum programming has a tactile, human feel. Also old-fashioned is the manner in which Relationships was constructed: all of these collaborations were recorded in person at Hook’s studio, rather than cobbled together from emailed files.Clearly, Hook is a big believer in chemistry, and this collaborative spirit tends to bring out his best. Over the course of Relationships, Hook allows his guests to pull his sound in a number of different directions, ultimately showcasing his own versatility. “Gucci’s” pitches up emerging Atlanta rapper 24hrs’ vocals into cartoon-character territory, the end result sounding like a trap banger crossbred with early Kanye’s chipmunk soul. “Can’t Tell Me Nothing,” a bleak grime number featuring 19-year old London rapper Novelist, colorfully evokes London’s wet streets: Hook’s synths alternately patter like raindrops and howl like sirens as Novelist raps with hungry-upstart fury. “Another Way” arrives at funky body music by way of cosmic synths, while “All Alone” matches Makonnen’s late night tomcat croon with the proper shade of noir. Given 21 Savage’s involvement and its title, you can probably guess what “Head” is about; more surprising is how exuberant the song feels—bass drum hits that pop like confetti-filled balloons, skittering hi-hats, glimmering synth lines. It’s a genuinely fun song, one where Savage sounds delightfully out-of-place, like a dead-eyed hustler at a child’s birthday party.Relationships is bookended by two collaborations with the footwork pioneer DJ Rashad, culled from sessions Hook recorded with Rashad before his untimely death. Opening track “+ 3,” which also features DJ Paypal, has Rashad’s fingerprints all over it: classic house synths, a tug-of-war between a thudding low-end and rapid-fire hi-hats and a mantra-like chant, provided by Nasty Nigel: “Pull up\\/Back door\\/ID\\/Plus three.” Album closer “The Infinite Loop,” meanwhile, ends the record on a very different note. Good luck finding Rashad’s contribution in the folds of the impressionistic track, which builds up slowly over the course of eighteen minutes, guided primarily by washes of chiming, delayed guitar provided by Chino Moreno. Nasty Nigel returns here, with a brief, nostalgic verse that steers into the track’s dreamy atmospherics: “Copping 40s at the Wawa outside of Philly\\/I was only 14, kinda high, my uncle with me.” Even if it hardly sounds like a DJ Rashad song, “The Infinite Loop” feels like a fitting tribute, a contemplative remembrance of a relationship that animated Hook’s work, like so many of those on display here.\"],[22635,\"After spending fifteen years—nearly half of his life—writing, recording and touring with the Icelandic band Sigur Rós, composer Kjartan Sveinsson finally decided in 2013 that he was ready for something else. In his time with the band, Sveinsson was responsible for bringing classical elements to Sigur Rós’ music, but since branching out on his own he has leapt completely into the composing world. Beginning with an orchestral and choral piece performed (but never released) in 2010 called “Credo,” Sveinsson began to establish that he not only had an ear for beautiful melodies but also possessed the trickier skill of understanding of how to properly conjure grandeur. He followed that work with scores to two films by fellow Icelander Rúnar Rúnarsson, the austere Volcano (2011) and Sparrows (2015), as well as two collaborations with artist Ragnar Kjartansson, each of which showcased his ability to write for context and to match sight with sound. Der Klang der Offenbarung des Göttlichen, with a title loosely translated from German to mean “The Explosive Sonics of Divinity,” is Sveinsson’s third collaboration with Kjartansson, and by far his most substantive work yet. Unlike “SS Hangover” and “Take Me Here By the Dishwasher,” each of which were conceptual art pieces for which Sveinsson composed a durational accompaniment, Der Klang is a complete work, one that stands majestically on its own. Although structured as an opera, it diverges significantly from the form, featuring neither stage actors nor any kind of evident storytelling. Broken into four “acts” titled “Teil” I-IV, each piece was performed as an aural backdrop to a series of minimalistic, static sets designed by Kjartansson, with only subtle environmental changes to the set (flashing lights, burning fires, background colors changing) over the course of each’s running time. The sets’ visuals are elegantly designed but their simplicity belies the more complex beauty of the music itself. While there are no actors onstage, there are vocals across the latter three compositions, which in performances were delivered by a chorus located in the orchestra pit. And there is, if not a libretto a connection to a story, apparently inspired by Nobel Laureate Halldór Laxness’ novel World Light, but it is entirely impressionistic. World Light is about the life of a young poet seeking greatness whose expectations for success aren’t ever met, causing him to seek solace and and beauty in his own failure.“Teil I” stands out from the following three pieces, for being both the lone track without vocals as well as for its brooding and ominous mood. Kjartansson’s set for “Teil I” was a backdrop of a rocky sea bay on a dark gray night, with only waves moving across the screen, but the music adds its own suggested image to this tableau—a ghost ship approaching or departing slowly, perhaps. The seesawing string melodies slowly evolve into piercing glissandi so cacophonous it nearly shuts down the senses; its extreme simplicity only serves to enhance its power.The following two compositions illuminate the grey skies with rays of sunlight, however faint. “Teil II” begins with a funereal choral piece reminiscent of “Orphic Hymn,” from Jóhann Jóhannsson’s Orphée earlier this year. The vocal intonations continue unaccompanied for three minutes before being joined by a sea of violins and cellos, which gently provide counterpoint by infusing a delicate sense of hope into the proceedings. Though not exactly sunny, on “Teil III,” another orchestral-choral work, Sveinsson turns tentatively towards more optimistic stirrings. It’s curious that Kjartansson’s set piece is just a frame of a house burning down in the darkness of night, because it’s easy to imagine an entirely different visual—a film scene of hard-earned epiphany, maybe, a broken character realizing their lot and resolving to improve it. On the opera’s final evocative act, “Teil IV,” Sveinsson returns to this sense of human resolve of as our salvation. Beginning with a droning cello and wistful female alto, Der Klang’s closing piece speaks to the power of personal commitment in the face of struggles big or small. The chorus vocals soar as high as the strings themselves, surging like a tidal wave that mirrors the first piece, a wall of sound that is both crushing and somehow comforting.Der Klang boasts all the qualities we tend to associate with sweeping modern neo-classical—it's beautiful, reflective, sad. But to slap the commonly used “ethereal”  tag on it does it a disservice. Sveinsson has a light touch, but his work hits a deeper and more visceral level, permeating and lingering long after it’s subsided. Sveinsson has a preternatural sense of scale and pacing, and seeing how powerfully he can provide canvases for ephemeral pieces of art raises the question of how he would do trying his hand at something bigger: A traditional libretto-and-song opera, or to re-infuse his talents in the more open but anchored spaces of rock music. Whatever he does, he has already quietly announced himself as a major talent. \"],[22653,\"The Rolling Stones have been the World’s Greatest Rock ‘n’ Roll Band™ for so long that, over the past three decades, they haven’t had to worry about being an especially good one. Since the mid-’80s, they’ve been releasing forgettable records at increasingly protracted intervals, all while their ever-extravagant world tours have taken on the feel of a traveling Hard Rock Café resort—a glitzy simulacrum of a rock’n’roll show catering to those who can afford to experience it. Fittingly, earlier this year the band went from being a proverbial museum piece to becoming an actual one.The knock on the Stones isn’t that they’re too old to play a young man’s game—even at 73, Mick Jagger can still run laps around performers a third his age—but that aging has brought no greater depth or texture to their music. What the Stones have lost over the years is not their capacity for raunchy rock’n’roll, but their ability to invest it with purpose and meaning. Jagger and Keith Richards used to be among the best (and most underrated) lyricists in rock; their last album was called A Bigger Bang and kicked off with a tune that included a “cock” pun in the opening verse.However, the Stones’ new album is as introspective as we can expect them to get in 2016—even if it they are playing songs that are nearly as old as they are. Blue & Lonesome is a covers collection that pays tribute to the post-war Chicago blues that first got the Stones rolling and inspired their very name. And since then, the blues have served as the foundation the band can dig into whenever their sound threatens to turn too au courant, whether they were reacting to the hippy-dippy whimsy of Their Satanic Majesties Request with the sleazy acoustic struts of Beggars Banquet, or devoting a side of Black and Blue-era concert document Love You Live to Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon worship.But Blue & Lonesome represents more than just a back-to-basics mission, It’s the most honest music the Stones have released in years—not because the source material confers it with the patina of authenticity, but because the entire blues-covers concept is a tacit admission that they don’t really give a shit about being a contemporary concern anymore, so they’re just going to do something that feels good. (The record was reportedly spawned as a warm-up exercise for a postponed album of new material.) And now that the band are older than Muddy Waters or Howlin’ Wolf ever lived to be, they can fully inhabit the grizzled-bluesman archetype to which they've always aspired, and exude a genuine get-offa-my-lawn imperviousness to the modern world.Blue & Lonesome was bashed out in three days, and for the first time in eons, the Stones sound like a band playing together in the same room rather than one that travels on separate jets. Jagger is, naturally the star of the show—but not in his usual vampish ways. Whether he’s embodying the down-on-his-knees despair of Memphis Slim’s title track or playfully assuming the role of sad-sack cuckold on Little Johnny Taylor’s “Everybody Knows About My Good Thing,” his ageless voice sounds like it’s emanating from the middle of the band scrum rather than the lip of a catwalk. And while Chicago blues may have introduced the concept of jamming and guitar gods to the rock lexicon, Richards and Ronnie Wood’s grinding interplay ultimately plays a supporting role to Jagger’s harmonica honks, which cut through these songs like a rusty hacksaw with “Midnight Rambler”-worthy gusto.But as much as Blue & Lonesome plays it raw, it’s not all that raucous—the energy here is less rip-this-joint than rocking-chair steady. On paper, the idea of the Stones running roughshod over a set of classic blues tunes seems like a long-suffering fan’s dream. (The “best Stones album since Some Girls!” headlines practically write themselves.) However, what made the Stones the Stones wasn’t their purism—it was the sacrilegious impulse to corrupt their influences with their own singular swagger. But Blue & Lonesome is more about adhering to tradition than encouraging sedition. The Stones may be drinking from their fountain of youth here, but they’re content to just savor it rather than spit it back in our faces.On their best blues covers—Beggars Banquets’ “Prodigal Son,” Sticky Fingers’ “You Gotta Move,” Exile on Main Street’s “Shake Your Hips”—the Stones handled the songs like Ouija boards; they were less about paying homage to their heroes than channeling their sinister essence. Blue & Lonesome has flashes of that insidious inspiration: On the revved-up run through Howlin’ Wolf’s “Commit a Crime,” Jagger’s vocal oozes with implied violence overtop a repetitive, trance-inducing riff that rings like a police siren; on Little Walter’s “Hate to See You Go,” his pained baby-please-don’t-go pleas climax with an extended harmonica drone that threatens to swallow the song whole.But for the most part, Blue & Lonesome doesn’t aspire to be anything more than a good-time frolic among old pals (Eric Clapton cameos included), with the interchangeable, upbeat takes on Buddy Johnson’s “Just Your Fool” and Eddie Taylor’s “Ride ‘Em on Down” more conducive to knee-tapping in a seated supper club than tearing the roof off a juke joint. For an album rife with tales of heartache, duplicity, and death threats, it’s positively brimming with bonhomie. And, hey, given all the shit-talking Keith did at Mick’s expense in his autobiography, Life, that audible camaraderie is something of a minor miracle in and of itself.  On its own modest terms, Blue & Lonesome offers promising proof the Stones can still be a band instead of a brand.\"],[22672,\"On his recent Hot 97 appearance with Funk Flex, Gucci Mane noted his immense desire to work with new artists that had risen during his time in prison. He name-dropped Lil Yachty, Dae Dae, 21 Savage, and, of course, the partner he collaborated on this new mixtape, 1017 vs. the World, with: Lil Uzi Vert. “Anybody who hot, and the kids say he hot, I think it’s hot” Gucci told Flex. This kind of talk would fit in nicely at any music label boardroom, but because it comes from Gucci Mane, a street-rap elder statesman with a proven track record of promoting and influencing new rappers—particularly in Atlanta—you trust that it comes from a good place. Gucci has been making good on his promise and, with the fourth project of his to be released in 2016, 1017 vs. the World brings Gucci’s slower tempo and aggressive style together with Lil Uzi Vert’s anime-tinged eccentricity and goofiness.Beyond Gucci’s desire to connect with a younger audience and make music with a young upstart, there’s not much of a meeting point between these two. Uzi is so elastic and cartoonish that it makes the already-traditional trap style of Gucci feel even older by comparison. The tape is certainly not bad, but the chemistry of collaboration is absent: The songs that work best for Gucci’s mellow, bass-heavy nonchalance don’t work as well as for Uzi because he sounds reined in, and the songs where Uzi bounces off the walls in his Nicktoons rockstar manner get bogged down by Gucci. They have a Who Framed Roger Rabbit dynamic, where Uzi is the elastic Roger and Gucci the plodding Eddie Valiant.There is something intriguing about the sound of Gucci's voice on Honorable C Note’s candy-colored beats, like the opening “Changed My Phone”; it doesn’t fully work, but you can feel him trying to work with a sound outside of his own. Gucci shines most when the sound is on his terms, such as in the Mannie Fresh-produced “Blonde Brigitte”; a heavy, sluggish record where Gucci can rap with adoration about “a black girl with blonde hair, green lipstick she look like a rainbow.” Uzi’s spastic irreverence, meanwhile, is better-served on the video game soundtrack production of “Today!!”The roster of producers on this brief tape is eclectic, but they can’t bridge the generation chasm. Since returning from prison, Gucci has sounded hearteningly strong if rarely inspired, and the implied madness that sparked much of his best material, from 2008 to 2010, has dissipated. It might have served him next to Uzi's playfulness and flippant disregard of masculinity, his “diamonds on my choker” and “I was watching Food Network and learned how to make the cake.” Uzi isn’t that far removed from Future or Young Thug, both frequent Gucci collaborators, but the difference between Uzi and Thug is that Thug came up under Gucci's tutelage. Thug is still a student, whereas Uzi has no connection to his elder, and it’s evident.\"],[22536,\"In the beginning, New York’s White Material label prized an ethos of function over form, packaging gruff, no-frills techno in plain white sleeves. Their logo depicted a hard-hatted technician strapped to a telephone pole: “Working man’s techno,” read a phrase stamped on the label's first release. (There is an element of fantasy at work here; a few of the label's artists are RISD grads, and at least one works by day as a graphic designer.) None of the crew’s members stripped his records more mercilessly to the bone than co-founder Young Male, aka Quinn Taylor, who came up with the label’s slogan during a stint working in a hand tool factory. As recently as September, when he released Hot for Destiny and the Street, his second full EP for the label, Young Male was still applying himself primarily to stern, basement-quaking floor-fillers. His peers, meanwhile, had developed distinct musical identities: Galcher Lustwerk became known for his barbiturate house beats and hypnotic baritone; DJ Richard’s debut album, for Dial, put a chilly ambient spin on techno. Both producers’ music is unmistakable for the work of anyone else, but Young Male’s minor-key throb felt ego-free, a kind of ur-techno that was less about authorial genius than collective release: DJ tools meant to keep dancefloors running smoothly.Now, though, with his debut album, Taylor makes his own pivot toward auteur status. How to Disappear in America sounds unlike anything he’s done before. This is not a dance record. The tracks are short and sketch-like. The tempos are slow, the lighting crepuscular. A few tracks feature no beats at all, and when percussion does appear, it’s a rickety pitter-pat pulse that sounds as cutting-edge as the home organ in your great-aunt’s living room, and as hard-hitting as the tapping fingernails of an ASMR video.John Carpenter and Alan Howarth’s influence looms large over the record’s pensive pulses and gravelly pedal tones. How to Disappear in America resembles a soundtrack in other ways, too. Its titles read like film cues (“Franklin’s Theme,” “Into the Night,” “Fade”) and its pursuit of atmosphere is all-consuming. It is resolutely minor-key, and his analog synths have a bitter tinge to them.Occasionally, a pinprick of light punctuates the murk. “Muzak” makes surprising use of fretless bass and oily tenor saxophone, evoking the glass bricks and neon lights of a decades-old softcore video found in a discarded box of VHS tapes. And while “Carrier” is little more than a gloomy bass pulse buffeted by a cold, unforgiving wind, there's a hint of the Durutti Column in the silvery guitar line that sprouts from it like a sturdy desert cactus.Mostly, though, bleakness predominates. “Into the Night” channels the drone of bomber jets into a short, sinister ambient sketch, and “Franklin’s Theme” wraps its hi-hat rhythms with a coppery and noxious monotone. “Reveal (Pacific Coast Highway 1 Version)” is strikingly reminiscent of the Cure’s “Carnage Visors,” the soundtrack to a film the band opened their concerts with on 1981’s Picture tour.That song, reissued on the expanded edition of Faith, stretched a single riff into a 28-minute dirge, and Young Male’s short, funereal album—itself just 28 minutes long—functions in similar ways. Almost claustrophobic in its cohesion, it sounds like it was made using only a handful of obsolete machines, and the manner in which it worries away at the same few sounds and themes suggests a certain weary fatalism, a sense of running out of options. In Young Male’s America, all roads are dead ends.\"],[22676,\"Los Angeles songwriter Alex Izenberg describes his debut album as the culmination of five years of writing and recording, which is a long time for a record that feels like the product of a few casual studio sessions. A modernist spin on the ’70s singer-songwriter album, grounded in the same evergreen themes of longing and heartache, Harlequin often seems torn between its ambition and its nonchalance. At times Izenberg shows flashes of Van Dyke Parks’ compositional bravado, but just as often he handicaps himself with Dollar Store chamber-pop accompaniments. He can’t commit to going big, but he doesn’t want to go too small, either.  Mostly, it seems, Harlequin just wants to sound different, and on that front it succeeds. Following in the freak-folk tradition, it never goes too long without an idiosyncrasy: train horns, found sounds, long pauses, blank spaces, and other apparent studio mistakes that are almost certainly more deliberate than they pretend to be. The tropes themselves aren’t especially new, but the way they’re all shuffled together is, and Izenberg is confident enough in the originality of his final product that he directly credits his influences. Instead of downplaying his debt to Grizzly Bear on waltzier pieces like “Archer” and “Changes,” Izenberg leans into it, adopting Daniel Rossen’s top hat-doffing swoon as a kind of homage.  Elsewhere, Lou Reed gets a nod on the choppy cabaret number “To Move on” when Izenberg borrows his “Rock & Roll” phrasing to describe dancing to that “fine, fine music,” although it’s Reed’s Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale who looms even larger over the record. Austere violas and cellos lend an undercurrent of doom to a series of stormy, impressionistic pieces like “Libra” and “The Farm,” which tease the full-scale orchestral album Izenberg might have made instead.  Listening to Harlequin, it’s hard not to wonder if the record would have been better off if Izenberg had gone all in on those arrangements, since the album always stops just short of genuinely wowing. Where Parks, Rossen, and Cage never disguise how much effort they’ve spent meticulously piecing their components into intricate works, Izenberg would rather give the appearance that he just poured a jigsaw puzzle box onto the table and accepted the patterns that formed. That approach sometimes scans as insecurity: Harlequin often feels like a pretentious album afraid of being called pretentious.   The record’s best numbers are those rare ones when the adornments take a back seat to the songs themselves. On the early highlight “Grace,” Izenberg laments losing himself in a misguided crush, and lands one of the better forehead-slap lyrics this side of Rivers Cuomo’s “I’m dumb, she’s a lesbian”: “Darkness had taken over me,” he sings, “Once I’d seen her engagement ring.” And on “Changes,” his struggles as both a romantic and a songwriter converge when he confesses, “It’s getting real hard to talk about her to anyone.” The album could use a few more moments like that, lines where Izenberg comes across like the kind of relatable guy you might want to trade tales of heartbreak with over a beer. Yet for a record so guarded, it’s almost always personable—even its most difficult songs, like the avant sound collage “A Bird Came Down,” have a gracious, likable quality (it helps that he keeps them short). Harlequin is an odd album with perplexing priorities and a conflicted sense of scale, but just enough sweetness and heart to make you want to give it the benefit of the doubt anyway.\"],[22671,\"By now, the world knows who Donald Glover is. From “Community” to the sharp and universally beloved “Atlanta” to his forthcoming Star Wars role, he’s carved out his persona; he’s likable, sensitive, and observant, the self-aware everyman. But Childish Gambino has always been harder to pin down. Since emerging with throwaway mixtapes under that alias, Glover has released two highly self-reflexive rap full-lengths, a Southern rap EP and a straight pop EP, and hosted a mysterious, cell phone-free festival. The unifying thread connecting all of this has sometimes been hard to spot. His recently released “Awaken, My Love!” is his hardest left turn yet, ditching rap wholesale in favor of funk worship, and the result is his most enjoyable project to date. In paying homage to heroes, he even hits upon some of the genuine emotional connection that has often been missing from his music.The album’s production is majestic, aiming squarely for the cosmos depicted on its striking cover artwork. Like the cosmic soul it emulates, the atmosphere is lush, full of period ambiance worthy of a high-end television set. The album’s first track and lead single, “Me and Your Mama,” is a satisfying slow burn that shows off Glover’s impressive falsetto. Its imagery (“This is the end of us\\/Sleeping with the moon and the stars”) might be vapid, but the intensity of Glover’s singing compensates, as does the ripping electric guitar.The tracks are embellished with intricate details throughout, like the delicate xylophone on “Terrified.” “Redbone” builds from a slow jam into a peak of futuristic guitar and forceful staccato piano chords. It’s a love song, which has always been Glover’s forte, whether on Because the Internet’s “3005,” “Telegraph Ave,” or Camp’s “L.E.S.” The same goes for the open-hearted “Baby Boy,” possibly inspired by the birth of his son. These songs dig into something that feels unique to Glover’s heart, not just his record collection.Too much of the rest, though, simply nods to sentiment without producing any. On “Have Some Love,” he limply advises the audience to “really love one another.” The song called “Riot” isn’t exactly riotous: He screams a little, but only for the sake of fulfilling a pre-ordained funk yelp quota—nothing in the song seems to have moved him to shrieking. There are also a few indistinguishable tracks that feel like funk retreads; “Have Some Love” sounds uncomfortably close to “Can You Get to That” from Funkadelic’s Maggot Brain. “California,” a cringey tropical parody complete with fake patois, sticks out for the wrong reasons. It sounds like “Kokomo” for the “Hotline Bling” era, or maybe Ween covering Sublime’s “Caress Me Down,” and its inclusion is entirely baffling, considering the sonic cohesion of the rest of the project.Donald Glover’s greatest talents remain his tragicomic touch as a screenwriter and his ease with performance. He’s skilled enough to figure out how to excel at something, and, for the most part, look like he knows what he’s doing. As a rapper, he almost sounded the part: Take a step back, and there he was, rapping fast, switching up flows, delivering (too many) punchlines. But zoom in, and it didn’t really click. Rarely did he make a song about anything, and those zingers were plain obnoxious. (“Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie” from a 2012 track with Danny Brown, for example.) That same on-paper ability is what makes “Awaken, My Love!” a well-executed project: He has clearly absorbed a great deal of musical history, as the album nods to Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone, Rick James, Prince, and more. There are times, however, when that nodding feels more like mimicry than anything else. Maybe he’ll figure out how to smuggle Donald Glover’s heart into Childish Gambino’s brain eventually, but if he hasn’t figured out what he wants out of Childish Gambino yet, it’s increasingly rewarding watching him try. \"],[22675,\"New Jersey rapper Fetty Wap reached complete cultural saturation with his surprise hit “Trap Queen,” a love story with a crack core that swept through suburbs and schoolyards all the same. Before long it was getting Vox explainers and an Ed Sheeran cover, and then Fetty was singing it on stage with Taylor Swift at stadiums. It charted in the Top 10 in Belgium and Denmark. His success ballooned enough that he started crossing milestones only held by megastar rappers like Lil Wayne and Eminem: Three songs charted in the Billboard Hot 100’s Top 10 and three in the Top 20. But a fourth single never caught hold, and soon he was making a mixtape with French Montana, Coke Zoo. This February, he received a few cursory Grammy nominations and his self-titled debut was finally certified platinum, but his visibility was waning. By August, he was guest starring on “Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood,” alongside Nicki Minaj’s spurned ex Safaree Samuels. Ubiquity can be a fleeting thing.It isn’t the most precipitous decline in rap history or even the most unusual rap career arc for a would-be star, but it would appear Fetty Wap is nearing a crossroads. What Fetty does next is crucial to whether or not he sustains his success, or just becomes the “Trap Queen” Guy. Though promising sales and streams for his debut appear to indicate a healthy base eager for a proper follow-up, it’s just as likely that the album was merely the beneficiary of the house of mirrors that is “album-equivalent units.” His latest release, Zoovier, is a 19-track sampler mixing his trap balladry with more traditional trap bangers. To avoid a Fetty Wap retread, there is significantly more rapping, which, unfortunately, produces more than his fair share of bars like “Bitch I’m Papa Smurf, I got my money right\\/Got a Super Soaker for her water ride.”But if you wade through some of the cringy lyrics (on “King Zoo”: “I put the molly in her shit hole\\/And watch it light up like a disco”), the straight-up boring ones, the more grating moments, and the lulls here or there provided by songs like “Bad Lil Bitch,” there’s a more compact offering that recalls his most invigorating uses of Auto-Tune and his most charming performances. A song like “Instant Friends,” with its harmony fills and subtle come-ons, is magnetic in its delicate use of social cues, yet it’s lined with DM-violating blunt talk. “Don’t Love Me” and “Hate You,” a pair of gummy synth delights, are perfect complements, in sound and subject. The only true ballad on the tape, “Shorty,” is a reimagining of Plies and T-Pain’s “Shawty” that is as much an exhibitions for the ad-libs as it is for his full-bodied croons.When it hits, Zoovier is a reminder of just how malleable Fetty Wap’s voice is, flipping from flirtatious to tender to outright lovestruck in a blink. But this is a bloated release that doesn't play to those strengths enough, and his boasts all start to run together after a while: exotic cars, exotic women, having sex with exotic women in exotic cars. It isn’t just that he’s a ball of rap cliches; it’s that he doesn’t make any of them seem fun. Fetty isn’t a very imaginative writer, and he relies primarily on feel, so it’s odd that he would intentionally tie one hand behind his back with so many melody-less raps.  Zoovier is further evidence that Fetty is best (and perhaps solely effective) as a trap romantic. Why ruin a good thing? If this tape is some kind of beta test for the Next Gen Fetty Wap, here’s hoping he opts to just stick to the formula that swept the nation.\"],[22680,\"Miranda Lambert’s music has always existed in extremes. Throughout the Texan’s previous five albums, she has established herself as a no-nonsense country-pop troubadour whose response to emotional turmoil could be separated neatly into kerosene-fueled revenge fantasies and “American Idol”-ready torch ballads. Right from the start, however, it’s clear that The Weight of These Wings is a different type of album for Lambert. “I’m looking for a lighter, I already bought the cigarettes,” she sings in “Runnin’ Just in Case,” the album’s majestic opening track. It’s a subtle lyric, but it’s indicative of her change in perspective: to put it simply, finding the fire has never been the problem for Lambert. Alas, things have changed.Although it arrives in the wake of her high-profile divorce from Blake Shelton, The Weight of These Wings is a breakup album refreshingly devoid of spite or anger. Instead, it’s a thoughtful concept record, more focused on moving on and growing up than lashing out or telling all. Throughout its twenty-four songs, Lambert analyzes herself and her choices, often while on the road: It’s more Hejira than Blue, more “Shelter From the Storm” than “Idiot Wind.” The pensive tone of the lyrics is reflected in the album’s stark, unglamorous production. Despite coming from one of the highest-paid, most successful country artists on the planet, Wings makes precious few ploys for pop radio. There are no millennial whoops or 1989 synths. Instead, the album is distinguished by a rootsy stomp akin to Tom Petty’s Wildflowers—another long, post-divorce statement that used its sprawl to mimic the messy mental state of its creator.While Wings is a double album in the traditional sense (it’s a good seventeen minutes longer than Metallica’s recent one), it does away with the clutter usually associated with the form. The album’s most experimental track is also its most traditional—the pitch-perfect classic country of “To Learn Her”—and it’s most throwaway moment, an easily editable false start to the groovy “Bad Boy,” is charming and self-aware. The mood throughout the album is staggeringly consistent, and its separate halves (titled “The Nerve” and “The Heart,” respectively) feel like less a means of distinguishing their sounds than identifying their subtle shift in tone. While “The Nerve” finds Lambert losing herself in travel (“Highway Vagabond”), drinking (“Ugly Lights”), and a pair of cheap sunglasses (“Pink Sunglasses”), “The Heart” is less hell-bent on escape. In “Six Degrees of Separation,” Lambert flees to New York City only to be haunted by an ad for a litigation attorney, plastered across a bus stop bench. Such is the narrative of The Weight of These Wings: the landscape of America starts to resemble your mental geography the more closely you identify what you’re looking for.Even with the tremendous growth Lambert shows as a songwriter, she remains true to herself and her past work. The choruses still arrive precisely when you want them to. The references are cozily predictable (getting “on the road again” requires a Willie Nelson namedrop, naturally). “Kitchen sink” still rhymes with “diesel tank.” And Lambert maintains her trademark style of country-girl self-mythologizing in a way that feels both fresh and funny. In the boozy garage rock of “Ugly Lights,” she’s “the one who doesn’t need another one,” begrudgingly bumming smokes to folks younger and more sober than her. In “Vice,” one of at least five tracks on the album that feels like its show-stopping centerpiece, she leaves town simultaneously spitting in its face and winking at the camera: “If you need me\\/I’ll be where my reputation don’t precede me.” While Wings is hardly a showcase for any kind of vocal gymnastics, Lambert’s voice remains the star throughout. She can switch from a soulful vibrato in “To Learn Her” to a scratchy howl in “Pink Sunglasses” with equal confidence. She drawls with eerie detachment in the snappy “Highway Vagabond,” which sounds a little like “Send My Love (To Your New Lover),” if Adele was less interested in letting go of her ghosts and more in letting them ride shotgun. “Get off one and get on the other highway,” she sings in the chorus, “Well if we ain’t broke down then we ain’t doing something right.” It’s a sentiment that’s echoed in the album’s closing song “I’ve Got Wheels,” when Lambert’s endless driving sounds like self-empowerment: an excuse to move forward. Alone at the wheel, she sounds steady and weightless, like she finally knows where she’s going.\"],[22641,\"“open wide.,” the first video from Denitia and Sene’s second full-length album, oscillates from oversaturated white daylight to bleary nighttime shots of the group. Shot by Brian Marc (Sene’s an alias) that filmic quality carries over to the Brooklyn duo’s music, which renders spare, low-lit R&B with its elements bleeding together or blurring just out of focus. Three years have passed since their debut introduced their fuzzed-out trip-hop\\/soul, and it wasn’t easy to sort what they were up to at the time. love and noir. continues along the future R&B template they introduced on His and Hers., more often than not favoring a simmering, slow-moving pulse that falls closer to the pace of a resting heartbeat than almost anything else on modern R&B radio.That deliberate pacing gives opener “favorite.” a gentle feel, weary but calmed, befitting the song’s theme, when the other half has returned from a long day’s work. Synth brass bubbles up and finger snaps accentuate the bass throb, as Denitia admits: “My favorite part of the day is when I see your face\\/I know it sounds cliché\\/But when I see your face\\/Everything’s okay.” But even though the lyrics acknowledge their own triteness, they don’t quite escape it. The album explores love, doubt, and the pins and needles in between, territory that R&B has traversed for decades. But despite delving into the shadows of love, the duo too often stretch their imagery to the breaking point. “strung.” twines a halting beat and deep bass wobble to a prickly guitar lick that get layered to the point where it approaches shoegaze-thick fuzz. A deft bit pizzicato strings blips up midway through, but listen to the lines about being “torn at the seam” and said strings belabor the metaphor running through the track, which asks: “Whose strings have you strung?”Denitia and Sene are adept when it comes to establishing a seductive mood for the length of a song, but over the course of this twelve-track album, it turns sluggish. “roulette.” warns “don’t try this at home” against a muffled kick that never rises above the haze and long stretches of the album feel lethargic. “open wide.” remains the highlight of the album, achieving a balance between ’80s anthemic balladry and ’00s R&B noisiness. Only as the album draws to a close do the slow tempos  gain traction and push forward the songs. “alone.” finds Denitia toggling between defiant and forlorn against a slippery breakbeat and pleading guitar. “How far can we go?” the duo harmonize on closer “too far.”, Denitia’s voice reaching a poignant note;. But just as the mood settles in, the beat fades away before the three-minute mark and casual chatter takes over, like a door opening from a darkened studio back into daylight. \"],[22645,\"John Legend doesn’t waste time getting to the point of Darkness and Light, his fifth solo album. On “I Know Better,” the record’s gospel-infused opener, the singer refutes the celebrity he’s acquired to date: “Legend is just a name, I know better than to be so proud\\/I won’t drink in all this fame\\/Or take more love than I’m allowed.” At this stage of his career—which includes 10 Grammy awards, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award for Best Original Song—Legend could’ve continued to play it safe; his mix of secular and spiritual soul has taken him far over the years. But on Darkness and Light, Legend pushes beyond his comfort zone for something a bit more ambitious. With its meditative and ingratiating songwriting, this is unmistakably a John Legend album, yet there’s a renewed sense of peace and even a sad wisdom that distinguishes it. He sings lovingly of his infant daughter, Luna, wondering who she will become as she grows older. He ponders the different sides of love, and the raw emotions they evoke. He's made a love record about navigating the bleak world and finding happiness in dark times.For Darkness and Light, Legend reached out to Blake Mills after hearing what the producer did for Alabama Shakes’ breakout LP, Sound & Color. In turn, Mills wanted to push Legend to the limits of his emotional range. “There was this hole in John’s material that I felt like a huge part of his personality could come through,” Mills recently told Billboard. “We’re still talking about ‘What’s Going On’ some 40 years later. Yes, ‘Sexual Healing’ is a great track. But when we think of Marvin Gaye, ‘What’s Going On’ is the song that comes up.” The implicit criticism there rings true: Legend has calling-card songs like “Ordinary People” and “All of Me,” yet by and large, he makes safe R&B that doesn’t resonate long-term or hit hard politically (he released a collaborative LP with the Roots in 2010, but those were covers of Curtis Mayfield, Nina Simone, and Bill Withers.)For Darkness and Light, Mills wanted to merge Legend’s artistic and political sides, bringing the opinionated guy we see on “Real Time With Bill Maher” to the forefront. We hear shades of this on “Penthouse Floor,” a standout featuring Chance the Rapper, even if the grooving track behind Legend still feels more sultry than angry as he wonders: “All this trouble in this here town\\/All this shit going down\\/When will they focus on this?\\/Streets fired up with the TV crews\\/Look, Ma, we on the news!\\/But they didn’t notice before this.” Conversely, on the Miguel-featured “Overload,” Legend reflects on his marriage to model Chrissy Teigen, running down the endless distractions posed by the shiny device in his hand as a metaphor for connection (“Let that cell phone ring\\/Let that blue bird sing\\/Let that message say ‘unread.’”) The album comes full circle near the end, on “How Can I Blame You,” in which Legend is pulled over for a traffic violation—but instead of a menacing encounter, or a meditation on the rash of police shootings of black men during traffic stops, Legend uses the moment as a metaphor for life’s rapid pace. He’s urged to slow down and appreciate what he has. In the end, Darkness and Light isn’t the political feat Mills and Legend had hoped for, but it’s a step forward in the singer’s evolution. He may never be a firebrand, but Legend proves there’s still strength in humility.\"],[22393,\"Courting confusion is part of the job description for anyone working in the avant-garde. Some experimenters meet this requirement with the equivalent of a shrug, while others take to the task with more evident relish. For over half a century, the singer and visual artist Yoko Ono has found herself in the latter camp, gleefully scrawling her new approaches into the official ledgers of cultural production.  The editors of the recent volume Fluxbooks credit Ono’s 1964 Grapefruit as being “one of the first works of art in book form.” Ono’s early short films likewise helped expand cinematic practices. In the years before she started dating a Beatle, Ono sang with one of John Cage’s most trusted musical interpreters, and turned a New York loft space into a contemporary-art destination that drew the likes of Marcel Duchamp to her door.Yet this multimedia artist’s most notorious act of provocation was her approach to becoming tabloid fodder. She took one of the world’s most popular musicians and hurried along his engagement with the experimental fringe (an attraction already evident in John Lennon’s work, as early as 1966’s Revolver). In some quarters, she’s never been forgiven for this. But Ono’s radical influence on pop history has also inspired generations of visionary artists.The Lennon\\/Ono collaborative albums were a critical part of their take on celebrity coupledom. Their first two LPs carried the series title “Unfinished Music,” a conceptual gambit with deeper roots in the aesthetic of the Fluxus art movement than in that of the British Invasion. The first set to be issued, subtitled Two Virgins, was a sound-collage set reportedly produced during their first night together. The album’s name, and the full-frontal nudity of its cover, referenced the couple’s sense of innocence in approaching a new beginning—as well as the fact that the recording took place just prior to the consummation of their relationship.As the product of a first date, Two Virgins is fascinating. As a sound artifact from the initial decade of Fluxus-inspired activity, it has plenty of competition. Casual clips of the couple’s conversations—mixed in alongside Lennon’s tape loops—blur the distinction between the private and the public-facing. This approach recalls efforts by some of Ono’s contemporaries, like Charlotte Moorman and Benjamin Patterson. But what makes Two Virgins distinct is the range of Ono’s voice. In the opening moments, she contributes some pure-tone humming, which sounds downright companionable amid Lennon’s meandering keyboard motifs and reverb tape-effects. Four-and-a-half-minutes in, Ono unleashes the first of her extended yelps, from the top of her range. Even if you know it’s coming, this sound always registers as shocking.This aspect of Ono’s musicianship confused (and enraged) large portions of Lennon’s audience. Despite her purposeful variations of timbre and her ability to hit notes cleanly, Ono’s recourse to this proto-punk wail was often decried as unmusical. And after the White Album’s “Revolution 9”—a much tighter collage created by Lennon, Ono and George Harrison, now sometimes interpreted by classical musicians—she was often accused of being the driving agent behind the Beatles’ breakup. Tensions from Beatlemania carry over into the couple’s second, less idyllic “Unfinished Music” release, subtitled Life With the Lions. Corporate tussles between the Beatles and their record label provide some of the inspiration for “No Bed for Beatle John,” a piece recorded in Ono’s hospital room, following a miscarriage. The album’s dominant track, though, is the side-length workout “Cambridge 1969,” a live recording driven by Lennon’s guitar feedback and Ono’s harshest vocalizations.In failing to create much interest over its 26 minutes, “Cambridge 1969” reveals something important about Ono’s art. The performances of hers that work don’t do so merely because she can kick up a unique noise. Instead, the takes that have true liftoff usually find her switching up those extreme textures with greater frequency. Unlike some of the composers she hung out with, circa 1961, Ono is not a drone artist. She’s an expert in subtle variations, carved from blocks of seeming chaos.Her 1970 album Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band is a triumph, in part, because it sounds fully aware of this reality. It’s also iconic because it contains some of Lennon’s most aggressive guitar work. Opener “Why” hurtles from its needle-drop opening, with slide guitar swoops and febrile picking that anticipate the variety of Ono’s vocal lines. When the singer enters, she wastes no time in applying a range of approaches to her one-word lyric sheet. Long expressions full of vibrato give way to shorter exhalations, rooted in the back of the throat. Spates of shredded laughter communicate the absurdist good humor that’s often present in Ono’s work. The minimalist pounding of drummer Ringo Starr and bassist Klaus Voormann is there as a foil, propped against all the invention on offer from Ono and Lennon.“Why Not” inverts this script by arranging similar licks inside a slower tempo. Ono’s voice becomes more pinched and childlike, while Lennon’s guitar lines have a bluesier profile. Elsewhere, Ono puts a new spin on an “instruction” piece from her Grapefruit book, with the echo-laden “Greenfield Morning I Pushed an Empty Baby Carriage All Over the City.” Here, in another surprise, Ono’s voice sounds stolid and more traditionally “correct.” That feel is subsequently obliterated by the noisy middle section of “AOS,” a track Ono recorded in ’68 with saxophonist Ornette Coleman’s band. The Lennon-led backing group returns for the final two pieces of the original LP configuration, which have a comparatively calmer air. Like Lennon’s ’70 solo album of the same name (and near-identical cover), Ono’s Plastic Ono Band initially scans as acerbic, yet manages to create a supple variety of song-forms from that opening template. Ono’s absorption of her new husband’s sonic language was only beginning to pay dividends, too. As Sean Lennon’s Chimera imprint and the Secretly Canadian label continue to reissue her catalog, Ono’s subsequent experiments with rock and pop formats will come into clearer view for audiences that have only heard rumors about her craft. Still, these opening reissues—which come complete with era-appropriate B-sides and outtakes—all manage to reflect a key aspect of Ono’s broader artistic intentions, as defined in a 1971 artist’s statement: “I like to fight the establishment by using methods that are so far removed from establishment-type thinking that the establishment doesn’t know how to fight back.”\"],[22660,\"“Deejays predate the internet, in a way,” Coldcut’s Jonathan More told the Chicago Tribune in 1997. “We’re filters who select information from different sources and give it a context for people to grab on to.” That probably made a certain amount of sense then, right on the cusp of the dot-com boom, but compared to everything that happened next—MP3 downloads, P2P networks, YouTube, Spotify—the idea of a DJ as a crucial node in a global information network sounds as antiquated as a tin-can-and-string toy telephone. And so, in its own quaint way, does Coldcut’s debut single, “Say Kids What Time Is It?,” which will celebrate its 30th anniversary in February. A cut-and-paste hip-hop jam inspired by Steinski’s turntable collages, the tune sampled a mess of funk and disco breaks along with snippets of The Jungle Book and the theme to the 1950s television show “Howdy Doody”—a show that, when Coldcut recorded the song, was roughly as distant in time as their debut single is from us today.Coldcut have always had a McCluhan-esque fascination with the collision of form and content. That was the driving impulse behind those early experiments in turntablism and sampling, which mimicked the distracted zapping encouraged by cable television and remote controls. But as the flow of information has sped up, Coldcut have struggled to articulate a compelling framework for their own productions, even as their label, Ninja Tune, has asserted itself as a leading force in beat-oriented electronic music. Their last album, 2006’s Sound Mirrors, brought together dancehall beats and acid house with spoken word from Saul Williams, snippets of the poet Amiri Baraka’s voice, and tag-team sloganeering from Jon Spencer and Mike Ladd—an eclectic assemblage that couldn’t quite decide where it wanted to go or what it wanted to be.This new EP, their first release in a decade, looks at first like an attempt to engage with our own critical media moment, in which “message” is smothered by a deluge of disinformation. The record cover strikingly juggles elements of mid-20th-century Polish poster design, the staticky “snow” of a dead television screen, and the scrambled logo of the Daily Mail, a right-wing populist tabloid in the UK; press materials present the record as “an exercise in ‘dissentertainment’.” But nothing in the EP’s five tracks measures up to that rhetoric. Mostly, it serves as a vehicle for the London rapper Roots Manuva and the singer Roses Gabor, although their contributions sound like they were meant for two entirely different records. On lead track “Only Heaven,” Roots Manuva rattles off stream-of-consciousness assonant rhymes (“Molotov quality\\/Causing controversy\\/Oh, it’s so odd to see\\/Oh, it’s so novelty”) that sound great—he’s such a personable vocalist, he could make the phone book sound catchy—but don’t add up to much. On the chorus, a sighing Roses Gabor offers platitudes: “Only heaven can ever save me\\/Feels like hell out on these streets\\/I need you more than you need me.” Like worn Velcro, the two halves fail to stick together, and the backing track, a twinkling approximation of early Portishead, doesn’t make up for what’s missing lyrically; the same goes for the closing “Quality Control,” a woozy dub version of the title cut.The languid “Dreamboats” is more interesting musically, particularly in a narcotic breakdown that loops Gabor’s voice against clanking chains and ethereal coos. But again, Roots Manuva’s third-eye mindstates and Gabor’s vaguely erotic hook  fail to complement each other in any meaningful way. “Creative,” meanwhile, might as well be Coldcut’s homage to Disclosure’s brand of garage-influenced house—which is ironic, given the song’s anti-biter vocal hook, which they’ve sampled from a 1989 single by the South London rapper Black Radical MKII. More charitably, you could compare its swirls of layered synths to Four Tet, but that’s not enough to make it sound particularly vital.Musically, the most interesting thing here is “Donald’s Wig,” a rolling drum’n’bass tune featuring Gabor solo. Unfortunately, it flies the furthest from the mark they’ve set for themselves with the “dissentertainment” tag. Perhaps the topic seemed like a good idea at the time, when they went into the studio; from afar—across the Atlantic, and, crucially, months before the U.S. presidential election of November 2016—a tongue-in-cheek song about Donald Trump must have appeared a fairly low-stakes affair. It is precisely the kind of absurdist, media-savvy, vaguely political thing that Coldcut have always delighted in. But the song fails to engage with its subject matter in any meaningful way beyond the title, even though the press release explicitly references the then-candidate, now president-elect. The hook—“Don’t give up your race\\/Days are going to wait”—was presumably meant in the context of the electoral race, but as the specter of white nationalism looms ever larger over Trump’s cabinet and rabid fan base, the line comes to seem unfortunately vague at best. Post-election and, for the UK, post-Brexit, we’re well aware of all the ways the media has failed us. Rather than providing a superficial media critique, Coldcut would be better off taking a page from their own book and returning to the righteous anger that fueled their 2002 remix with Saul Williams, “Not in My Name.”\"],[22553,\"In their respective careers, singer-songwriter Joan Wasser (AKA Joan as Police Woman) and multi-instrumentalist Benjamin Lazar Davis have both flirted with pop accessibility while also keeping their distance. Of the two, Wasser has hewed closer to traditional pop forms, while Davis has taken a more academic approach with the chamber pop outfit Cuddle Magic. But on their first collaboration Let It Be You, Wasser and Davis indulge themselves, revealing a shared sweet tooth for bubblegum bombast that will likely shock each of their fanbases. Aside from her work with Anohni, Rufus Wainwright, and Lou Reed, Wasser’s solo output repeatedly demonstrates her natural affinity for songcraft. In particular, she’s shown a knack for borrowing from mainstream pop music in a way that preserves its dignity. Her heavily soul-inflected work, arty as it may be, reminds us of a time when pop tunes wound up in jazz clubs without losing anything in translation. Unlike so many of her peers, Wasser never comes off like she's slumming, instead working deftly at the porous border between whatever separates “highbrow” and “popular” art.Meanwhile, Davis—who has a much more playful, high-energy presence—brings an explosive spark to the material. Where Wasser's bittersweet chords on piano and guitar reflect the full, often messy range of everyday feelings, Davis tends to lean towards more childlike expressions. One would expect these differences to create fertile ground on an album that addresses relationships so much. But the pair undercuts the human element of the music by play-acting at singing big and bold for the people way up in the cheap seats. On the aptly named “Overloaded,” the chorus scrapes the adult-contempo stratosphere by mimicking the familiar production style of huge-budget R&B-inflected pop music. Here and elsewhere, Davis and Wasser play off of one another, egging each other on to dial up the schmaltz and clearly having fun in the process. They sound positively giddy, but the results almost completely sideline the moodiness that drives the spirit of both Cuddle Magic and Joan As Policewoman.Case in point: the Let It Be You version of “Overloaded” oozes with outsized melodrama—you’d believe it if someone told you it had been written with Katy Perry in mind. Cuddle Magic’s rendition, on the other hand, hits more subtle notes by enticing you to read between the lines. On Let It Be You, the song becomes somewhat faceless, one of several love songs that wear heartbreak like a neon-colored stage costume. And generic turns of phrase like “It hurts so bad how much I love you\\/Makes me wanna die when I'm thinkin’ of you” (from “Hurts So Bad”) make it hard to tell whether Wasser and Davis are mocking or celebrating the pop vocabulary they’re employing.Sonically speaking, Let It Be You is undeniably rich, and there are moments where Wasser and Davis weave around each other like seasoned dance partners. The title track, for example, starts with a bit-crushed melody line and handclap samples that reference the Central African Republic Pygmy rhythms that initially brought the pair together. At first, Wasser faux-rhymes in a flat-pitched, finger-wagging tone like she's doing her best Luscious Jackson impersonation. But when she and Davis harmonize together on the chorus, the song soars to a more sublime place—where most of this album should aim.Let It Be You shows what it could have been on the final track, the ultra-solemn “Station,” which starts with Wasser singing accompanied only by watery electric guitar for several verses. The funereal vibe is so jarring—and convincingly heartrending—that at first it sounds as if a Joan As Policewoman tune ended up on the wrong record. Perhaps “Station” would have been better served set aside for one of Wasser’s own albums. Here, it feels like a glimpse of foregone possibility on a lower-stakes project, the sound of two pros blowing off steam by proving they can recreate Top 40 spectacle. It might be a good time, but good times aren’t what got Joan Wasser and Benjamin Lazar Davis where they are. \"],[22626,\"At the turn of the century, emo had finally gone pop, but hadn’t felt like music for popular kids. On Clear Channel playlists, “The Middle” and “Screaming Infidelities” were boyish, bashful contrast to the goateed bullies of nu-grunge and rap-metal and the New Rock Revival’s trouser-stuffing sexuality. But while Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional were extensions of the church basement and DIY house scenes that fostered Christie Front Drive, the Get Up Kids, and the Promise Ring, they would soon be overtaken by the likes of Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, and plenty of bands who were basically jocks in ringer T’s: they were loud, rude, and thought about little other than sex. The Long Island band’s 2001 debut Your Favorite Weapon helped establish the sound and the gender politics for a time when emo would draw in more fans of both sexes than ever before, but often cleared the room of people who expected punk rock to be a welcoming or progressive environment. To this day, “Emo Night” most likely means drunken 20-somethings yelling along with “Jude Law and a Semester Abroad.”After the potent but obnoxious venting of Your Favorite Weapon, Brand New’s ambitions started to emerge two years later on Deja Entendu—they hired a guy who engineered Pixies records to produce it, wrote the acoustic weeper “The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot” to prove they’d heard the Smiths, and added a guitar solo on “Good to Know That if I Ever Need Attention All I Have to Do is Die” that veered so close to “Hotel California” it proved they’d probably never heard the Eagles. But frontman Jesse Lacey still inhabited a stunted, vindictive emotional viewpoint—even as he spent considerable time staring at an empty bottle, ruefully recounting the failure of copious sex and substances to provide him with any lasting happiness, he was just as quick to boast about a lifestyle that let him basically fuck and drink however much he wanted: “I wouldn’t stop if I could\\/Oh it hurts to be this good,” he admitted on “Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don’t.” His flexing and his self-loathing were both forms of the same narcissism: In this way, he was almost proto-Drake.Brand New jumped from Triple Crown to Interscope after Deja Entendu, and no one would’ve been surprised if major-label money and expectations would’ve caused Lacey to go even deeper into his vices. But based on the ensuing Fight Off Your Demons demos, Lacey was at least willing to make an effort to be the better man. “Brother’s Song” and “1996” were worldly and warm, allowing someone else’s story to be told for once. But this embryonic version of Brand New’s third album was leaked by overzealous fans (and sold back to them a decade later), causing a disillusioned and emotionally violated Lacey to retreat inward again. By the time The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me was completed, he may have realized that the world didn’t revolve around him—but he was now the dark center of the universe, a howling spiritual void.  Theology had always played an under-appreciated role in emo’s development. In fact, the golden era of emo was often praise music: witness the effect of Jeremy Enigk’s born-again Christianity on How It Feels to Be Something On, the exaltation of Mineral’s “Gloria,” or the existence of overtly denominational labels like Tooth & Nail. Even skeptics like David Bazan and Aaron Weiss could still quote scripture through their struggles. Besides, the mid-2000’s was a time when rock music of many stripes reasserted its faith: 2004 alone gave us Pedro the Lion’s Achilles Heel and mewithoutYou’s Catch for Us the Foxes, as well as the proudly Mormon Brandon Flowers, “Jesus Walks,” and Seven Swans. But while emo had previously been defined by passionate vocalists, desperately pleading to the heavens for salvation, Lacey was telling Jesus Christ not to bother— “I’m scared I’ll get scared and I swear I’ll try to nail you back up.”It’s teen angst blown up to literally biblical proportions, resonating like no emo band before or since to outcasts in Sunday school and high school. But as sure as Brand New is an emo band, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me is not an emo record. It might actually be post-emo: “Was losing all my friends, was losing them to drinking and to driving,” Lacey mutters with unsettling resignation on the album’s first lyric. He sounds no more relieved to say in the next line, “Was losing all my friends, but I got ‘em back.” Whereas Lacey once took great pride in his ability to turn even the smallest slights into voluble LiveJournal status updates (“my tongue’s the only muscle in my body that works harder than my heart”), The Devil and God is often a dispassionate eulogy for that version of himself and his silly little feelings: “I used to be such a burning example,” “I used to care I was being careful,” “goodbye to love.”  To some degree, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me can be classified as soulless—albeit “soulless” as an aesthetically powerful narrative choice. Positive reviews of The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me likened Brand New to Radiohead and Modest Mouse—“Limousine (MS Rebridge)” is loosely modeled after “Exit Music (For a Film),” but Radiohead comparisons often serve as generic shorthand for “ambitious, brooding alternative rock.” The latter reference presumably referred to the band’s newfound affinity for whammy-bar harmonics and The Moon & Antarctica’s permafrost ambience, particularly on “Jesus.” In fact, the band had originally started working with Dennis Herring, who produced Modest Mouse’s Good News For People Who Love Bad News, an unexpected commercial success that put them in a position to share a co-headlining bill with Brand New this past year. But Lacey is soulless in a way that recalls Thom Yorke on Kid A and Isaac Brock on The Moon & Antarctica—these are narrators who have lost something substantial, who have been separated from their physical being and seem to be staring down at a Sim-version of themselves. “I’m not here, this isn’t happening,” Yorke moaned, while Brock asked, “Does anybody know a way for a body to get away?” A seriously unnerving performance of “Jesus” on “Late Night with David Letterman” presents Lacey as a spiritual husk, and there are Easter egg references to the cover art of Deja Entendu as an avatar for his former self: “this bedwetting cosmonaut,” “space cadet, pull out.” The Devil and God even sounds soulless. Despite being on Interscope’s dime, the band ran out of time and money while working with Herring and switched to “fifth member” Mike Sapone, responsible for the functional, nondescript mainstreamo sound of Your Favorite Weapon. And yet the same cold, clinical production is responsible for The Devil and God’s unusual and appropriate atmosphere. At no point does Lacey sound suicidal —in fact, he sounds resigned to living (“Do you feel condemned just being there?”). While The Devil and God touches on Nirvana, Joy Division, and Elliott Smith, it doesn’t attempt to conjure those artists’ specific psychosomatic distresses, whether through dyspeptic churn, epileptic terror, or catatonic depression. Lacey begs for divine retribution, and some of the most bludgeoning dynamics you’ll hear on a modern rock record deliver it. The added percussion on “Millstone” conveys metal-on-bone trauma, while instrumental “Welcome to Bangkok” could pass for an interstitial from The Seer. But The Devil and God is defined by its crippling “drops”—the chorus on “Sowing Season (Yeah)” plays on textbook Pixies-style explosiveness, but the full-band crashes on “Limousine,” “You Won’t Know,” and especially “Luca” are completely unexpected, the kind that cause convulsions at your desk or a swerve off the road. There isn’t a single warm or welcoming texture, just expanses of dulled existence and the brutal punishment Lacey so vehemently feels he deserves. But what exactly has he done? On Deja Entendu’s shockingly callous “Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis” (Brand New’s own “Marvins Room”), Lacey coldly copped to his “desperate desires and unadmirable plans” but gave himself an out by presenting it all as a hypothetical (“if you let me have my way, I swear I’d tear you apart”). He wasn't the only guy in this realm passing off non-apologetic psychosexual reckoning as introspection at the time. This mode of songwriting often made for compelling gossip, but limited Brand New’s scope to things that actually happened to Jesse Lacey. Freed from the constraints of autobiography, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me allows Brand New to inhabit far more frightening mindsets, both real and fictional; similar to Sufjan Stevens’ “John Wayne Gacy Jr.,” a murderer’s heinous actions become a philosophical exercise, daring the listener to really consider whether they can empathize and see their own worst impulses made real. “Luca” takes its name from Vito Corleone’s most barbaric consigliere, one who impregnated an Irish prostitute, murdered her, and then strongarmed the midwife into burning a child in a furnace. On “Limousine (MS Rebridge)” and “You Won’t Know,” Lacey invokes the appalling death of 7-year old Katie Flynn, killed by a man driving the wrong way down Meadowbrook Parkway in Long Island with a .28 BAC, hours after being a flower girl at her aunt’s wedding. As alluded to in “Sowing Season,” too many of Lacey’s friends, and perhaps himself included, could have been Martin Heidgen, the man behind the wheel, and The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me hinges on the conclusion that the willingness to sin is equal to actual sin if you’re subject to judgment from an omnipotent being. Lacey’s verse from the perspective of Heidgen ends as a half-assed plea for mercy from an unsalvageable human being who knows exactly what he is: “I saw our sad messiah\\/He was bored and tired of my laments\\/Said, ‘I’d die for you one time but never again’,” Lacey sings, drawing the parallel between Heidgen’s earthly verdict and the one Lacey expects when he meets his maker. The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me rarely admits to much, diametrically opposed to melodramatic oversharing and tabloid exploits of Fall Out Boy, Panic! At the Disco, and My Chemical Romance that defined emo in the MySpace era. This was all very risky in 2006, especially for a band making its major label debut. Though critically acclaimed, the less enthusiastic reviews balked at the portentous epics and wished for more of the scorched-sugar rush of Deja Entendu. It’s not unwarranted; underwritten lyrics occasionally cut against the sober sonics (“Life is a test and I get bad marks”), and there’s just enough radio-friendly spite to remind the listener of the sound Brand New had grown out of. “Not the Sun” strains to extrapolate sexual denial into hellish spiritual immolation, while the broadly political and triumphant “The Archers Bows Have Broken” is an awkward fit within the otherwise insular and defeatist The Devil and God, especially as it leads into the nihilistic despondence of closer “Handcuffs.” Neither of those immediately accessible tracks were released as singles. Preliminary interviews were scarce and often with obscure, non-American publications (“in the States, you get misrepresented...the headline would end up being something stupid like ‘We hate My Chemical Romance,’” Lacey complained). Given a late-November release date unusual for non-marquee acts, The Devil and God peaked at #31 on Billboard, neither a flop nor a resounding success. Ten years ago today, Brand New were supporting The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me on the road with Dashboard Confessional. Starting next week, they’ll be playing 15,000-cap arenas in the UK. The explanation isn’t simply, “they made The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me.” Its effect on Brand New itself feels difficult to quantify and certainly not immediate: while 2009’s Daisy debuted in the top ten, it fell out after six weeks with little impact, its reception amongst critics and Brand New fans decidedly mixed. Though it’s not Brand New’s worst album, it’s certainly the one the least number of Brand New fans would say is their best. But their status as one of the most popular cult bands is more attributable to what they didn’t do after Daisy. Some of the presumed trolling behind Brand New’s current mythology might just be due to administrative errors or a desire to tie up loose ends before their maybe, maybe-not 2018 breakup: the liner notes for The Devil and God contained no lyrics, but an invitation to send one dollar for a booklet. Nine years later, fans were finally receiving them. And while their peers became overexposed or uninspired, Brand New’s continued insistence to let their fans speak for them created one of the loudest echo chambers going—“The Complete Guide to Brand New’s Comeback Album,” “Tunnelling Down the Brand New Wormhole,” “Brand New Came Up With a New Way to Mess With You Today,” “Brand New Just F*cking With Us at This Point,” this is all substantial Brand New LP5 reportage. By leaving his words and intentions open to interpretation, Lacey unwittingly shifted from a minor celebrity to a generational voice. For the most part, Brand New played the role of a principled, popular rock act that felt very uncomfortable with their position as spokespeople. There hasn’t been one like this in a very, very long time. The marginalization of rock music in the 21st century actually benefits a band like Brand New, as it pushes together potentially incompatible subsets of listeners. These days, Brand New have enough clout to play shows with their heroes in Built to Spill and Modest Mouse, but in 2006, most of their attempts to place themselves within a counterculture lineage somehow went unnoticed: the cover art for the “Jesus” single is a blatant homage to Jesus Lizard’s Goat, the title of The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me is an obscure reference to Daniel Johnston. And when Brand New really tried to make their own answer to In Utero with Daisy, Lacey was namedropping Fugazi, Polvo and Archers of Loaf as formative influences.But Vinnie Accardi, the guitarist who co-wrote most of Daisy, mentioned Stone Temple Pilots’ Core and Alice in Chains’ Jar of Flies as his touchstones. And Brand New’s ability to hit the cheap seats—the first two choruses on Devil and God are “yeah” and “whoa”—make their discomfort and recalcitrance with their heralded status compelling rather than a matter of fact. At a point where most rock acts are going out of their way to ingratiate themselves with their audience and reach across aisles, Lacey screams  “I am not your friend, I’m not your lover, I’m not your family,” and it’s weirdly comforting to affirm him, with a blood-curdling YEAH. Brand New died for emo one time, but never again.\"],[22639,\"How do you pin down Sun Ra? The cosmic jazzman laid down so much music it would take a warehouse of full-time historians working round-the-clock hours to figure it all out. Albums were often hastily assembled from his prolific sessions, packaged with DIY artwork and sold at gigs for quick cash. Thousands of hours of unheard recordings are rumored to exist. Maybe he stacked boxes of magnetic tape on far-away planets too, such was his connection to the stars.If it’s even possible to traverse the vast Sun Ra universe on board a single starship, then Strut Records’ new compilation Singles: The Definitive 45s Collection offers a compellingly sturdy vessel.  It’s a 65-track set of 7-inch fragments of the celestial god, sent to earth to help us map out details of his galaxy that the albums could not. There are no wasted motions here: Each flat, wax disc represented another bright star in the constellation Ra. The name of his birth certificate read Herman Poole Blount. Born in Alabama in 1914, the mysterious musician showed up in Chicago in 1946 with little more to his name than a jail record picked up for refusing to fight in World War II for ethical reasons. The jazz scene was primed for revolution and Blount moved to a different beat, driven by a journey to Saturn he claimed he made years earlier while in deep spiritual concentration.The star man would later take up the name Sun Ra, form his ever-changing band the Arkestra, and spend a lifetime teaching the world Afrofuturism, a complex ideology of Black nationalism, Egyptian myth, scientific discovery, science fiction movies and the other-worldly fashion choices he’d flaunt on-stage. Forget “Disco 2000”; Sun Ra was envisioning to the paranoid blips and beeps of “Disco 2021” some 30 years before Pulp showed up. He mastered the electro squiggles of “Planet Rock” prior to the birth of hip-hop, and forged his own form of analogue cyberpunk as Philip K. Dick sat as his typewriter laying out his own dark vision of the future. Singles preserves all that for future generations.It’s said when you watch classic movies like Citizen Kane today, it’s important to bare in mind that these movies were writing the rules of filmmaking that we now take for granted. Sun Ra’s music somehow doesn’t require that kind of explanation. As soon as the needle drops, it sounds like scripture—a key testament that formed a building block of a half-century of music. Everyone from George Clinton to OutKast read from The Book of Ra. And yet, on paper the project seems an odd prospect. Sun Ra was a lot of things—pianist, bluesman, bandleader, arranger, interstellar poet, multiverse traveller—but he’s never been accused of being a singles artist. Because of the format, Singles eschews his lengthier wigouts for shorter vignettes. You might not get the 20-minute avant-garde virtuosity of “Space Is the Place,” but you do get jaunty holiday jingle “It’s Christmas Time.” That might seem less crucial, but when grappling with Ra’s slippery legacy, nothing here feels disposable.For the fanatics, Singles will offer little they’ve not heard before. While the original 45 versions of a lot of these songs, many of which were released on Ra’s own El Saturn Records, are rare (or, in some cases, completely lost), they’ve all cropped up in other places, including a similar-but-less-expansive compilation put out by Evidence Records in 1996. Still, there’s undoubted power in hearing Ra’s career laid out like this.Arranged chronologically (or as close to it as possible—Ra wasn’t exactly pedantic when it came to labeling his sessions) and with about half the songs recorded during his 1950s Chicago period, Singles captures the genesis of his forward-thinking space-bop. Fittingly, the opening two tracks, “I Am an Instrument” and “I Am Strange,” both spoken-word numbers, predict his metaphysical interests. “I belong to one who is more than a musician\\/He is an artist,” he says on the former. His voice is tuned low and grave, as though foreshadowing a seismic event.Whether he’s envisioning a playful, pamphlet-utopian version of the city on the Lieber-Stoller-esque “Chicago USA” or mixing experimental rhythms with dense and fractured chants on “Spaceship Lullaby” (both recorded with the Nu Sounds, an important precursor to the Arkestra), it’s thrilling to hear Ra connect Chicago’s timeless jazz scene to his increasingly wild tinkerings. Even the earliest material on Singles is the sound of a bandleader confidently wielding his arsenal for maximum purpose.It’s not just Ra that gets shine. Singles captures The Arkestra at their finest. John Gilmore, a chief lieutenant in the group for almost 40 years, blusters with his tenor saxophone on the peppy “Soft Talk,” recorded in his first few years alongside Ra. The gentle horn riff of “Space Loneliness”—from 1960, Ra’s final year in Chicago—pulls you towards the void of the outer cosmos before blissful and delicate solos from Phil Cohran (cornet) and Marshall Allen (alto sax) chime in. Given the nature of the format, Singles also showcases Ra’s pop instincts. Whether it’s the smooth doo-wop of “Daddy’s Gonna Tell You Know Lie” (of which there are two versions), the wild-man energy of singer Yochanan on blistering R&B number “Hot Skillet Momma,” or Hattie Randolph’s sweet rendition of jazz standard “Round Midnight,” it’s a thrill to hear Ra carve out lean jukebox jams. On “Bye Bye,” the sweet harmonies of the Cosmic Rays are drowned out by short, sharp skewering of double bass that tears through the final few seconds. Recorded a decade before George Martin was doing that sort of thing, it confirms that even in the pop realm, Ra was a daring futurist.The later work sees Ra fully exploring the outer realms of his own talent. “Disco 2021” sounds like an android’s fever dream. A doomed but dinky organ holds hands with a Gilmore-led wind quartet on the ugly-beautiful “Outer Space Plateau.” Ra incorporates a Moog synth into “The Perfect Man”; probably recorded in mid-1973, he deploys a bluesy horn riff as the bedrock before running wild with the synthetic instrument. It’s a strange mismatch, but “The Perfect Man” feels like a rare link between dapper nightclub blues and the space-bound sounds of new wave, disco and early hip-hop. The song encapsulates Sun Ra’s freewheeling, alien brilliance. The London-based Strut Records has long been prolific in unearthing and reissuing old music and has gotten pretty damn good at it. The three-disc CD and LP releases of Singles: The Definitive 45s Collection includes a lot of the trimmings you might expect: rare photos, artwork, sleeve notes and an interview with El Saturn Records founder Alton Abraham. There’s also detailed track-by-track and session notes by project compiler Paul Griffiths that you’ll open up a lot as you grapple with this set. Strut is experienced in dusting off old recordings, so the remasters sound crisp—particularly when played back-to-back with versions that cropped up on other compilations—but without suffocating that rich 45rpm flavor. In addition to the CD and digital releases, Strut is putting out 20 cuts from the collection in two 45s box sets (Volume 1 released this month, Volume 2 released in March 2017) in a limited 500 copies run for the dedicated looking to fully immerse in the spirit of their original releases. For newcomers here for spiritual guidance, broaching Sun Ra’s seismic life work can be daunting. To penetrate the outer atmosphere and splash down into an unknown world; to crawl into a mind of a man with the power to transport his consciousness across our solar system. Singles offers a wide-ranging but accessible route to his unearthly sounds.\"],[22658,\"Though firmly rooted in ’70s progressive and psychedelic rock, Dungen has never felt like a tribute act, throwback or genre exercise. By offering up honest-to-god great songs with memorable vocals leads, fluid performances, killer arrangements and an unflinching love of the flute, they nail the vibe of their beloved era while always sounding like themselves. On Häxan, the group presents a recent scoring of the 1926 animation classic The Adventures of Prince Achmed, replacing the original’s crackling symphonic score with fourteen interludes, rave-ups and mini-suites that nod knowingly to the past while remaining fresh. Like most soundtracks, Häxan comes alive in context. Though marketed as a stand-alone album, it reads more as a deep psych mood board than a truly independent work. There’s an abundance of production details to get lost in, and the band sounds as vital as ever—dynamic, tight and assured. The fuzzy guitar and scraped piano strings on the title track give the feel of a genuine Morricone relic, and the gorgeous organ on “Kalifen” nods overtly to “A Whiter Shade of Pale” without feeling cheap. Recorded to and edited on tape, there’s an exquisite warmth to the entire album, with plenty of chunky, vibrant textures. Tiny details, like the trail of a spring reverb or a strikingly loud shaker panned way off in the stereo field give a sense of raw physicality, of players reacting to one another in a room.One of the best moments comes early on, in “Wak-Wak’s Portar.” Sounding like a live bootleg from 1976, the group blurs into a monolithic, phased out wall of sound… except for the flute. Loud and in charge, it cuts across the whole mix, demanding to be heard. It’s an awesome, and funny, minute and a half, which suddenly gives way to some distant elevator music. Dungen are clearly enjoying themselves.Once the album is finished, however, the songs stay with you less than these details. To start, at 40 minutes it’s barely more than half the length of Adventures, which means you can’t toss it on alongside the film and have a seamless experience start-to-finish.  Nonetheless, letting the two play simultaneously does have its rewards. Album opener “Peri Banu Vid Sjön” initially sounded like a bland bit of coffee shop fodder. But next to the opening credits, it bloomed, teasing out a melancholy ache behind the tale of adventure about to unfold.At times, there were moments of startling synchronicity. More importantly, the moods simply matched up often. Dungen’s rollicking, questing rhythm section and flight-of-fancy solos sync up well with the flying horses, shapeshifting spell casters and voyages to faraway lands, and the more eerie, spaced out passages worked great in tenser scenes. Still, an edit that we could match to the film would have been a more-than-welcome addition. As it is, Häxan occupies an odd slot in Dungen’s hard hitting and respectably consistent discography: a labor of love that is less than essential, rewarding but not attention grabbing, remarkably ambitious and yet strangely ephemeral. \"],[22638,\"Though her soundtrack for Jonathan Glazer’s 2014 feature Under the Skin was more prominently received, Mica Levi’s tape Feeling Romantic Feeling Tropical Feeling Ill felt like her landmark release that year. The hour-long mix, with colorful, droning chapters bleeding seamlessly into one another, broke from the brash pop of her band Micachu & the Shapes, offering instead an elastic take on avant-garde composition. Loose and weird, it stomped and crackled all over the place, brimming with an impulsive sense of personality.On this new collaboration with cellist and producer Oliver Coates, who also performed on the Under the Skin OST, Levi loops back to that unstructured sound. (Accordingly, Remain Calm has origins in a live collaboration for NTS Radio, also in 2014.) But she builds it up, too, by decluttering and introducing a more orchestral sensibility. With her songwriting for Micachu & the Shapes or her soundtracks, one gets the sense that Levi is sinking herself into a style, a set of constraints, conditions reflected in those projects’ concision. Here, as with Feeling Romantic, the field is wide open, and the results are imaginative and multi-textured.In form, these 13 tracks, most under three minutes long, resemble sketches. This is not at all to the release’s detriment—rather, it recalls the stylistic play and emotional frankness of Arthur Russell’s World of Echo—and this unfinished quality is a crucial method of delivery. The minimal “Schoolhouse,” which lasts 43 seconds, sees Coates’ bright picked strings weighted by a teasing beat. “I’ll Keep Going” is more lush, even mournful, the titular refrain repeated in a smeary drone over piano and deep, sustained cello notes. Coates’ instrumentation is lovely but understated, folding effortlessly into the clattering productions such that prim classical connotations feel like afterthoughts. Even when the cello is brought to the fore—on “County H,” for example, which consists of just strings and a barely-tonal radio-transmitter-like sound—it’s repetitive, textural, and melodically restrained, again bringing Russell to mind.More traditional strains of contemporary experimental music can at times be weighed down by their own history. And while Levi and Coates are clearly products of certain traditions, their influences are widespread. Tracks like the fragmentary “Xhill Stepping” or “New Wren Kitch,” which has the feel of an unraveling Actress B-side, nod to UK hip-hop and garage; scrawls of noise and vocal modulations bridge into brainy, gallery-bound sound work. The unfussy way Levi and Coates negotiate these references keeps this album from sounding like self-conscious pastiche. All the while, Remain Calm (like most of the projects Levi has been attached to) maintains a loping pace, easy and cool even as instrumental flourishes nervously flutter.The breadth of Levi’s career offers an exciting framework for a new generation of musicians looking to uproot themselves and move—as might be most intuitive in our contemporary cultural economy—in several directions at once. We sense less a linear evolution in her sound and more a continual, varied expansion, driven by collaborations like this that are rooted in improvisation, as well as more rigid, genre-driven assignments. (Coates, too, negotiates between projects this way: He played with the London Contemporary Orchestra on Radiohead’s A Moon Shaped Pool, for one, but this year also released Upstepping, a solo LP of oddball deep house.) Remain Calm is particularly refreshing for its relative approachability, no doubt the product of sly pop and dance sensibilities that are lodged somewhere in there alongside the open-ended phrases and sonic atmospherics. Even as its mood slides from pensive to morose to quietly exuberant, this remains throughout one of the more enjoyable experimental releases this year.\"],[22656,\"“The reality of dance music is that it encompasses more than just dance music,” the 25-year-old DJ and producer Jay Daniel recently told an interviewer asking about the Detroit music scene. He also seemed to be displaying his career ambitions in a single sentence. After several notable years as a prodigious house and techno talent, Daniel is cautiously expanding his purview. “I’m called a techno artist when really I’m a drummer,” he said. “I want to be referred to as a musician more so than a DJ.”Since 2013 the Detroit artist has shared a handful of scatterbrained 12”-single and EP releases, improving in strides along the way. The progression has been leading up to an official debut called Broken Knowz, his first long player and also the first time he’s fully centering live percussion in his production, shifting purposefully from programming drums in favor of channelling his own considerable chops. Daniel grew up in Detroit with his mother, the elusive soulful house singer Naomi Daniel, and then in Maryland with his father, where he picked up a pair of drumsticks and played throughout high-school. “I feel go-go had an effect on the way I see and hear music,” he once said of his time away from Detroit. “The cadence and syncopation is different from any other music. I could have played in a band, but it’s easier to make music by yourself.” Accordingly, this debut feels like a solitary affair, full of the type of obsessive layering that can only be accomplished by a single pair of hands. The nine songs on Broken Knowz brim with meticulous, meditative production, and Daniel’s drumming is a revelation throughout. Instead of chopping up his drum sounds and triggering them individually, the artist uses multiple tracks to layer and loop percussion takes he recorded in his mother’s Detroit basement. As a result, the rhythms on Broken Knowz sound alive and slinky, and somehow despite all the singular attention nothing on it sounds fussy.  Daniel diverts sounds like a sleight-of-hand artist. A busily tapped hi-hat clouds the driving kick-drum of “1001 Nights” before a clipping sound builds into a galloping rhythmic element. Like any artist making dance music, Daniel revels in repetition, and he digs up little revelations inside his evolving loops. It’s an easy, popular trick to build a track up by its components, and while Daniel frequently relies on song-length crescendos of complexity, he arranges his layers with nuance and restraint, introducing certain sounds as flashy highlights and others as inconspicuous building blocks.“Paradise Valley” is an obvious standout, and it’s also a bit of a red herring in its lush feel, a brilliant dose of shifty electronic funk that betrays some of the deeper and more austere grooves that follow. Unlike many of the songs on Broken Knowz, Daniel leads from the start with a shimmering synth that soars over a clanking percussive element. The producer taps a cowbell like a funky metronome in the right channel before a warbling synth lead rises and squirms above everything else. It’s busy and quirky, naturally just-so.In interviews and as a DJ, Jay Daniel comes off studious and workmanlike, hyper and humbly self-aware of the Detroit music scene he inhabits. With Broken Knowz he’s fully built up his own identity. The live drum sounds are an obvious advancement in the producer’s craft and personality, but he’s also doubling down in his Detroit diligence, digging deeper into his already deep house and techno roots with sharpened tools. He’s finding old ways to do new things.\"],[22669,\"It was probably overstated, but a few years ago the podcast 99% Invisible made a provocative argument for R.E.M.’s Out of Time as the most politically significant album in American history—not for its content, but for its packaging. The band, the story goes, was wary of releasing the CD in a longbox, the superfluous cardboard packaging that compact discs came in during the format’s early years, so an idealistic Warner Brothers executive pitched them on the idea of putting that wasted packaging to use. The back of the box would include a Rock the Vote petition lobbying senators to support a bill enabling citizens to register to vote at DMVs or through the mail. Those petitions flowed into Congress by the thousands, and the bill eventually passed, leading to a historic influx of new young voters.  The podcast’s numbers are a little fuzzy, so it may be a stretch to directly credit R.E.M. for the bill’s passage. But if nothing else, the story speaks to the band’s stature at the time. In 1991, R.E.M. weren’t just huge; they were important, and the Rock the Vote petition certainly wouldn’t have had the same impact if it hadn’t been packaged around such an enormously popular record. Out of Time gave the band their biggest hit single, netted them three Grammys, and eventually sold more than 18 million copies worldwide, numbers that insured the band the capital to do more or less whatever they wanted for the rest of their career. Along with Nevermind, released a half year later, it was the ideal every major label aspired to during their great independent-artist grab of the early ’90s: a blockbuster that multiplied the band’s following without ticking off existing fans.  Out of Time is a weird entry in R.E.M.’s discography, although in fairness the same can be said of almost every album R.E.M. released during that stretch. Numb from a year on the road, the band largely cast aside the usual electric guitars to fiddle with other instruments, most prominently the mandolin, which Peter Buck claimed he was still teaching himself when he stumbled upon the riff for “Losing My Religion.” Twenty-five years later, that single remains the most perfect pop song R.E.M. ever crafted, but it was hardly a fluke. The longing harpsichord on the album’s other great ballad, “Half a World Away,” is almost as enchanting, while the Beach Boys-bright “Near Wild Heaven” is almost overwhelming in its beauty and generosity. The whole record is flush with violins and cellos, revealing a range and sophistication that none of its predecessors had ever even hinted at.  Of course, Out of Time is sometimes remembered as much for its stylistic overreach as much as it is for all that elegance. It’s the album with “Country Feedback,” the rawest expression of sheer remorse the band ever captured on tape, but also the album with “Shiny Happy People,” a song that to this day many R.E.M. diehards would just as soon will out of existence. On one side it’s got bassist Mike Mills’ most sublime lead vocal turn on string-swept “Texarkana”; on the other it’s got KRS-One on “Radio Song” wailing like the Big Bopper over a wacky organ lick. Somehow, making one of the fiercest rappers of his era sound like such a colossal clown remains the album’s most perplexing legacy.  A quarter century removed from its release, though, those missteps are easy to write off as endearing period trappings. If anything, the album now sounds more like the masterpiece it felt just short of at the time, a work nearly on par with its more universally regarded, nocturnal sequel Automatic for the People. Warner Brothers’ anniversary reissue gives the album the usual deluxe treatment, with a second disc of demos mostly of interest for the glimpse they provide into the band’s process. “Losing My Religion,” for instance, is presented as both a somewhat uncertain instrumental and as a lean, string-less rock song. You can also hear Michael Stipe not quite hit the high notes on an early version of “Near Wild Heaven.”   Much more worthwhile is a third disc included on pricier versions of the reissue: a live, Unplugged-esque performance for a West Virginia public radio broadcast. Since the band had opted against a big tour behind Out of Time, they sound refreshed and just a little under-rehearsed. Stipe’s reverential, beat-poetry recitation of KRS-One’s “Radio Song” verse aside, the band goes out of their way not to take themselves too seriously. Mills leads a demure rendition of the Troggs’ flower-power standard “Love Is All Around,” then Billy Bragg and Robyn Hitchcock join in to bring some honky-tonk rowdiness to a giddy cover of Jimmie Dale Gilmore’s “Dallas.” R.E.M. were one of the biggest bands in the world, but even coming off of their most high-minded record to date—and performing on a day that West Virginia’s governor had christened “R.E.M. Day,” at that—they still sounded like the same gang of old friends who drunkenly recorded a jingle for their favorite barbeque spot for an early B-side. The weight of their newfound importance would eventually take a toll on the group. It hadn’t yet.\"],[22634,\"It’s good to remember the improbable things in life. For example: “Uptown Funk” vocalist and animatronic sequined suit Bruno Mars once sang the words “loungin’ on the couch just chillin’ in my Snuggie.” Every part of it is retroactively bizarre: the idea that Mars, the hardest-working embodiment of the “hardest-working man in showbiz” cliche, once attached himself to something called “The Lazy Song”; that he once aligned himself with flash-in-the-pan acoustic bros like Travie McCoy; or, more broadly, that he used to make pop in the 2010s that sounded like the 2010s. Much has been made of Mars’ childhood stint as an Elvis impersonator, with reason. The same talent that allowed a squeaky 4-year-old to channel, uncannily, the King’s gruff bark and distant whiff of scandal is the talent that allows Mars to inhabit whatever he wants. He’s as convincing a cheeky horndog (early hits with his production group the Smeezingtons include Flo Rida’s cheesy-sleazy hit “Right Round” and Mike Posner’s dubiously conceived “Bow Chicka Wow Wow”) as he is a worshipful loverman (the chaste stretch from “Nothin’ on You” through “Grenade”); he's as eager an omnivorous music fan (the Unorthodox Jukebox era remade Billy Joel and the Police as faithfully as any R&B or funk referents) as the comparatively laser-focused revivalist of 24K Magic. Also improbable: that “Uptown Funk,” still inescapable at weddings and stadiums near you, still has life in it, let alone an album’s worth. The title track to 24K Magic is all but an explicit retread: YSL swapped out for designer minks, Chucks for Inglewood’s finest shoes, corny “dragon wanna retire, man” line for corny line about red getting the blues, “Oops Upside Your Head” biting swapped out for only slightly less lawsuit-prone Zapp voiceover vocoders. What it lacks in a hook it makes up for (almost) with vibe, and more importantly, earnestness.  24K Magic, the album, sticks to the same well-trod path. It often comes off as a one-man recreation of Mark Ronson’s similarly retro-fetishist Uptown Special—Ronson himself was tapped early on as a potential collaborator—with one key difference: all roles here are filled by Mars. Aside from a couple guest production jobs by former collaborators Jeff Bhasker and Emile Haynie, the album is largely produced by Shampoo Press & Curl—a mildly reorganized incarnation of the Smeezingtons. And as Mars boasted in pre-album press, there are no features. The idea is that he needs no features. He’s become practically all things to all people—he has enough session-wonk credibility to appeal to the Grammy-voting industry types who’ve adopted Mars as a standard-bearer for Real Musicianship; he has enough pop and R&B cred to keep the radio listeners around; enough showmanship to pull off a Super Bowl halftime performance while barely into his career; enough wedding-reception goofiness to ingratiate himself to anyone left over. The line between lovingly recreating the music of the past and cynically 3D-printing it for easy profit is fine and much fretted-over, sometimes at book length. And indeed, 24K Magic aims to recreate a time and a vibe much of its personnel weren’t even around for. (Said producer and Mars collaborator Brody Brown of a side project that sounds suspiciously 24K Magic-adjacent: “It’s going to make you feel like 1985—even though I wasn’t born until 1989.”) But in a self-conscious Vegas-revival way, 24K Magic pulls it off. It helps that it compresses all Mars’ personae into one. Go back to Smeezingtons cowrite “Fuck You” and you’ll find a blueprint: a retro-obsessed guy who makes songs your great-uncle recognizes, that also happens to be really, really horny. It helps that the album is barely over 30 minutes and meticulously sequenced, and it also helps that Mars is a notorious perfectionist (in a Rolling Stone interview earlier this year, he bragged about the dozens of versions of these tracks that got scrapped because the vibe wasn't right; routine studio business, to be sure, but Mars evidently takes it more seriously than most).It helps that the past couple years have gradually whetted pop audiences’ appetite for sounds that might have once been considered too chintzy for top 40. “Perm” may be yet another attempt to revive James Brown, but while it isn’t quite as convincing as Mystikal’s would-be resurrection on Uptown Special, it does gives us the deliberate anachronism of a James Brown song with the line “forget your Instagram and your Twitter.” “That’s What I Like” is a song about opulence that sounds it—it’s sort of like what The 20\\/20 Experience thought it was—while “Versace on the Floor” and “Too Good to Say Goodbye” are as faithful recreations of mid-’90s R&B as you’ll find outside the decade, from the roller-rink synths of the former to the latter’s slow-dance power balladry (albeit one that, if it actually came out then, would mostly recall Luther doing “Superstar”).But most of all, it helps that Mars is a consummate performer; this kind of showmanship is  much more convincing, and coherent, from one showman than from one dilettante producer. If “Uptown Funk” was the theme-park version of one sliver of funk, 24K Magic is the rest of the park: rebuilt shinier and glitzier and safer, every element engineered to please more than the real thing, and with a hell of a tour guide. It’s not history, not even historical fiction, but harmless fun. \"],[22632,\"Keita Sano seems unsettled. This is true both in the producer's releases—15 singles and now four albums on 14 different labels, in two-plus years, and that's just accounting the physical releases—and his productions, which veer wildly from gnarly disco-based house to noisy, almost experimental techno to downtempo groove. The Okayama, Japan-based artist is probably most closely aligned with labels like Mister Saturday Night and 1080p, North American labels with a DIY spirit and a fondness for off-kilter statements, but even in that light Sano has proven himself a singular presence.Keita Sano is Sano's fourth album, give or take, and it arrives via Rett I Fletta, a sub-label of Prins Thomas' Full Pupp imprint, because for Sano anything worth doing is worth doing obtusely. Still, Keita Sano feels like the producer's most grounded and focused work yet: seven long tracks aimed at the dance floor, each one a treatise on how varied and dauntless Sano has become. These are tracks that fit into no particular paradigm or scene; they are stuffed with ideas, all of which hope to make you dance. Sano's debts to both house and techno are obvious—Thomas remarked he was drawn to how he “somehow managed to merge the playfulness of disco with the physical impact of techno”—but feel beside the point. Sano isn't a politician crossing the aisle, he's just grabbing whatever works.Accordingly, the tracks on Keita Sano are as familiar as they are hard to pin down. Squelchy acid licks (“Leave the Floor,” “Full of Love”) rub shoulders with filtered disco (“Honey”) and percussion loops of unknown origin (“Sucker Pt. 2”). “Vood” clangs with hissy industrial energy for more than three minutes before opening up into a calm, looping melody. Sano's tracks are long and evolving but there's very little psychedelia or escapism in his sound; everything is very physical and present, and his peculiar choices prevent you from losing yourself. Only on the closer, “None of Your Business,” when Sano slips into a kind of contented, deep house formalism, does Keita Sano fail to feel fidgety, strange, and emotive.This is, to a large extent, music for the heads: Sano is a precocious and enigmatic producer but Sano is unlikely to convert agnostics. For anyone inclined, though, Sano is a true talent, an artist for whom “sticking to his guns” is great because his guns are so much different than everyone else’s. Keita Sano is his calmest and most manageable work yet, a fine place to start tracking an artist who seems unlikely to sit still for long.\"],[22652,\"Tredici Bacci bandleader Simon Hanes really loves the work of Italian film composer Ennio Morricone. Hanes’ love isn't subtle. Even if he didn't discuss Morricone so much in the press, the Morricone influence literally screams out at you from the music on Tredici Bacci’s debut full-length, Amore Per Tutti. Deriving its title from Fellini’s Nino Rota-scored classic Juliet of the Spirits, Amore Per Tutti is nothing if not defined by Hanes’ college-age immersion into 1950s and ’60s Italian cinema as his attraction to Morricone grew into an obsession. It’s always a risky proposition when an artist references a specific influence with such laser focus. Listeners who lack the artist’s passion for the source material are likely to shrug, while fellow aficionados are bound to nitpick the music as not authentic enough on the one hand or too authentic on the other. Likeminded acts such as Antibalas, Debo Band, and Secret Chiefs 3 face a similar conundrum—and even inspire culture-vulture debates—with their respective modernizations of Afrobeat, Ethiopian, and Persian forms.To his credit, even as Hanes pilots the 14-piece Tredici Bacci through narrow stylistic straits, his enthusiasm burns through in the band’s exuberance. He also injects the music with a persistent sense of levity that the band sustains even during the album’s most soaring moments. Additionally, Hanes wrote these tunes as an attempt to extract the poppiest aspects of Morricone’s scores, which gives Amore Per Tutti a concise feel in spite of its grand orchestral sweep.On album opener “Columbo,” a grainy electric guitar figure blends seamlessly with horns that echo and harmonize against the same root notes while also heralding a grand arrival—the type of thing you might hear in an old Hollywood epic to invoke a sense of ancient Roman glory. Those horns do announce a grand arrival, but it comes in the form of a snakelike central hook with heavy traces of Greek\\/Turkish modality. The band maneuvers through such sequences with an impeccable agility that's easy to miss behind the music's melodramatic exterior.Meanwhile, the album doesn’t attempt to recreate the musty ambience of old film. Instead of making you feel like an archivist poring over film footage and academic texts written by grad students, the music's crisp production feels very much anchored in the moment, which only accentuates the music’s springy good-time bounce, and very nearly passes Morricone off as party music. (It would have to be a certain type of party, of course, but one imagines Hanes wants us to crank the music up and have fun rather than sit there namedropping cinematic references for sport.)On “Avante,” for instance, the band cranks-up the melodrama, as playful operatic vocals accompany a guitar line and galloping rhythm that are obviously fashioned in “spaghetti western” style. It’s funny, even goofy; in fact, it's hard to listen to a song like “Avante” without breaking into laughter, as you picture clip-clopping horses and the strangely distorted Italian conception of the American west. Hanes probably wouldn't have it any other way. \"],[22674,\"In the years following the 2007 release of the most recent Burial album, Untrue, we barely heard from the London producer born William Bevan. There was a 12” a couple of years later that found him collaborating with Four Tet, but nothing in terms of solo material until the 2011 EP Street Halo. With that release, what seemed at first to be a diversion until the next full-length came along turned out to be something more significant: Burial was shaping his music to fit a new format and finding inspiration in its limitations.The 12” vinyl EP, with a total playing time in the range of 20 to 30 minutes, proved to be the ideal canvas for new Burial creations. When no longer charged with sustaining a mood for LP length, he was able to pack more sounds and ideas into smaller spaces, incorporating rhythms from across the dance music spectrum and becoming more deft in his use of voices along the way. As important as Untrue may be to the recent history of electronic music, his EPs contain some of his finest work.The 12”s became annual “event” records that seemed all-too-happy to slip back into the ether; the last two, 2013’s Rival Dealer and 2012’s Truant\\/Rough Sleeper, came out in during the sleepy release month of December, after the year-end lists had been compiled, and when a new year of music was just around the corner. December ’14 and ’15 brought precious little Burial music, but then Black Friday brought a surprise in the form of a new Hyperdub 12”, “Young Death” b\\/w “Nightmarket.”It’s not quite fair to compare this record to the last four EPs, if only because this release is considerably shorter at 13 minutes. But the record feels comparatively minor in other ways. Each of the last few records introduced a new twist to the project, whether production density or a 4\\/4 house thump or an extra-musical idea, like the touching statement that Rival Dealer was designed as a balm for people subjected to bullying. As they arrived in succession, it was uncanny how much more Bevan could squeeze out of the narrow parameters of his style. But this 12” finds the project in a lull; it sounds like Burial (ghostly voices, clattering metal, vinyl crackle, funeral keyboard lines, all present and accounted for), which means it reaches a certain threshold for dark atmospheric beauty, but there’s very little to distinguish it otherwise.Beats for the two tracks are almost non-existent, which might suggest that the intention is something closer to ambient music, but the songs don’t stick around long enough to be immersive. “Young Death” features a lovely repeating vocal bit featuring the phrase “I will always be there for you,” underscoring the fact that warmth and empathy were always at the heart of the Burial project, but the voice floats freely, never connecting to its surroundings. “Nightmarket” is a touch more engaging and adds some jittery John Carpenter-style keyboard textures, but it too feels like it’s gathering itself for something that never arrives. Both tracks feel like small pieces of a larger piece we don’t get to hear; there’s a wispy, vaporous, interlude quality to each, like we’re in a place where something just happened or something is about to happen but the present moment is all suggestion. \"],[22670,\"If you’ve gone outside in Los Angeles County since November 8, you’ve heard “FDT.” YG and Nipsey Hussle’s skeletal protest song—the one that made the Secret Service come knocking all the way back in April—had a brief run during the primaries, but became an anthem shortly after the election was called for The Donald. “I like white folks, but I don’t like you”: Within 24 hours of the election results, there were effigies burning at City Hall and protesters choking off the 110. “I’m ‘bout to turn Black Panther”; across Temple and down Figueroa, through South Central and over to the Beaches, the song rattled from Priuses and pickup trucks and seventh-story windows. “And if your ass do win, you gon’ probably get smoked.”The overtly political is nothing new for YG. He’s been handing out groceries and school supplies with Compton mayor Aja Brown; he ended his sophomore album, Still Brazy with a three-song suite that tackled gross, race-based injustice. The first was “FDT,” but the next two (“Blacks and Brown” and “Police Get Away Wit Murder”) take aim at a state that can be murderous no matter who’s at the helm. And so with Red Friday, the new seven-song EP dropped on short notice, YG is back on the throttle, rushing ahead, nearly unbothered.Red Friday finds him darting across the Pro Tools sessions, more nimble than he’s ever been before. Sonic landmarks of L.A. rap come and go over the course of the record, but the tempo is constantly being pushed. Some of that comes courtesy of DJ Mustard, YG’s longtime creative partner who was completely absent from Still Brazy after the two had a personal falling out. “Get Out Yo Feelin’s” in particular is a testament to their rediscovered chemistry: Mustard’s eerie undertones and breathless drums make YG and RJ’s wisecracks from the club sounds sinister, even unhinged. And “Down Bitch,” which should be a pretty rote song about loyal girlfriends, comes out sounding like a Christmas carol that took too much ketamine.There’s no songwriting on Red Friday as instantly quotable as “Twist My Fingaz” or as sneakily brilliant as “Bool, Balm, & Bollective,” but what YG ends up rapping is tight and economical—and occasionally vivid. “I Be On,” an unfeeling rebuff to main girls and side girls alike is delivered gleefully, then qualified by acknowledging the drink in his hand. On “I Know,” he opens his verse with a three-bar riff on Houston one-hit wonder Mike Jones’ existence, then doubles down on his taunts to those rappers who need handholding to make the transition from grassroots fame to national stardom.But without question, the crown jewel of Red Friday is “One Time Comin’,” a frenzied blur of guns and paranoia. YG gets pulled over by a police officer, presumably because someone with his complexion shouldn’t be driving a Maybach; his mind darts to the last moments he was able to spend with his baby daughter. It ends with a bridge that couldn’t be more unambiguous, a complete rebuke of the Los Angeles Police Department and those who support it. That YG decided to deliver it over such an urgent beat—and on such short notice that his label might have fumbled the release—is simply a nod to the days we live in. There’s not much time to waste.\"],[22646,\"You Blew It! frontman Tanner Jones once sang, “I’m tired of all these toss ups and all this feigned motivation\\/But I’ve always felt fine singing in your basement,” but that was two years ago—before they played much bigger rooms opening for pop-punk institutions Taking Back Sunday, Motion City Soundtrack, and the Wonder Years. In interviews for their third LP Abendrot, Jones commented that “at some point you start to become less pleased with songs you wrote for basements and living rooms.” For a young band on an upward career arc, this might indicate an embrace of the loud, obvious gestures necessary to level up: a preemptive non-apology to the hardcore, protective fanbase as a much larger one awaits. But as with the most recent work of Modern Baseball, Sorority Noise, and Turnover, you get the sense from the inquisitive and insular Abendrot that You Blew It! simply saw a bigger version of “the basement” on those tours, a mental and spiritual holding cell where bands always have to be pop-punk, both sonically and lyrically. And so Abendrot is borne of You Blew It!’s desire to engage with the outside world, not to dominate it. As some of modern emo’s proudest traditionalists, You Blew It! know how to signify “mature third LP”: beginning with a solo, homesick introduction is a good start, as is calling it “Epaulette.” In fact, most of the song titles likewise abide by the time-honored emo-band practice of exchanging quirk and in-jokes for thesaurus-thumbing (“Autotheology,” “Kerning”), geographical signifiers (“Greenwood,” “Arrowhead”) and neologism (“Minorwye”).This continues the trajectory of their 2015 EP Pioneer of Nothing, which did away with the spittle-flecked spite of their best-known songs, “Award of the Year Award” and “The Fifties.” But while Abendrot is a natural progression, it’s rarely effortless: particularly during its first half, You Blew It! audibly have to restrain themselves from their old habits. “Like Myself” and “Sundial Song” are littered with lyrics that wouldn’t be out of place on Grow Up, Dude (“I don’t feel like myself or anyone else,” “I can’t control my insides!”), but rather than careening into the choruses, the band pulls back on the distortion and shifts rhythms, doing whatever it takes to avoid the cutting one-liners and slashing power chords that Jones once felt were necessary.Even at their most aggressive, the guitars on a You Blew It! song were unabashedly pretty, and while Into It. Over It.’s Evan Weiss returns to produce, Abendrot discards the lush, saturated sound of Keep Doing What You’re Doing for something more subdued. This isn’t slick by any means, but it reframes the leaves-bare placidity and exploratory interplay of Mineral’s EndSerenading, American Football, and Sunny Day Real Estate’s second LP into pop-punk song structure.More notably, Jones’ lyrical concerns are no longer directed at you and the countless ways in which you’ve disappointed him. Jones is mostly confused about his own place in the world, of how to live in the moment with an overactive brain and how to move forward despite a crippling fear of failure. Though less vindictive and more reflective, the underlying emotions aren’t all that different than they were on previous You Blew It! records, and Jones can capture their essence on a memorably worded chorus without shouting it: “when God dies, I’ll skip the funeral,” he moans during the Manchester Orchestra-ted grunge lurch of “Autotheology.”But when Jones seems compelled to transmogrify his thoughts into art, he ends up twisting himself into knots: “When the skin and vessels underneath\\/Choose this space for bruising\\/I’m somewhere in between\\/Clumsily pulling on the strings”; “If I could lay down, I’d let my cells accept the grounds.” It’s easy to figure out what Jones is trying to get at, but Abendrot’s lyrics often feel like writing for the sake of writing, labored rather than layered.Like anyone else who recently graduated from college and is trying to create a clear boundary between their earlier life and adulthood, Jones recognizes his desire for growth but searches for something palpable to push for. It’s common and relatable stuff, and Abendrot never feels dishonest, just occasionally overwrought in its desire to achieve the stakes and transcendence of similarly inspired records like Holy Ghost or Goodness. Fortunately, You Blew It! just as often let their guitars speak for their behalf and Abendrot can be heard as the completion of a directive started by their last two albums: grow up, dude and keep doing what you’re doing.\"],[22535,\"There are times—times of year, times in life, times in an election cycle, maybe—that an escape is needed. Or a cushion for a weary head. Or a curtain to block out the world. Ambient music is often good for that. It can be comfort music, security-blanket music, spark-a-joint-and-go-to-sleep music. As Kevin Drumm once put it, in a song title from his 2009 album Imperial Horizon, “Just Lay Down and Forget It” music.But some ambient music manages to stretch, however gingerly, beyond those fallback modes. It can soothe, yet still make you curious. It can calm and unsettle in equal measure. Brian Eno said that ambient music should be “as ignorable as it is interesting.” But what gets forgotten in that formulation is that ambient music, at least the really good stuff, should also be as interesting as it is ignorable.You may find yourself replaying a piece of music like that multiple times in a single sitting—not just because it’s appealingly immersive, but because every time it plays, there’s a question that goes unanswered. It might be a question you can’t really articulate. It might have to do with process: how the music was made, or what time signature it’s in, or something more abstruse, like where the notes end and the effects begin. (These aren’t necessarily things you even think about consciously, but you tease them out nonetheless, tugging at them like you might with a bar puzzle while your mind was far away.) Maybe you simply don’t know quite how it makes you feel. And in some circumstances—say, for instance, that you know that you otherwise feel just shit-awful—that openness is a good thing. It creates a space of possibility.Back in the early years of the decade, Suzanne Kraft—Los Angeles’ Diego Herrera, who today lives in Amsterdam—was making Metro Area-influenced house and disco, springy and dubby and slow, good music for the early or very late hour on the dancefloor. By last year’s Talk From Home, also for London’s Melody As Truth label, he had eased into a more contemplative mode: gentle synthesizers, clean-toned guitar, lilting cadences flecked with the LinnDrum’s telltale ping-pong thwack. Much in the vein of his label-mate Jonny Nash’s group Gaussian Curve, it was airy and spacious, and its final track, “The Result,” hinted at something even more ethereal in its beatless synths and fretless bass.His new album picks up where “The Result” left off. Across much of it, there is almost nothing there beyond synthesizers, a few stray horns, and faint echo in place of connective tissue. Even the cuts with drums are essentially ambient in feel: In “Bank,” a song reminiscent of both K. Leimer and Shy Layers, a tentative drum groove frames watery synths and tendrils of guitar. Something about its overlapping layers makes it difficult to determine where phrases begin and end, and it sways gently back and forth, like a small craft rocked by waves. “One Amongst Others” moves with a similar sort of fast\\/slow tempo, and it counts out in five-bar phrases instead of four—a structural quirk that leaves you feeling off balance, even if you don’t realize it. Its cool, brooding chords, meanwhile, also have an unsettled air, shifting back and forth in search of the root note like a cat choosing a place to lie down.Those are the most substantial tracks. “Fragile” offers just two sets of chords fluttering in counterpoint; quiet, scratchy bursts of distortion emphasize the outer surface of the sound, and a momentary bend in pitch gives the impression that the music is about to slide off the tape entirely. The wintry “Zé” is just muted tones and atonal squiggles that move like startled birds. And “Scripted Space,” warm as a freshly baked batch of muffins, is similarly minimalist, with arpeggios tripping up the scale and trickling back down through the delay chain. The sequence of notes is so fleet and slippery that you can’t quite fix upon them, certainly not enough to sing them back to yourself. The delay functions not as a crutch but as a channel, a conduit—not a way of filling space, but of revealing it.The bookending “Body Heat” and “Further” are more lyrical—particularly the opener, with its mournful, drifting saxophones—but they’re hardly much more substantial; they seem more like conjuring acts than compositions. It’s striking how much Herrera manages with such meager materials. It’s not that the music is calming, which it is; it’s the way it gets under your skin, the way the ripples on the surface suggest hidden forces below. This short, gently melancholy album offers solace while rejecting the soporific. It is a cushion to fall back upon—one just springy enough, perhaps, to set you in motion again.\"],[22668,\"Who is the Weeknd? That’s the question a lot of us asked when the act first materialized, fully-formed, with 2011’s House of Balloons. Thanks to the group’s savvy anti-publicity campaign, the question had a literal bent: who are the people who made these songs? Fast-forward five years and there’s little mystery remaining when it comes to the provenance of the Weeknd’s music—like so many modern pop songs, his are now designed in consultation with a committee of experts. And yet, even as we watch Abel Tesfaye walk the red carpet in the light of day, the question remains: Who is the Weeknd? Is he a drugged-out lothario? A beloved pop star? A nihilist foil to Drake? The second coming of Michael Jackson? The runaway success of last years’ Beauty Behind the Madness—two No. 1 singles and over two million units sold in the U.S.—seemed like it might finally force an answer to this question. And yet, Starboy, the Weeknd’s sixth overall album and third for a major label, only further muddies the waters.Initially, there were signs that Starboy would represent a much-needed pivot, a rethinking of a sound and image that seemed to have run its course, from DIY mixtapes to the top of the charts. The album’s lead video features Tesfaye murdering a past version of himself before taking a cross-shaped bat to a condo full of awards and sales plaques. Starboy, however, is hardly a dramatic reinvention—if anything, it feels like a watered-down retread of the same old tropes. Beauty Behind the Madness managed to smuggle sleaze into the mainstream by refining Tesfaye’s pop songcraft, even as it doubled down on the darkness. Starboy eases up on both fronts, recycling melodies, ideas, and even whole songs while presenting a sanitized version of the Weeknd that often lacks any real sense of perspective. It’s a curious move for a guy who so decisively managed to succeed on his own terms.As if to guarantee that it feels like a slog, Starboy is also overstuffed: over an hour of music stretching out over 18 songs, many of them bland. “Rockin’” sounds like a label executive’s idea of what the Weeknd could be: inoffensive club pop tailor-made for office karaoke parties (“I just want your body next to me\\/’Cause it brings me so much ecstasy\\/We can just be rockin’, yeah”). “False Alarm” snatches defeat from the jaws of victory, its sublime opening harmonies devolving into a screamed chorus that’s as contrived as Michael Jackson’s bellow at the beginning of “Scream.” “Six Feet Under,” a collaboration with Future, is essentially just a rewrite of the pair's much sharper “Low Life” (“Reminder” also recycles the vocal melody from “Low Life”); both here and on “All I Know,” the melodically-gifted rapper feels sorely underutilized. Kendrick Lamar’s verse on the autotune-heavy “Sidewalks” is characteristically dexterous but even he sounds a bit unenthused to be here. It’s hard to blame him.There are a few bright spots on Starboy, moments that feel guided by a stronger vision. Both of the Daft Punk collaborations are satisfying, if hardly groundbreaking; “Starboy” glides like a sleek, high-performance car, while “I Feel It Coming” sounds like a slowed-down version of “Get Lucky.” “Secrets” pushes the Weeknd’s nocturnal sound into new wave territory, borrowing washes of clean guitar from Tears for Fears’ “Pale Shelter” and lifting the chorus from the Romantics’ “Talking in Your Sleep” wholesale. “True Colors” sounds like a ’90s R&B slow burner produced by Noah “40” Shebib (who was once apocryphally rumored to have ghost produced for the Weeknd). And “Ordinary Life” proves that Tesfaye is still more than capable of raising eyebrows, opening with a vivid description of fellatio behind the wheel before taking a hard left into petite mort fatalism (“David Carradine, I’ma die when I come”).Starboy’s most interesting song is barely even a song. The two-minute-long “Stargirl Interlude,” finds Lana Del Rey reprising her role as Tesfaye’s foil, relating a pornographic “vision” over a minimal backing track, before Tesfaye closes out the song by cooing, “I just want to see you shine, ’cause I know you are a Stargirl.” The brief snippet is filled with the sort of tension that’s so lacking from most of Starboy, playing up the theatrics for which both artists are known. “I feel like we’ve always been talking to each other through our music,” Tesfaye said of Del Rey in an interview last year. “She is the girl in my music, and I am the guy in her music.” Here, the pair embrace that meta-narrative, responding to their perceived lack of authenticity by retreating fully into the pop fantasy where their characters connect. It’s a boldly self-aware move, one that smartly manages to wring art from artifice.Starboy could use a lot more of this kind of audacity or really, any kind of coherent storytelling that challenges, complicates or further illuminates our understanding of the unfeeling villain that Tesfaye has been playing since day one. Instead, we get a grab bag of difficult to reconcile contradictions: a “Party Monster,” on one track, a doe-eyed balladeer on another (“Die for You”). Tesfaye used to be near-obsessive about packaging projects that felt narratively whole—after all, this is the guy who released an entire trilogy of interconnected albums in his first year. Starboy, by way of contrast, feels more like an opportunistic compilation of B-sides than an album. Who is the Weeknd? At this point, even the man behind the curtain might not know.\"],[22650,\"Three years out from PC Music’s inception, it would be rash to deny the label\\/genre\\/cultural microphenomenon’s influence—not just in terms of the sheer number of think-pieces generated in its wake, but in the trickle-down of its aesthetic signatures. Take, for example, the breathy single “3 Strikes” by maybe-Kylie Jenner-fronted teen-pop act Terror Jr. The song’s otherwise unimaginative pop skeleton (lilting beat, insipid lyrics) is rendered magnetic through chilly vocal manipulation and melodic elements, which are at once dreamlike and austere. In other words, it sounds like an A.G. Cook production on a fistful of downers. This is not to mention the expertly-constructed hype around the band itself: an anonymous female vocalist, a debut via a lipgloss advertisement—straight from the PC playbook.Gradually seeping into the mainstream is par for the course for electronic music subcultures, but Cook and company are a bit more insistent in the totality of their goals. By one description, 2016 is the year that PC Music “grabbed the mainstream by the throat and made it take notice.” But listening to the PC Music, Vol. 2 compilation, I felt less subsumed and more worn out. Is it feasible for a microgenre that’s all candy-coating, all self-consciously hyper-“contemporary” veneer, to expect to sustain itself long-term? And, while this perhaps overestimates the sincerity of PC Music’s mission, is it possible that such mainstream-seizing objectives are built around a faulty understanding of how culture flows? In any event, PC Music, Vol. 2 collects 10 tracks, most previously released, which follow the blueprint laid out by last year’s Vol. 1. Though the tracks clock in at varying degrees of hyperactivity (GFOTY’s full-throttle “Poison” perhaps the worst of the bunch for the high-BPM-averse), each reaches for anthem status. The productions cobble together and iron over a mix of styles appropriated from both the dance underground and Top 40, with results that are structurally varied, but with a uniform surface. Among the better offerings is easyFun’s “Monopoly,” whose bouncy hook is propelled by clean synths and infantile vocal manipulation. Felicita’s “a new family” seethes, horror-film whispers emerging from underneath the sort of crunchy torrent of sound favored by so-called post-club producers. Some songs bridge directly into a stylized take on radio pop—Danny L Harle’s Carly Rae Jepsen-featuring “Super Natural,” for example, a disquietingly innocent hit that could easily have been underwritten by the Disney Channel. If this compilation evidences any real evolution in the PC Music sound, it’s in this assimilated direction: less sinister, more widely marketable. As a conceptual project that embraces HD aesthetics wholesale, PC Music has always felt dated to me; it’s in this context that comparisons to post-internet art—variously unflattering to either camp, depending on your vantage point—seem most apt. Its desire to comment on the hypermediated nature of being young today is similarly tiresome: lyrics often conjure a lonely girl on her phone, waiting for a notification to advance the plot, a rather flattened image of sexuality and longing. Can’t we agree by now that, however smooth our screens, technology tends more often to reveal and amplify an inherent messiness in human relationships? This is not to mention the genre’s overwhelming whiteness, or its tendency to treat women as avatars, recurring points that rather definitively undermine PC Music’s critical capabilities. But a masterfully constructed pop song can be indelible, and if you peel back the ill-advised art-project histrionics, there are a handful of those here. Harle’s “Broken Flowers,” first released in 2013, is an excellent piece of cyborg house, addictive but never overwhelming. “Only You,” by Chinese pop star Chris Lee—one of the biggest-ticket names and a rare non-white collaborator, it is worth noting, for a group of producers so transparently indebted to East Asian pop culture—builds at a treacly pace, as the minimalist structure fills with textural scrawls that cut the sweetness. It’s this, not the messaging, that is worth hanging onto. \"],[22651,\"Way back in the 10-cent bin, between the 40-odd copies of Whipped Cream & Other Delights and those “Sounds of Hawaii” records made exclusively by people who'd never set foot on Hawaii, Monster Rally’s Ted Feighan has found paradise. “Exotica,” we used to call it: “Space-age bachelor pad music,” that sort of thing. Feighan, having lifted dozens of samples from the original, often-warped wax, realigns them into a sparkling, sun-soaked collage, deftly sliding between opulent slack-key guitars, clattering breakbeats, and shimmering tropicalia, like the Avalanches stuck in Honolulu with visa issues, or the Caretaker on daquiri three. Mystery Cove, the fourth Monster Rally full-length, is pure, distilled escapism: 42 straight minutes of somewhere else, no SPF required.Feighan largely works in miniature—few Monster Rally tracks run too far past the two minute mark—without much apparent use for vocals. While early highlight “In the Valleys” lifts a few lines from hapa-haole classic “Lahainaluna,” the paucity of voices throughout the rest of Mystery Cove gives the disc its air of seclusion, a paradise far removed from the madding crowd. From chopped-not-slopped big band ditties (“Moondog”) to swanky hold music\\/“Hotline Bling” schmaltz (“Full Sail,” “After Hours”) to lusty, Herb Ritts-lensed sandblasters (“Tourismo”), this is transporting work.Mystery Cove isn’t a real place, but Feighan’s fondness for certain sounds (lounge, surf, slack-key guitar) sourced from a certain era (1948-1964, give or take) neatly conjures one anyway: beautiful people, endless beaches, fruit-based cocktails. Alas, like any vacation, Mystery Cove too often cuts things short just when they’re getting good. For all his curatorial prowess, Feighan tends to winnow down his Goodwill findings into 10-or-15 second chunks. There’s plenty of variation between the tracks, just not necessarily much within them; occasionally, a breakbeat is introduced, or a clip will run headlong into another, but the general rule seems to be “cut, spin, fade, repeat.” While that certainly keeps things moving, there’s rarely enough time within individual tracks to get acclimated to the scenery when Feighan’s anxiously clicking his way through the slideshow.As an exercise in vibe-sustainment, Mystery Cove is a knockout. To that end, it’s probably the most cohesive Monster Rally record to date: a Hawaiian shirt with an AUX input. But that cohesion comes comes at the cost of a bit of adventure; whereas 2013’s more baldly experimental Return to Paradise found Feighan drawing slivers of samba and sweeping mid-century soundtrack work into his world party, Mystery Cove rarely makes it too far off the Big Island. Most of us will take our escapism where we can get it nowadays, and Feighan’s only too happy to provide.\"],[22596,\"The 1970s was Steve Reich’s decade; although he had already completed groundbreaking phase pieces It’s Gonna Rain, Come Out, and Violin Phase by the end of the ‘60s, the ten-year run that followed was something else entirely. Starting with Drumming in 1971, moving through the epochal Music for 18 Musicians and passing into the early ’80s with the beautiful Tehillim, Reich married his early structural innovations to a singular, aqueous melodicism that rocketed him out of the downtown NY avant-garde into as close to the mainstream as it is possible for a modern composer to be. Six Pianos—written in between Drumming  and 18 Musicians and released to accompany the show-stealing Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ—is a solid fan favorite, a lovely piece of music that fits perfectly between the larger, more definitive works. Once you know what to expect from the composer, Reich’s work from this era does exactly what it says on the box: there are six pianos, playing overlapping developments and variations on deceptively simple melodic figures for the piece's duration. Development will happen, but in a such a supple fashion you will be hard pressed to remember what was different between the start of the piece and its conclusion. Everything has shifted, yet nothing has changed.  Something similar can be said for the various recordings of Reich’s work. One sinks into the music so easily that different iterations can seem only incrementally distinct from each other. This new LP issued by Berlin’s FILM Recordings reprises a recent performance by an ensemble featuring, among others, members of chamber-techno upstarts Brandt Brauer Frick and promises “Six Pianos the way it should be looked at in 2016.” To achieve this, each player recorded their individual part alone, in separate studios, later combining the layers into a unified whole. The result offers a distinct perspective on Pianos, though perhaps not an improvement.Reich’s music is quintessentially New York, with precise, percolating rhythms and a subtle melancholy evoking nothing more than the simple pleasures of darting through a hectic Manhattan on a crisp autumn afternoon. Part of the joy of his larger ensemble works is the lush crowding of instruments, with different voices smearing together, suddenly poking out before receding back into the mix. On this recording, however, each line is rendered with stunning clarity and separation. It’s a move that’s in line with the times, with ensembles like So Percussion and Alarm Will Sound offering virtuosic updates of classic pieces, and makes for an intriguing listen. The clockwork qualities of Reich’s music are brought to the front, and you can focus immediately on any part you like, letting the rest move around you. However, some of the richness and emotion that make this work so enduring are dulled in favor of a tidy tastefulness. In their youth, minimalist composers had to fight hard against lazy attempts to classify their work as New Age, and the players here seem determined to emphasize the elemental rigor of the piece. But although Reich was never utopian in his goals, he was also unafraid of drawing human pathos out from his looping melodies.The B-side is a rendition of Terry Riley’s Keyboard Study #1 that goes further in its modern updates. Riley’s original score is written in billowing, hippie chicken scratch and reads more like a brain teaser than a piece of music: “The two kinds of figures interlock and are repeated in this fashion until one of the hands selects another figure… combine any figure from lines 2-6 with continuum figure 1… if any figure from lines 8-10 is played in the alignment of continuum figure 7… it may be combined with other figures from lines 8-10.” And so on. Ensemble member Gregor Schwellenbach performed the piece solo and put together the final mix with assistance from engineer Lukas Vogel, who added delays and reverbs. The work, open to interpretation, here becomes a series of tight, consonant piano runs that double over each other in dizzying spirals. An early work of Riley’s, Study #1 laid the groundwork for his iconic A Rainbow in Curved Air and subsequent masterpieces like Persian Surgery Dervishes. Intuitive, often darkly psychedelic explorations of textures and loops performed during druggy “all night flights,” these pieces presaged techno by over a decade. Now an ensemble with roots in modern club music has returned to the source material, and though you would never confuse this record for a DJ tool, you can hear a familial bond. Back in 1999, Nonesuch released the Reich Remixed compilation, where a splashy array of electronic producers were invited to explore his back catalogue. A case has always been made for Reich’s relationship to minimal dance music, but aside from the obvious use of repetition that both share, I’ve never seen it, and the compilation struck me as a ham-fisted attempt to gussy up his image for a new generation. This LP is something else entirely. As electronic production has become the new normal and generations upon generations of producers continue to stretch the possibilities of dance music, techno has itself become an elder statesman's genre. Festivals like CTM and Unsound have made their name juxtaposing DIY electronics, touring DJs, loner ambient composers and new music ensembles, and left-of-center artists like Andy Stott, Demdike Stare, and Lee Gamble regularly shuttle between the club and the art world. This LP serves as a worthy and timely addition to the composers’ catalogues, but after finishing this version of Six Pianos, I found myself reaching for my beat up copy of Reich’s 1986 re-orchestration for marimbas. And when it was done, I reached for it again. \"],[22644,\"Justice’s 2007 debut album, †, was expertly engineered for breakthrough success, delivering massive hooks with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. That said, they also had an impeccable sense of timing. Shortly after reigniting public interest in their catalog with the landmark Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk—Justice’s direct antecedents—largely powered down until the release of 2013’s Random Access Memories. It’s difficult to overstate how much Justice benefitted from this timing, riding a renewed wave of interest in French house just as it was cresting, then stepping into a world hungry for Daft Punk as their closest analogues: two enigmatic French dudes forcing electro-disco through the sieve of hard rock dynamics. They certainly made the most of the opportunity on the live circuit, with ear-splitting arena tours that predicted the rise of pyrotechnic technicians like Skrillex and Deadmau5. Still, for all their success, Justice always felt like Daft Punk’s understudies: cruder, grimier, more willing to dredge rock’s cheesiest depths in search of a big hook.That formula worked well in 2007 but now that Daft Punk is active and operating at pop’s highest echelons, does the world still need Justice? That’s the question the scruffy duo have been attempting to answer ever since. To their credit, they’ve hardly stood still: 2011’s Audio, Video, Disco found the act taking a hard left turn toward prog in order to distinguish themselves. Woman, their  latest, marks yet another tonal shift away from the leather-clad sonics of their debut and toward the brighter sounds of pop and disco.They’ve stored away the crates of vinyl once and for all, padding out their synthcraft with live instrumentation and vocalists. As with previous Justice albums, Woman is full of earnest vocals, rubber-band basslines and weepy strings, only this time everything sounds much warmer and looser. Intentional or not, it’s hard not to see the parallels to Random Access Memories’ pop classicism and militantly analog approach. Just as Daft Punk did, Justice attempt to envelop the sounds of disco and funk in a full on, unironic embrace. And while they remain more willing to violate the rules of good taste (as always, all the faders are at 10 and they continue cramming everything into the midrange), Woman still feels about as “electronic” as RAM does: it largely scans as AM pop, just with more modular synths.Justice being Justice, they can’t resist trying to land a few big singles and these songs tend to be the least adventurous on the album. “Safe and Sound” and “Stop” both attempt to recreate the winning formula of “D.A.N.C.E.”: stargazing choirs, layers of synths, a generous helping of slap bass. At best though, these songs feel like paint-by-numbers versions of Justice’s early singles. In between these throwbacks, we get a lot of middle-of-the-road pop: generically funky melodies, cheesy guitar solos, forgettable vocals, lyrics that are downright embarrassing. It’s not quite offensive but that’s also kind of the problem—much of Woman sounds like music designed by committee, better suited to soundtrack a car commercial than to actively engage the listener (incidentally, Justice do have a pretty strong track record when it comes to landing commercial and video game placements).There are a few moments on Woman where Justice break from the script and most of them are far more memorable than the rest of the record. “Chorus” opens up with drone-y blasts of static that pop up again in the track’s airy back half. “Heavy Metal” kicks off with an Iron Butterfly meets Van Halen organ solo before segueing into a disjointed chorus that recalls Ed Banger’s heyday. “Alakazam !” goes all in on the record’s guiding sound: it’s a straight up four-on-the-floor disco number grafted on to the sort of grungy synth bassline that these guys wield so well. If you’re going to embrace corniness, why not really go for it?While it’s hard to fault them for wanting to explore new terrain, as with Audio, Video, Disco, Woman’s focus largely plays against the pair’s strengths as songwriters. There’s a restraint on display that, coming from Justice, feels more like a lack of commitment. Is Woman more subtle and loosely composed than their previous records? Sure. Are those qualities desirable in a Justice album? Perhaps not. Ever since their emergence, electronic traditionalists have been wringing their hands over these guys but until now there was at least one thing you could never accuse Justice of being: boring.\"],[22649,\"For the first few years of their career, Demdike Stare narrowed in on their chosen aesthetic with unswerving focus. They took their name from a 17th-century witch; they favored titles like “Suspicious Drone” and “All Hallows Eve” and “Forest of Evil (Dusk).” Drawing from horror soundtracks, Italian library music, African percussion records, and industrial acts like Nurse With Wound, they boiled down the mixture until it resembled the sticky black substance scraped from the bottom of an iron cauldron. At the same time, the proportions of their music sprawled, and they turned to increasingly ambitious formats—triple CDs, quadruple LPs—to suit their meandering, multi-part ambient suites.In 2013, the duo turned from their habitual style to indulge themselves with a pair of gut-punching club tunes. Called simply Testpressing #001, the record was named in homage to the white-label platters used to check for errors in the vinyl manufacturing process, but the title also spoke to the tracks’ exploratory purpose: What would happen if they applied their doomy aesthetic to classic jungle and techno? (Total dancefloor mayhem, as it turned out.) Pursuing a grab-bag approach and pairing radically different tracks on each successive 12”, they kept the Testpressing series going for six more installments—only Demdike Stare would approach even one-offs in serial fashion—and although the music varied widely, from UK garage to chopped-and-screwed breakbeat hardcore, the records all shared the same questing nature.Their new album, Wonderland, keeps up those beat-oriented experiments. Nearly all of its tracks are built around muscular rhythms: hardcore breaks, lurching dancehall cadences, overdriven techno. And despite the omnipresent shadowy hues and sandblasted textures, no two tunes sound alike; the eight full-length tracks here (the ninth is a minute-long ambient sketch) could easily have served as the next four records in the Testpressing series. That’s not to say that Wonderland sounds disjointed. Quite to the contrary: As wonderfully immersive as their first couple of albums could be, the new one makes for a far more engaging listening experience, one that shakes you forcefully by the lapels at regular intervals. Where the Testpressing records were noxious and smoggy, so thick with static you could barely breathe, the new album frequently takes inspiration from dancehall reggae’s use of empty space. “Animal Style” loops breakbeats into a snapping groove that feels like a reggae 45 spun at 33, and “FullEdge (eMpTy-40 Mix)” goes so far as to sample “Now Thing,” a 1998 Sly & Lenky riddim that became the centerpiece of an eponymous Mo Wax compilation of dancehall instrumentals. (It’s clearly a sound close to their hearts: Earlier this year, Demdike Stare’s DDS label released Equiknoxx’s Bird Sound Power, an album by a group of Jamaican producers deeply inspired by the kind of digital dancehall that Now Thing spotlighted.)There are moments of real beauty, like the flickering loop of tone that sends the final track, “Overstaying,” soaring toward its 808-driven climax. But the musicians aren’t afraid to get messy, either. In “Sourcer,” a ragged ragga-jungle anthem, dubbed-out synths bob like fat globules in soapy water; “Hardnoise” delivers exactly what the title promises, at least until a trim 808 pattern ushers its metal-shop squeals toward a comparatively dulcet ambient close. Something that elevates Wonderland above reams of color-by-numbers “dark” techno is Demdike Stare’s judicious sense of dynamics; the duo also clearly have a wicked sense of humor. They’re fond of fake-out beats that hiccup, stumble, and flip into totally different time signatures, and the switchbacking changes of “FullEdge (eMpTy-40 Mix)” suggest a preference for hands-on recording and white-knuckled mixdowns, as opposed to meticulous, on-screen composition. The end of the song dissolves into a monstrous bit of noise, followed by a sharp guffaw from one of the musicians; suddenly, we’re eavesdropping on the duo in their studio. “Amazing,” says the other, clearly pleased with the madness they’ve cooked up.My favorite moment on the album might be the spoken-word snippet that closes out the woozy synth sketch “Fridge Challenge.” It’s just a loudspeaker announcement inside an airport terminal—“TAP Flight 3814 to Brasilia now boarding gate 28”—but the announcer’s voice is so full of character, her diction so alien, that within the context of the album, it takes on a weird, almost paranormal resonance. You can imagine the two musicians staring slack-jawed at each other as they pulled out their phones to record the sound, marveling at what they’d stumbled upon. To make mood music out of already gloomy materials is easy; on Wonderland, Demdike Stare spin the most unexpected stuff into music for haunted dancehalls, and the results are wickedly compelling.\"],[22583,\"It’s been a few years since Matmos’ label Vague Terrain released a piece of new music, and for the most part Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt have called the organization a “vanity label” to release their own work and play around. In 2002, they even used Vague Terrain as a pseudonym to record the soundtrack for a fetish-heavy pornographic film. “Every so often we hear something completely gobsmacking and feel that we MUST share it with the world,” the pair wrote on their website to suddenly announce the revival of their label.The project that so shocked them is the debut album of Bully Fae, a queer Los-Angeles based multimedia artist. Defy a Thing to Be is the artist’s first formal release, but they (Fae prefers not to be gendered) have been sharing performance pieces  and fragments of the album, which mixes rapping, stand-up comedy, abstracted spoken word, and goofy (but highly effective) dancing into a hilarious and fascinating whole. Fae work has been described as the middle of a “Bermuda Triangle” that includes three artistic forebears: Nicki Minaj, the video artist Ryan Trecartin, and the poet Ariana Reines. Meaning, the work they make is colorful, fueled by amphetamines and raunchy, but highly theoretical, and very interested in the body and identity. Defy a Thing to Be is a short, acerbic, and often very funny album that only spans 22 minutes over 9 tracks. It lives in this intersection of experimental dance music and hip hop, one that recalls the work of artists like Yves Tumor, Nguzunguzu (and the Night Slugs\\/Fade to Mind crew at large), Lotic, and queer rappers like Le1f. Although, unlike any of these artists, Fae’s work is much more invested—often to its own detriment—in heady and restricted kinds of experimentation. The lyrics attempt to explore a broad and almost overwhelming number of subjects. The writing can be very serious and probing: “Hack up the program hosting us\\/Addicted to systems...\\/You could say I’m addicted\\/But how do we define addiction,” but also grotesquely humorous: “Bossy but a bottom at best I wish.” On the level of Fae’s writing alone, there is a sly and investigative quality that can’t be imitated. Yet, their voice will definitely be polarizing for many listeners. It can be piercing or cartoonish, and it is often garbled by digital effects, but there is no avoiding the fact that a needling voice can be a bad messenger for such dense thinking. Even if unintended, Fae’s sometimes erratic flow can make the expression of their ideas clunky and forced. Often, the album’s saving grace is clever, subtle, and fluid production across the nine tracks. Fae’s beats are often vaporous, foreboding, and almost dystopian, cloaking their voice with a razor’s edge that makes up for any vocal shortcomings. Take for example songs like “Elevator Pitch (lasséz-fairy forecast),” where Fae attempts to critically frame this corporate experience with a queer sensibility. Lines like, “Picture us online\\/All accounts entwined” or “Like a verb man can I heard your a word man” don’t sound disjointed or so random, because Fae is able to create a sonic space that is dimly lit and uncomfortable and unpredictable. In the music video for the song, it becomes profoundly weird, which depicts Fae cavorting around an empty office in a shabby suit. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of Defy a Thing to Be is that it just seems better suited for the stage or for visual consumption. Part of Fae’s theory of performance is based upon a kind of focused randomness that can be lost with the album form. Watching videos of Fae perform show that their ideas simultaneously focus and loosen in the context of actual performance. The critical aspect of Fae’s work seems to go missing when experienced only in your headphones. Similar to the artist working in the NON collective, Fae works to implicate an audience, but it requires a dance floor and willing group to generate this ideal experience. Fae almost proves Peggy Phelan's idea that performance can only exist in the present, and that documentation and records of it are profoundly different. As an act of artistic subversion, Defy a Thing to Be hits the mark with its level of thinking, but misses a key element of physicality that would make it something special. \"],[22595,\"On their new full-length L.A. Heartbreak, the electro-punk duo Rainbow Arabia (married couple Tiffany and Danny Preston) has evolved into a full-fledged mainstream pop act. The tropical polyrhythms of their earliest works are sublimated into post-Moroder synth vamps, and  a newfound sense of balance and a lighter touch have clicked into compositions of unexpected sophistication. In one sense, this is a logical progression from their 2008 debut EP Basta through 2013’s FM Sushi, as the brightly colored and self-consciously “exotic” influences of North African and “other” pop musics have gradually becomes subtler and more balanced. But even in the album’s most satisfying moments, it’s impossible not to feel that there is something missing.To pin down exactly what that missing element is, it’s necessary to untwine—or maybe re-entangle—the polar elements of Rainbow Arabia’s sound; big percussion grooves and brassy microtonal synths on the one hand (think Sublime Frequencies) and wistful, distant vocals and subtler arrangements on the other (think Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, New Order) on the other. These two ideas are not so different:  Even at their most exploratory, Rainbow Arabia have always been heirs of a sort to new wave and ’80s synthpop. Their aesthetic could be described as Berlin or Missing Persons for a generation that has swapped out MTV for YouTube vids of Vybz Kartel and kuduro.On L.A. Heartbreak, one gets the sense that Preston & Preston are less likely to spend their time daydreaming with a store-bought fluorescent light and more likely to address their issues like grown-ups. The trippy and exotic elements are still there—just toned down and incorporated into something that feels more like everyday life. “Followed” comes on like “Just Can’t Get Enough”-era Depeche Mode before shifting into more soaring sadness. “Top Hat” takes three of it’s four minutes to morph into a slow acid house track worthy of Mr. Fingers. But the various elements feel most cohesive on the lead single “Plena.” A slow reggaeton pulse is augmented by scintillating synth-work that suggests sunlight sparkling off water, as Tiffany intones “Take me on a holiday...I am so in love with you\\/Tell me what you wanna do” in a voice so plaintive it’s easy to read as “I am so alone with you.” A new listener might rightly wonder if this was the new Gwen Stefani song or maybe another EDM-pop prodigy a la the Chainsmokers (if that sounds backhanded, it’s not—pop this effortless is rare and never as easy to make as it is to listen to).Over the LP as a whole, though, this more anonymous, disaffected sound leaves the topography of Rainbow Arabia a bit flat, sometimes (as on “Modern Contemporary” and “Mixolydian”) feeling like Afrobeat without any of the urgency or joy. The duo’s songwriting has grown stronger, and their arrangements more subtle. Even the record's honest disaffection feels in some ways more authentic than their erstwhile experiments in “world” sounds. But those forays, even when they were clunky or unfortunate, also brought a sense of play and provocation that is missing here. Now that they’ve landed back on Earth, maybe next time they can bring some of their wilder, more colorful dreams back with them.\"],[22467,\"Kate Bush always exploited technological advancement. In 1979, from just coathangers and Blu-Tack, the trailblazing British pop auteur pioneered the head mic for her vanguard Tour of Life. Her subsequent albums made her one of the earliest adopters of the Fairlight synthesizer that would define the ’80s. Before the Dawn, then, is a surprising throwback: the unexpurgated live album, a document of her 2014 live shows, her first in 35 years. There are no retakes or overdubs bar a few atmospheric FX. No apps, no virtual reality, no interactivity. She’s also said there won’t be a DVD, which is surprising given the show’s spectacular theatrics, conceived by the former artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and a host of designers, puppeteers, and illusionists. The show, and this release, aren’t credited to Kate Bush but the KT Fellowship, in recognition of the vast ensemble effort. Yet in shucking off half the production, this hefty 155-minute, three-disc set (one per “act”) is also the best way that Before the Dawn could have been preserved, allowing it to tell its own story uninhibited by the busy staging.I went to a show towards the end of the 22-date run, and was overwhelmed by how physically moving it was to see Bush in real life, since for most of mine she’s only existed in videos and BBC clip-show documentaries. The staging didn’t always have the same impact. The sublime Act One, as close to a greatest hits as we got, was stripped back—just Bush at the piano backed by her crack band.In Act Two, Bush realized her long-held desire to dramatize “The Ninth Wave,” the conceptual B-side of 1985’s Hounds of Love, which documents a woman’s dark night of the soul as she fights for life while lost at sea. While her “husband” and real-life son Bertie McIntosh blithely carried on with domestic life inside a tiny, sloping living room set, a video depicted Bush stranded in dark, choppy waters (now released as the “And Dream of Sheep” video). Moments later, the real Bush reappeared on stage to fight sinister “fish people” who carried her body off through the aisles. The whirring blades and desperate search lights of a rescue helicopter descended from the Hammersmith Apollo’s ceiling, illuminating and buffeting the crowd. Despite some hammy dialogue, it was staggering, and in sharp contrast to Act Three, which focused on Aerial’s second side, “A Sky of Honey.” McIntosh played a landscape painter from ye olden times while a life-size marionette of a jointed-doll simpered around the stage, embracing Bush, who looked on in raptures. At 75 minutes long, it was a sickly, trying accompaniment to one of the subtler achievements in her catalogue.With the visuals stripped away, some confusing vestiges of the live show remain on the record—mostly the stilted dialogue (McIntosh’s lines as the painter are cringeworthy). But otherwise it flows remarkably well: the prog grooves and piano ballads of the first act setting up the gothic tumult of “The Ninth Wave,” which comes down into the sun-dappled ambience of “A Sky of Honey.” The sound is rich and warm, but rough, too: imperfectly mic’d and properly live-sounding. The arrangements are largely faithful, even down to the synth presets, though sometimes the veteran session musicians form an overwhelming battalion. “Lily” comes out sounding a bit like Christian goth rock, and “King of the Mountain” is a victim of breadth over depth, its dynamics drowned out by every band member playing at once. It’s a shame that the terror of “Hounds of Love” gets swapped for sentimental optimism, but the band recreate that album’s second half to sound as avant-garde and bracing as any current young outsider.Live albums are meant to capture performers at their rawest and least inhibited, which doesn’t really apply to Before the Dawn. Bush is a noted perfectionist best known for her synthesizer experiments and love of obscure Bulgarian choirs, but her recent work has skewed towards traditional setups that reunite her with the prog community that fostered her early career. With marks to hit and tableaux to paint, the 2014 shows were more War of the Worlds (or an extension of 2011’s Director’s Cut) than Live at Leeds. But never mind balls-out revamps of Bush’s best known songs; with the exception of tracks from Hounds of Love, none of the rest of the setlist had ever been done live—not even on TV, which became Bush’s primary stage after she initially retired from touring. These songs weren’t written to be performed, but internalized. Occupying Bush’s imagination for an hour, and letting it fuse with your own, formed the entirety of the experience. Hearing this aspic-preserved material come to life feels like going to sleep and waking up decades later to see how the world has changed.“Jig of Life” is the midpoint of Before the Dawn, and its crux. It forms the part in “The Ninth Wave” where Bush’s character is exhausted of fighting against drowning, and decides to succumb to death. A vision of her future self appears, and convinces her to stay alive. “Now is the place where the crossroads meet,” she chants, just as her (then) 56-year-old voice channels her 27-year-old one. Despite her alleged taste for burning one, Bush’s voice has gained in power rather than faded with age. It’s deeper now, and some of the songs’ keys shift to match, but it’s alive and incalculably moving, still capable of agile whoops and tender eroticism, and possesses a newfound authority. When she roars lustily through opener “Lily” and its declaration that “life has blown a great big hole through me,” she sets up the stakes of Before the Dawn’s quest for peace. In Act One, she’s running from the prospect of love on “Hounds of Love” and “Never Be Mine,” and from fame on “King of the Mountain,” where she searches for Elvis with sensual anticipation. She asks for Joan of Arc’s protection on “Joanni,” matching the French visionary’s fearlessness with her own funky diva roar, and sounds as if she could raze the world as she looks down from “Top of the City.”Rather than deliver a copper-bottomed greatest hits set, Bush reckons with her legacy through what might initially seem like an obscure choice of material. Both Acts Two and Three take place in transcendent thresholds: “The Ninth Wave”’s drowning woman is beset by anxiety and untold pressures, with no idea of where to turn, mirroring the limbo that Bush experienced after 1982’s The Dreaming. That suite’s last song, the cheery “The Morning Fog,” transitions into Aerial’s “Prelude,” all beatific bird call and dawn-light piano. The euphoric, tender “A Sky of Honey” is meant to represent a perfect day from start to finish, filled with family and beautiful imperfections. “Somewhere in Between” finds them atop “the highest hill,” looking out onto a stilling view, and Bush’s eerie jazz ensemble anticipates the liminal peace of Bowie’s Blackstar. “Not one of us would dare to break the silence,” she sings. “Oh how we have longed for something that would make us feel so… somewhere in between.”Purgatory has become heaven, and in the narrative Bush constructs through her setlist, “A Sky of Honey” represents the grown-up, domestic happiness that staves off the youthful fears explored on Hounds of Love. For her final song, she closes with a rendition of “Cloudbusting,” a song about living with the memory of a forbidden love, which is even more glorious for all the hope that it’s accumulated in the past 30-odd years. Bush’s recent life as a “reclusive” mother is often used to undermine her, to “prove” she was the kook that sexist critics had pegged her as all along. These performances and this record are a generous reveal of why she’s chosen to retreat, where Bush shows she won’t disturb her hard-won peace to sustain the myth of the troubled artistic genius. Between the dangerous waters of “The Ninth Wave” and the celestial heavens of “A Sky of Honey,” Before the Dawn demystifies what we’ve fetishized in her absence. Without draining her magic, it lets Bush exist back down on Earth.\"],[22613,\"E-40 only released one project in 2015—unusual by the prolific rapper's standards. After dropping nothing but double and triple albums on an annual basis since 2010, a 7-song EP felt might’ve felt scant in comparison to the tomes to which we had grown accustomed to receiving; instead, the succinctness of Poverty and Prosperity felt like fresh air rushing into a cellar that hadn’t been opened in decades. But a fundamental shift in the Bay Area legend’s approach to disseminating his music the EP was not. With The D-Boy Diary: Books 1 and 2, E-40 returns to the firehose method that over the past six years has become his default mode. Except this time around there’s an increasing sense that he’s beginning to repeat himself.The most obvious example: “Uh Huh” is a shameless retread of E-40’s own “Choices (Yup),” the now gold-certified track from 2014’s Sharp on All 4 Corners. It uses the same call-and-response format, except it swaps out “Yup” and “Nope” for the nearly synonymous “Uh huh” and “Mm mm.” Even its beat is a simulacrum of its predecessor’s eerie slink, only less eerie and less slinky. Of course, being as inventive a rapper as he is, E-40 still manages to cram “Uh Huh” with novel swaths of wordplay: “Your paper shorter than a fake smile (Mm mm!)\\/My paper longer than a murder trial (Uh huh!).” It’s not the only instance of déjà vu—many of the double album’s 44 tracks feature production that recalls earlier E-40 material in broad strokes if not exact configurations: squelchy synths, block-shaped percussion, and an endless buoyancy.Which isn’t to say that any of these beats are bad; there’s nary a dud in the entire batch, but they do feel slightly less imaginative than they have in the past. The sheer amount of music on most E-40 projects can amplify this issue—when the beats are as homogeneous as they are here, even the slightest dip in quality will produce uneventful stretches. For every “Hunedz,” whose hydraulic bounce comes courtesy of hyphy pioneer Rick Rock, there’s a “Bag on Me,” which hits all the required marks but not particularly enthusiastically, or boilerplate hyphy like “The Grit Don’t Quit.” All of E-40’s usual in-house collaborators are here: from his son Droop-E—whose three contributions are all highlights, the inside-out lurch of “Goon Music” standing tallest—to fellow Californian DecadeZ, all the producers enlisted deliver beats that range from guaranteed function-starters to merely functional.As with most of the E-40’s gargantuan projects, the moments that fall furthest from the mean stylistically tend to be found towards the tail-end of each volume. Book 1’s “Check” is a collaboration with Zaytoven, and the Atlanta producer known best for his work with the likes of Gucci Mane and Future serves up one of his iciest tracks in recent memory, full of slow-rolling menace and verging-on-EDM wubs. “2 Seater,” from Book 2, is the most conspicuously anomalous beat on the whole project. Nard N B bring a pop sensibility to the Kid Ink-featuring love song, and E-40 brags about how for a special night out with his girl he “booked this room on Hotels.com.” The track’s low-friction glide sets it apart from the rest of the album’s bottom-heavy focus, but it suits E-40, a rapper who has always had a strong ear for beats.It helps that even though the production sometimes leans run-of-the-mill, E-40 remains as enamored as ever with the physical act of rapping. Nowhere does he sound more energized than on “I Had It in a Drought,” a joyous back-in-the-day reminiscence that naturally doubles as a brag session. The main character of the song, however, is not E-40 himself but rather the Bay Area itself: “On Solano Avenue, I bought a clothing store\\/In Vallejo, California: entrepreneur\\/Next to Davenport, Elite Check Cashing store\\/Across the street from Church's Chicken, it was on\\/A couple of doors down, Studio Ton.” His lyrics are so hyper-specific that you can find the actual street view using Google Maps. And on an album where his rubber-ball cadence belies his age (49!), it’s no surprise that he sounds most youthful rapping about his second favorite topic (after E-40): his hometown.Straight thoughts delivered with zig-zagging technique: this has always been E-40’s formula. It sounds simple; in reality, it’s anything but. His rapping style—all over the beat without being bucked off, simultaneously pushing and pulling in all directions—is one that few if any try to approximate at all, let alone lift wholesale. It’s so inextricably linked with him that it would sound alien coming from anyone else. And the rub is he makes it sound as natural as breathing. “I’m a master of reality\\/Rap about good times and casualties” he raps on “Blessed By the Game.” There’s always been an underlying current of civic duty in his music, an unquenchable need to document the events around him for the benefit of future generations—and this one, too. The D-Boy Diary is just further proof that as long as he’s alive, E-40 won’t stop.\"],[22620,\"Over her half-century career as a composer and singer, Meredith Monk has refreshed the language of vocal music. She has cultivated steely modes of expression in her top register, and gravely dramatic timbres in the low end. In between those extremes, she possesses a library of stunning, diverse effects that come across as intensely physical. On a recording, Monk’s voice doesn’t enter the listener’s consciousness from some disembodied ether. The music sails directly from the discrete figure at its center.The pressed-lip vibrations, throat clicks and beaming yowls of childhood play are celebrated in her singing. And these tricks are also put to use for emotionally varied ends. A tender lullaby might veer into a cathartic silliness. A pulse-driven group chant can collapse into solemn observance. Patterns are present, though mostly for the purpose of being challenged by an unlikely development.Occasionally she uses short English phrases to anchor a theme. More often, the vocal production is wordless—though it is no less communicative for that fact. The influence of this style is felt both inside and outside the academy. When listening to Björk, Joanna Newsom, or Kate Soper, you’re dealing with a tradition that stretches back through Monk, who has studied classical and folk forms and found luminous ways to channel them. On Behalf of Nature is titled after one of Monk’s recent, wordless stage shows: a meditation on ecological themes, including climate change. Despite that impassioned editorial focus, her resulting suite of songs and motifs avoids coming across like a lecture. And because she always revises the music from a dramatic piece before creating an album, Nature sounds purposeful and complete throughout its hourlong running time. Aside from her vocal troupe, the instrumental forces include ace percussionist John Hollenbeck, harpist Laura Sherman, and the reed-instrument player Bohdan Hilash. (One current singer in Monk’s group, Allison Sniffin, also doubles on piano, violin and French horn.)With a spare introductory theme voiced on a Burmese piccolo, opening track “Dark\\/Light 1” evokes a pre-dawn zone of austere beauty. Later, a brooding bass clarinet is stalked calmly by a vibraphone tones. Then Monk’s voice enters, creating a sense of shamanistic ritual. Her notes could be talismans against danger, or the first melody after a cataclysmic event. Gradually, her sound gives way to that of a male voice, for a short stretch, before the the full vocal ensemble enters with gleaming new harmonies. In moving from a vulnerable, solo state to a zone of greater security and community, the music etches its broad narrative.Throughout Nature, the composer’s graceful use of diverse sonic phenomena amounts to a plea for biodiversity. This argument works via metaphor, instead of through the language of the stump speech. Rich rounds of vocal writing suggest organic growth processes, on “Fractal Activity.” The murmurs of “Environs 1” sound like the byproduct of a busy hive. Then there are the serene glances at beauty, as in the clarinet, vibraphone and French horn feature “Eon.” And you can understand why Monk rejects the “minimalist” label during a movement like “Duet with Shifting Ground”—where blocks of seemingly stable harmony are interrupted by prickly parts for violin and percussion.Surprises keep coming, without ruining the charming underlying vibe. Strange string lines sneak up on the vocalists, during the otherwise imperturbable “Evolution.” Unexpected rhythmic stresses make “Pavement Steps” into an unlikely dance number. Occasionally, Monk’s hooks seem to be present merely so that they can be upended. But thanks to the palindrome-like “arch form” of the piece, all these feints and stylistic burrows eventually feel unified, when early motifs reappear in slightly adapted form, toward the close of the piece. At 74, Monk’s voice doesn’t have quite the otherworldly pliability captured on vintage recordings like Do You Be. Yet she is utterly commanding during this album’s centerpiece, “Water\\/Sky Rant.” Here, Monk inhabits the role of a woman petitioning the heavens for a downpour. Harp arpeggios support the initial entreaties; an optimistic clarinet tries to help make the sale. Then, a shift in the harmony shows us that the sky is still parched. Monk’s voice momentarily sounds defeated, tinny. Then she unleashes a show-stopping “rant,” full of the desperate, throaty extended-techniques that this singer has been pioneering ever since Julius Eastman was a member of her vocal ensemble. Of late, Monk has started receiving more invitations to write for orchestras and string quartets. In her liner notes to Nature, it is acknowledged that “the voices and instruments have equal weight” this time—a state of play that might startle those who think of her talent in narrower terms. Still, she’s always been more than one of the world’s great singers. Some of Monk’s best pieces, like the 1991 opera Atlas, have also boasted dazzling instrumental writing. Her vocal instrument remains the envy of singers fifty years her junior. But on Nature, the uniqueness of her compositional vision is just as impressive.\"],[22633,\"The last track on Pavo Pavo's debut album, Young Narrator in the Breakers, is called “2020, We'll Have Nothing Going On,” which seems strikingly ominous now given the state of current American politics. However, the Brooklyn-based five-piece consider themselves optimists—a fact mirrored in their music and their aesthetic. The album's artwork features two women holding hands, walking into a metallic horizon like a 1950s advertisement, and this type of imagery informs the album. Young Narrator in the Breakers sounds like a ’70s soft-rock dispatch from what people in the mid-20th century thought the future would be like: jetpacks, Mars landings, and dehydrated Thanksgiving dinners. Their music embraces space-age retro-futurism, but with some gentle touches from the last 10 years of indie rock (Fleet Foxes' angelic harmonies; Grizzly Bear's urban folk; Arcade Fire's wide-eyed chamber pop) to keep them from being stuck in nostalgic pastiche. All five members of Pavo Pavo are classically trained musicians as well as songwriters—and instead of seeming like disparate entities all vying for your attention, each person contributes just enough in their respective area that every drum fill, handclap and keyboard stab falls perfectly into place. “Time is a hole in my waterbed,” sings vocalist\\/keyboardist Eliza Bagg in her soothing soprano on the album opener “Ran Ran Run,” exactly the sort of softly loopy line that gives Pavo Pavo their off-beat color. As the chorus kicks in, the song shifts gears from downtempo to upbeat, jaunty pop, illustrating the band's knack for unconventional arrangements, another factor that keeps their somewhat typical setup from falling into conventionality. It seems that 2016 had brought on a miniature, unexpected ’70s soft-rock revival (think the Lemon Twigs' mellow glam or Drugdealer's woozy folk). Down to their soft focus press photos in color-coordinated turtlenecks, this is a style Pavo Pavo make no qualms about embracing, and “Wiserway,” another highlight, is the closest they get to realizing it. Supported by off-kilter synthesizers that plod along like the theme to a forgotten after-school special, vocalist\\/guitarist Oliver Hill's voice, somewhere between a confession and plea, coasts effortlessly across his bandmates' three-part harmonies. Pavo Pavo may have formed in Brooklyn, but everything about this song conjures up images of Laurel Canyon, midnight beach bonfires and lazy coastal car rides.  The album is not without the occasional misstep: The title track interlude is a one-minute-long burst of space rock that aches to be given a full song treatment. But more often than not, Pavo Pavo redress those imperfections within a matter of seconds—“No Mind,” an uptempo number that at times sounds like Mark Mothersbaugh fronting the Flaming Lips, glues the second half of the album together, and “John (a Little Time)” makes the best use of Bagg's haunting vocals in a whisper of a ballad, like a lovelorn alien reaching out from the farthest reaches of the galaxy. By the time you do finally reach the closing sigh of “2020, We'll Have Nothing Going On,” the song's driving, mid-era Beach Boys wish to “Take me to the country\\/Seriously, Christine” does begin to feel like a promise of a better tomorrow, building a rocket to the future with childlike wonder. Whatever the actual year 2020 will hold, for now, Pavo Pavo's escapism feels cozy, uplifting, and wholly appropriate. \"],[22597,\"In the constellation of small clubs, one-off dancefloors, disused industrial structures, abandoned basements, strange apartments, and wonderfully forlorn spaces that compose and incubate the New York dance scene in the last half-decade, Dylan Scheer, who DJs and produces as Via App, has emerged as one of the city’s most prodigious talents. If you’ve seen her behind the ones and twos at, say, Bossa Nova Civic Club in Brooklyn or Trans-Pecos in Queens, you’ll notice immediately that she prefers caustic and uncomfortable music, and her style is defined by a jitter and mercurial mixing that delightfully defies the streamlined logic of by-the-book techno. It’s the kind of DJing that befits the protean and defiant nature of New York’s dance scene. On her third studio album, Sixth Stitch, Scheer presents an ominous and decidedly gothic vision of club music.Sixth Stitch is composed of 16 tracks, divided between a series of short interstitial instrumental sketches and more “traditional” dance songs. On her past releases, Scheer made tunes that existed outside of genre, tracks that could be playful and angry, filled with crunching noises and slippery bass lines. Her production was as unexpected as it was seemingly unfocused. Now, she shows a tighter vision, a sharpened sense of what she wants her music to do. Across the music on Sixth Stitch, she creates a creeping tactile sensation that generates a sordid sense of time and place. It is music that imagines the parts of a club that reside behind closed doors and shadowy corners.In the album’s opening track “Far She,” Scheer lays out the newfound physicality of her music. The piece is haunted by a churning drone that sounds like a malfunctioning white noise machine or a broken appliance. After the noise has become somewhat hypnotizing, Scheer inverts the mood and introduces a percussive element that mimics the sound and feeling of someone banging on a closed door. Seconds later, there is more banging, as if a crowd is forming outside your bedroom. If you’re listening to this on headphones, alone in your apartment, her mix of sounds generates a distinct feeling of horror.It’s not as if her music is totally predicated on discomfort, but she deploys a series of anxious and claustrophobic moments to make this album’s joyful moments even more pronounced and triumphant. In tracks like “Get in Line” she uses a gurgling collection of noise that’s drippy, wet, and muffled. When percussion starts to stabilize and she adds in a loop of sharp synths, it’s a pure relief, as if you’ve climbed out of a manhole to see the rest of the world. After minutes of nervousness tracks can become downright goofy, and the release of energy is potent.Elsewhere, Scheer experiments with more cinematic sounds that seem to borrow from Flying Lotus or John Carpenter. In “Viasabel,” she loops a glittering array of keyboard flicks into something that could easily soundtrack a scene in a galactic cantina on a backwater planet. “Con Artist” presents a back-breaking version of jungle that would  be appropriate for the rave scene in the second Matrix movie. As daring as Scheer’s selection of sounds are, the sheer length of the album leads to long sections that seem shapeless or mired by wasted space. In songs like “Phantom Dictation,” about two minutes are spent playing around with all the different ways you could pass a simple drumline through a helium filter, and the momentum disappears.Still, Sixth Stitch is a bit of a daredevil feat for this young producer. Few have her ability to turn bedlam into such an organized and effective music. Scheer has said in the past that she looks to DJs like Ashland Mines (aka Total Freedom) as aesthetic forebears. Arca once said that Mines was the “king of painting through chaos.” Scheer seems to be angling for a title of her own. \"],[22561,\"Ice Cube left N.W.A. in late 1989 over a royalty dispute, a fairly mundane conclusion to his tenure as the intellectual force and chief lyricist for the self-proclaimed “World’s Most Dangerous Group” after only one proper album. Cube’s lyrics for “Fuck the Police” had triggered an F.B.I. response earlier that same year, but Cube was still living at home with his parents when Straight Outta Compton was rocketing toward platinum status. He was 20 years old, and he’d just turned down a $75,000 check because he didn’t trust Eazy-E and Jerry Heller, who ran the group’s label, Ruthless Records. Two years later, with the release of Death Certificate, he’d be the biggest and most controversial rapper in the world.  During the two years between Cube’s split in late 1989 and the release of Death Certificate, his sprawling, imperfect magnum opus in late 1991, rap music grew up in a hurry, experiencing its pop and punk moments simultaneously. Crossover acts like L.L. Cool J, M.C. Hammer, Vanilla Ice, Kid ‘N Play, DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, and Digital Underground took rap to the top of the charts and into the heart of suburban multiplexes, while southern California gangsta rap continued to proliferate in N.W.A.’s wake via Above the Law, Compton’s Most Wanted and Cypress Hill. On the East Coast, Public Enemy’s Black Nationalist oratory and incisive media critiques, which inspired Straight Outta Compton, continued on 1990’s Fear of a Black Planet. The Geto Boys took their nightmarish vision of Houston’s Fifth Ward to the Hot 100 singles chart while Miami’s 2 Live Crew emerged as unlikely First Amendment pioneers, and regional rap scenes took shape around the country.As rap continued to evolve and mutate during this two-year period, forces both internal and external worked to validate it as a cultural and economic power. By 1991, the quickly industrializing genre had spawned its own house organ, as The Source—the first magazine to cover rap in its fans’ vernacular, and a central node linking the disparate nationwide phenomenon together—was bringing in seven-figure ad revenues after moving to New York City from Boston in 1990. In March 1991, rap was legitimized in a different(and perhaps more significant) way: Billboard unveiled a radical (and long-overdue) change to its chart methodology. Instead of relying on self-reported sales numbers from retailers—which ignored many independent and “urban” outlets—the new SoundScan system used actual bar code data to determine sales. The impact for rap was felt immediately: N.W.A.’s independently-distributed Efil4zaggin debuted at #2 on the Billboard Top 200 chart behind Paula Abdul’s Spellbound, before climbing to the top spot in its second week. Six months later, Death Certificate, on which Priority spent $18,000 in marketing and which enjoyed no Top 40 airplay, outsold Hammer’s fourth album Too Legit to Quit (which Capitol spent a million dollars promoting) in both LPs’ first weeks in stores. Gangsta rap had won. Death Certificate is not Cube’s best album. May 1990’s Amerikkka’s Most Wanted is tighter, and the peaks of 1992’s The Predator, released after the Rodney King verdict-inspired L.A. rebellion, are higher. But Death Certificate is Ice Cube’s most important album, and one of the most essential works in rap history. Released a few months after Cube’s star turn as the dead-eyed Doughboy in the summer 1991 release Boyz in the Hood, and preceded by the irresistible first single “Steady Mobbin,” Death Certificate was anticipated like few rap albums had ever been. It had been six months since the King tape showed the LAPD gang-assaulting a black motorist, and their trial wouldn’t start for another six. A million copies of Death Certificate were shipped, and it was certified platinum two months after it hit stores. In the shadow of the King video, and with tensions higher than ever between south LA’s black citizens and the police, expectations were high for Cube, who at the time co-owned rap’s creative and political mantle with Chuck D. With Death Certificate, Cube met them head on.  In a nod toward the vinyl format that was rapidly obsolescing in 1991, Cube split the album into the “Death Side” (“a mirror image of where we are today”) and the “Life Side” (“a vision of where we need to go”). Other rap albums had toyed with the “concept” idea—De La Soul’s 1989 LP 3 Feet High and Rising was a big influence on Cube for AMW, skits and all. Yet due to its status, Death Certificate established a permanent lane for conceptual works in rap music, which Nas and the Notorious B.I.G. would capitalize on with their own death-fixated concept albums a few years later.Death Certificate’s sides serve as an organizing mechanism for Cube’s two primary subject areas. The “Death Side” is Cube as crass hood storyteller, relating oft-hilarious tales about the VD clinic, stopping at your mom’s house to take a shit, haranguing a girl’s dad about her most intimate activities, even a trip to St. Louis that wound up in a jail stay. “Look Who’s Burnin’” and “Steady Mobbin’” show Cube’s unparalleled skill at lighthearted, detail-rich, slice-of-South Central-life songs—they predict not only the melancholic “It Was a Good Day,” but 1995 film Friday, Cube’s loving, hilarious ode to a single day in his neighborhood. And yes, some of these songs are stomach-churning—“Givin’ Up the Nappy Dugout” wavers between slut-shaming and sexual assault—but the “Death Side” concept is designed to allow Cube a performative “out.” This isn’t autobiography, it argues, but a reflection of the worst impulses of his community (personal mileage, as always, may vary).The “Life Side,” conversely, is Cube as op-ed columnist, a racially isolationist embodiment of the album’s cover image of Cube standing next to a corpse tagged as “Uncle Sam,” with all the metaphorical subtlety of a political cartoonist. Interracial dating, moving to the suburbs, selling drugs, gangbanging: all of these are noxious activities that are preventing the black race (okay, black men) from reaching its potential. This side, significantly more controversial than the first, was an outgrowth of Cube’s fortuitous 1990 run-in with Chuck D. in the Def Jam lobby. After splitting with N.W.A. and learning that Ruthless wouldn’t let Dre produce his first solo album, Cube headed east, to track down 3rd Bass’ producer. After running into D., Cube took a feature slot on Public Enemy’s 1990 single “Burn Hollywood Burn,” and an east\\/west creative partnership was established.D. and the Bomb Squad would exert a huge influence on Amerikkka’s Most Wanted. “Public Enemy taught me how to put a record together as far as knowing what song should come after what song and the feel of a record,” Cube later recalled. “Chuck D is a master at that. How it’s sequenced as a whole is just as important as each individual record.” AMW was a huge step forward for West Coast rap, with Cube further shaping the “nigga” and “gangsta” archetypes he’d started with N.W.A. while creating something close to a full conceptual work complete with skits, samples from the actual America’s Most Wanted television show, and an overall consistency that the shallow-past-the-singles Straight Outta Compton lacked.Cube’s other P.E.-inspired transformation was happening at the content level, as he turned N.W.A.’s shock-rap into a new hybrid form: part gangsta nihilism and part post-Black Power militarism, inspired by P.E.’s deep connections with the Nation of Islam and its controversial figurehead Louis Farrakhan. The differences between P.E. and Cube are instructive: if “Fight the Power” pioneered a form of post-Black Power cultural politics informed by a desire for a cultural movement, then AMW proper opener “The Nigga You Love To Hate” (and its sequel, Death Certificate opener ‘The Wrong Nigga to Fuck With”) is driven by Cube’s sui generis self-interest. Where Chuck D. was an outspoken diplomat, Cube was a righteous mercenary in the KRS-One mold, aiming as much at suburban pieties—hey kids, check out “Gangsta’s Fairytale”!—as his perceived enemies. After eight years under Ronald Reagan’s oppressive social and economic policies, which were particularly devastating to black communities, it made sense for a politicized South Central rapper to shun the idea of community mobilization and carve out a cultural politics of the self. The already privileged succeeded wildly, while historically marginalized populations like those in Compton and South Central L.A. deteriorated. Reagan’s Draconian “war on drugs” devastated inner cities for generations. First Lady Nancy urged kids to “Just Say No,” placing the onus to wipe out the crack epidemic not on the state but the individual. This same bootstraps ideal did away with civil rights organizing in exchange for self-entrepreneurship in a putatively free market, and it was from this landscape that Cube’s new identity was born. Jeff Chang explained it best in Cant Stop, Won’t Stop: “If Nation of Millions had signaled the end of the civil rights era, Death Certificate’s primary impulse was to dance on the grave.” On Death Certificate, Cube expanded AMW’s lone-gunman individualism into a fierce, convoluted political manifesto. It’s not just about Cube alone anymore, but the future of young black men. “Niggaz are in a state of emergency” are the first seven words on the album. “I want to see my brothers and sisters on a higher economical level and treating themselves with more respect,” Cube told the L.A. Times in 1991. “The American Dream is not for Blacks. Blacks who (still believe in that dream) are kidding themselves…What I try to do is tell the kids the truth…the brutal, harsh truth—pulling no punches—about what's out there in the world.” Cube’s truth-telling was rooted in his recently forged relationship to the Nation of Islam, a movement that had recenty brought back to prominence by the outspoken Farrakhan. The NOI had done much good for Black communities over time by preaching a gospel of self-reliance and racial separatism. Both notions permeate Death Certificate’s politics, and, it should be noted, experienced their renaissance during that same individualistic, increasingly identity-factionalized 1980s.  On the album’s CD tray image, Cube is pictured reading the NOI newspaper The Final Call, while strategically positioned between his recently assembled Lench Mob crew on the left and Nation representatives standing at attention on the right. It’s tough to know how much Cube’s NOI affiliation was rooted in ideological purity or performative opportunism—on “Steady Mobbin’”, he wonders if the better come-up is to “start sellin’ bean pies” or bootleg “You Can’t Touch This” t-shirts—though he’d obviously taken Farrakhan’s recommendation to use his fame to spread the word. In 1991, the devout Muslim and Watts-bred rapper Kam and Nation spokesperson Khalid Abdul Muhammad shaved off Cube’s “toxic” Jheri curl, and both appear on the album.  It’s easy to draw a direct line between NOI teachings (including a discredited, Cube-endorsed book that alleges Jewish people dominated the trans-Atlantic slave trade) and Cube’s anti-Semitic remarks on “No Vaseline,” Cube’s response to N.W.A.’s diss-track diptych “Message to B.A.” and “Real Niggaz” (the latter of which was repurposed from the 100 Miles and Runnin’ EP). “No Vaseline” doesn’t fit with the rest of Death Certificate at all—it’s like Cube left the stage and confronted N.W.A. in an alley behind the venue, bringing his mic. Although the violence was symbolic, “No Vaseline” remains a hateful song, Cube using homophobia and anti-Semitism as crude weaponry for his macho language battle. The track led the Simon Wiesenthal Center to call for a nationwide boycott of Death Certificate because Cube recommends dispensing with the “devil” Heller by putting “a bullet in his temple.” Island Records, which distributed the album in Europe, removed “Vaseline” (and “Black Korea”) from copies there. In his review of “Death Certificate,” the Village Voice’s Robert Christgau called Cube a “sex bigot” and compared “Vaseline” to Axl Rose’s xenophobic lyrics on “One in a Million.”The “Vaseline” controversy fed headlines for months, and for Cube’s millions of fans, its real-life soap-opera thrill only fed into the song’s problematic appeal. Like with so much art that is virtuosic and problematic in equal measure, many took perverse joy listening to Cube eradicate precarious communicative boundaries that help maintain civil discourse. Especially for the teenage boys who comprised Cube’s core audience at the time, “No Vaseline” was its own rap Wrestlemania headline bout: a triumphal act of face-saving in an easy-to-replicate cadence over a sample of Brick’s 1976 disco-funk hit “Dazz.” Cube flipped Ren’s “too much cargo” line from “Real Niggaz” and called him out for driving a B-210, and even turned Eazy-E’s subversive attendance at a Presidential dinner into an act of kowtowing to white authority. Even the song’s title (and theme) was intertextual: It was pulled from LL Cool J’s “To Da Break of Dawn” from the previous year, on which he eviscerates three foes: Kool Moe Dee, MC Hammer, and Ice-T. Cube outdid L there: he took out five enemies in one song.  Until Jay-Z’s 2001 Nas-dismantling “Takeover,” “No Vaseline” was rap’s peak diss track: a non-stop series of consecutively landed, clever punchlines. N.W.A. would break up before getting a chance to respond.“No Vaseline”s flawlessly executed “dozens” routine was one thing. The inflammatory 47-second track “Black Korea,” on which Cube rails against—and obliquely threatens—Korean-American shop owners, was another. The community relationship between Korean-American merchants (who had run liquor stores and convenience shops in black parts of Los Angeles for years) was already tense, but it was inflamed by the 1991 shooting of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins by South Central liquor store owner Soon Ja Du, captured on surveillance video only two weeks after the King footage was released. On “Korea,” Cube alternately suggests a boycott (for which there was precedent) and arson for non-compliant storeowners, characterized as “Oriental, one-penny countin’ motherfuckers” and “chop-suey ass.”The broader context of this issue is best characterized by Chang: Korean-American storeowners were overworked and often terrorized by local gang members; in 1986, Chang notes, the Black-Korean Alliance was formed after four Korean merchants were killed in a single month. Black citizens, on the other hand, were tired of local merchants who wouldn’t hire black workers, who didn’t give back to local communities, and who assumed that any black-skinned person entering their stores had criminal intent.“Black Korea” was not a nuanced song, but Cube wasn’t a politician or a diplomat. He’s “the nigga you love to hate,” and “the wrong nigga to fuck with.” To many critics, however, Death Certificate was merely “the rankest sort of racism and hatemongering,” as Billboard argued in a rare editorial condemning the album. At The Source, editor James Bernard replied to Billboard in a manner befitting his publication’s mindset and audience: the industry magazine was “too dainty and thin-skinned to hear the anger and rage and frustration that many people are forced to deal with every day.” This was the official line from Cube’s camp as well. When Christgau asked for comment, Cube’s publicist Leyla Turkkan framed Death Certificate as “an honest expression of black rage.” Bernard went further (and broader) in a review for Entertainment Weekly: “I’m not arrogant enough to wag my finger at someone for stridency or incorrect language when many of his friends are dead and many of the rest are either in prison or standing on the corner surrounded by burned-out buildings and dying dreams,” he wrote. “These people don’t get to write magazine articles, don’t get elected to political office, and don’t get appointed to the Supreme Court.”As 2Pac would two years later with Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., Cube exploited the mainstream exposure he was receiving as an opportunity to more powerfully broadcast his narrowly intended address. “The truth is I don't care what the white community thinks about the record,” Cube told the LA Times. “I'm talking directly to my Black brothers and sisters. I speak in a language we talk in the streets. Other people can listen too—they might learn something—but I'm talking to the black kids who need somebody to talk sense—honest sense—to them.” This raises a crucial question that we still deal with today: whites bought Death Certificate—an album aimed toward black communities—in the millions. How was a white kid in the Midwest suburbs supposed to assume a subject position as the addressee of a song like “Us,” a song that examines the failures of young black men to take ownership of their own futures, and not rely on government intervention? The answer: we couldn’t. Instead, we eavesdropped.Indeed, one of the most profound cultural shifts occasioned by the rise of gangsta rap, and pioneered by Ice Cube on Death Certificate, is the phenomenon of mass-cultural “listening in.” An album that sells millions of copies is designed to function as a communicative channel from one young black man to an audience of other black men. Chang called Death Certificate “the most impassioned attempt to speak to the young guns of South Central since Bunchy Carter had left the Slausons for the Panthers.” On one hand, of course, this perspective permits Cube a tautological “out”—“I’m not talking to you so you’re not my audience”—that is logically disproven by the fact that he’s releasing the album to a mass audience. On the other hand, understanding the intended audience of a work is absolutely crucial to empathizing with its message.And there were messages: Amid Cube’s fiercest isolationist tendencies, Death Certificate exposes structural failings in a way that no rapper had yet attempted with this degree of clarity. Non-Black listeners may have bought the album for the illicit thrills of “Steady Mobbin’,” “Look Who’s Burnin’” or “No Vaseline,” but those with open ears could learn a lot from “Alive on Arrival.” Dramatically concluding the album’s “Life” side, penultimate track “Arrival” is a grim, detail-rich narrative of a drug-related shooting victim (“looked down, and my sweatshirt’s red at the bottom”) who dies while waiting for treatment at South Central’s MLK Community Hospital after being harassed by the LAPD. Cube’s description of his waiting room horror makes for one of the album’s most richly ironic lines: “One hour done passed\\/Done watched two episodes of M*A*S*H*”. Much of the public attention paid to Death Certificate was devoted to Cube’s lashing out at anyone who stands in his way, but on “Arrival,” he talks about “an overworked physician” who didn’t have the time to give his character more than a band-aid and IV. “Why, oh why, can’t I get help?” Cube pleads as the song concludes. “’Cause I’m Black, I gots to go for self.”Then there’s “A Bird in the Hand,” Cube’s single greatest solo work (with respect to “Who’s the Mack,” “Dead Homiez” and “It Was a Good Day”), and one of the signal moments not only for gangsta rap, but rap history. For just over two minutes, Cube perfectly combines the hardhead, oft-comical street narratives of the Death Side with the fiercely opinionated Life Side tracks. As rhetoric, it’s powerful: the day-to-day life of a young black man in Bush Sr.’s America was pinned in on all sides, with no logical action for economic survival, let alone success, that didn’t involve drug dealing. The trade-offs are expressed with sharp detail—“Always knew that I would clock G’s\\/But ‘Welcome to McDonalds, may I take your order please?”—and pragmatism: “So now you got a pep talk\\/But sorry, this is our only room to walk.”This is saying nothing about the track itself, which is magisterial: Cube’s production crew the Boogiemen (DJ Pooh, Bobcat, and Rashad) interrupt the album’s George Clinton fixation to flip Jimmue Haskell’s paranormal string break from the final third of B.B. King’s 1970 slave-trade opus “Chains and Things” over a razor-sliced drum knock from the first seconds of the Five Stairsteps’ “Don’t Change Your Love.” Kendrick Lamar’s 2012 flip of those drums and Cube’s “fresh outta school” opening line in the MC Eiht-featuring “m.A.A.d City”—a work deeply inspired by Cube’s early ’90s albums—made for a spine-tingling moment of cross-generational gangsta-rap continuity. Lamar himself inducted Cube and the rest of N.W.A. into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2016, largely because of the Cube-penned “Fuck the Police” and “Straight Outta Compton.” That’s just one metric of his reputation, however. To many 2016 teenagers—the age group who loves Lamar and would’ve bought Death Certificate in 1991—N.W.A. is classic rap, canonized in a 2015 biopic, Cube’s solo career is most likely boiled down to “It Was a Good Day,” and he’s more widely known as the star of Friday and the Barbershop movies, if not the angry Captain Dickson in 21 Jump Street. The proto-reality “true-crime” moment of the late 80s and early 90s that spawned Cube’s approach toward rap storytelling has itself morphed into a celebreality TV entertainment juggernaut (see: Kanye, Drake, the Game), while smartphone footage of police killing Black citizens has become a macabre reality of daily online life, mortifying millions but spurring little actual change.Polls show that the country is more racially divided than at any time since the Rodney King verdict, six months after Ice Cube tossed Death Certificate like a Molotov cocktail into the nation’s heated debate about race and rights. In 2016, the death rate for black Americans, according to the CDC, is roughly 50% higher than for whites. Much about American culture—who may speak publicly, who may be defended—has changed for the better since late 1991, rendering much of Death Certificate’s sexism, homophobia, racism and anti-Semitism antiquated. At the same time, however, the rest of the album—a Black artist forcefully arguing for Black unity and freedom in the face of looming, state-sanctioned mortality—remains as sadly as relevant as ever. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misidentified Khalid Abdul Muhammad, the onetime Nation of Islam spokesperson featured on Death Certificate.\"],[22648,\"At first blush, Redemption, the new Dawn Richard record, feels like a victory lap. The conclusion to a trilogy of albums, Redemption signifies the end of a project that felt, at one point, as if its completion were uncertain, between shifting collaborators and Richard's brief 2014 reunion with the girl group Danity Kane. Redemption's opening tracks also seem to confirm that it's intended as the inverse to its predecessor, 2015's Blackheart, the sound of which was thick and full of dissonance; Redemption initially feels weightless. As it progresses, though, it reveals a depth that's both distinct from its predecessors and draws on them both. Richard's 2013 album, Goldenheart, seemed to describe a disintegrating relationship that had ascended into myth; Richard positioned herself as if she were engaged in battle with her own emotions, and through metaphor her emotions had swollen into literal giants. “Faced the beast with my bare hands\\/Tried to break me down with all his strength,” she sang in “Goliath.” Blackheart was more slippery, a vortex of introspection in which Richard’s grasp of metaphor seemed to deliberately loosen, so that mythical figures like Calypso and the Titans coexisted with the thrum of amphetamines and the slur of depression.If Goldenheart is aggressive and Blackheart is depressive, Redemption is reflective. This is a curious position from which to record a dance record; the dance floor is rarely characterized as a reflective space. More often it is utopian, escapist, a portal to an alternate reality. In the first proper song, “Love Under Lights,” Richard paints her own dance floor vision. She encounters a woman in a Led Zeppelin shirt, and they start to talk about music. “She said she fucking with Drake\\/I said King Kendrick,” Richard sings as the synthetic pulses behind her ripple and gleam. “I guess we’re kindred spirits.” Richard conceives of the dance floor as a place of protest (“Black Crimes”), of contemplation (“Voices”), of engagement (“Vines”), all of which are components of desire, whether for another person or another life. The drums behind her shatter and reorganize themselves into new rhythms throughout the album , as if they’re building and disassembling digital chandeliers.The production on Redemption is distinct from the glassy backdrops her former collaborator and manager Druski provided on Goldenheart, and it's a deliberate move away from Blackheart's production, which felt like being sucked into a whirlpool. Blackheart’s primary producer, Noisecastle III, appears twice on Redemption, on “Black Crimes” and “LA,” but his more collagist aesthetic blends seamlessly with the sound world that Machinedrum and Richard build, an incandescent fusion of the organic and the synthetic, the electronic and the acoustic.The notes that open “Voices,” while digitally manipulated and multiplied, sound like they've been issued from a bass clarinet. The bass tones that break through the surface of “Renegades” are oddly reminiscent of a tuba. “LA” is a parallel ode to Louisiana, where Richard was born, and Los Angeles, where Richard lives now; it mutates from a stuttered, ultramodern gleam into a spiraling guitar solo that sounds imported from a ’70s jazz fusion album. Then the melody shifts again, this time performed by a polyphonic brass band arranged by Trombone Shorty to resemble a New Orleans second line parade. The integrity of Richard's voice provides the through line, which is often caught in ghostly tangles of itself or locking into prismatic harmonies, similar to how Prince or D’Angelo treated their voices. On the interludes, which are often as fully formed as the actual songs, Richard isolates and distorts her voice until it seems to separate into kilobytes. “Hey Nikki” is the closest the album comes to settling into an R&B tradition: It's an inversion of Prince’s “Darling Nikki,” considering the character through a different lens; instead of viewing her as an object of desire, it isolates her agency, and the song generates its desire from the aura of that agency. (Blackheart did the same thing with the titular character of Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean.”) Richard’s voice floats above the music in the verses, but  doubles, deepens, and fights through a menacing haze in the chorus: “Hey Nikki\\/Don't you wanna come and get with me?”After “Hey Nikki” the album descends into a more introspective space. “Sands” describes a past relationship; In “The Louvre” she elevates someone into “a work of art” as a way of letting them go, and then the record itself lets go of its own instrumentation as it segues the outro, “Valhalla.” Richard, her voice heavily processed, finally glimpses her utopia; it is one “where rebels are the majority\\/And my color isn't a minority.” The tone is one of arrival after a long struggle, but there are hints, too, that this maybe a fantasy: “Escape,” she sings, and it feels as if her promised land was a mirage, forever shimmering just out of reach.\"],[22531,\"Through most of What’s Your Sign?, the new album by veteran maximalist composer Rhys Chatham and Brooklyn DIY drone-blasters Oneida, Chatham takes only minimal steps into the spotlight. Perhaps inverting the usual super-session logic, Chatham’s guitar and trumpet blend convincingly into Oneida’s 15-year-running noisenik dynamic, while the quintet channel the power of Chatham’s work. The 35-minute LP never achieves the epic scale that both can work at—Chatham with his armies of up to 400 guitarists, Oneida via their rigorous eight-hour-straight Ocropolis performances—but each of the six tracks generates a be-here-now flash of present-tense psychedelia, hallucinations by way of overtones and volume.Missing a monumental centerpiece, What's Your Sign? comes closest with the nine-minute “Well Tuned Guitar,” its title referencing the microtonal work of Chatham’s one-time teacher, the psychedelic minimalist La Monte Young. Building towards slashing chords—and Chatham’s big spotlight—the drama draws from the rhythmic language Chatham has been refining since 1977’s “Guitar Trio,” written after seeing the Ramones at CBGB. It’s perhaps the only place the pairing doesn’t completely click. In the hands of Oneida, while still sounding convincingly enormous, the approach also feels slightly contained, as if following a map instead of the terrain itself. Oneida’s semi-formalist mind-exploding can be heard more vividly on the disc-opening “You Get Brighter,” an exercise in forward motion driven by drummer Kid Millions, a propulsion that seems as if it could keep expanding outwards forever. Chatham’s guitar bends and freaks with the rest of the Oneida brahs, his voice adding to the song’s one-line refrain, both a signpost and conductor’s baton.Oneida sometimes function more like a liquid light show than a traditional rock band. They most often concern themselves with a swirl of repetition, the type of music where—watching live—it’s not always possible to tell who is making what sound, perhaps not even for those playing in the band, either. Chatham and Oneida’s music feels most natural in these places, using the change of texture as a form of a movement. On a pair of drumless jams, “Bad Brains” and “The Mabinogian,” the music never stops pressing into the unknown, the driving pulse only heard in the negative space between oscillations. The music itself could be coming from any combination of the three guitarists and two keyboardists, a free improv counterpoint to the full-throttle rhythmic spectacles heard elsewhere.The balance of What's Your Sign? makes it feel like an Oneida album, built on power and cosmic eruptions. Besides the Positions EP (featuring a driving cover of This Heat's “S.P.Q.R.”), it’s the band’s first proper release in four years. In the interim, they’ve transformed even more fully into a live act; in 2013, a 48-minute set-opening incarnation of “You Get Brighter” did almost expand outwards forever. Besides the touch of Chatham’s compositional hand on “Well Tuned Guitar,” What's Your Sign? is another sliver of Oneida’s ever-jamming life, a place both unpredictable and consistent, where collaborators like Chatham might arrive and make themselves at home. Even tracks that start out sounding nothing like Oneida fall easily into the band’s gravity well. On “A. Phillip Randolph at Back Bay Station,” after Chatham strikes a gentle keynote with layered flute, the band quickly lifts into a group glide over a rolling snare drum sea.Chatham’s trumpet loops finally break through and take over the four minutes of the album-closing “Civil Weather.” It’s a mode that one wouldn’t expect to find Oneida exploring, more Jon Hassell-like Fourth World bliss than kosmiche fire music, a trumpet clearing a central path down the middle of Oneida space. But in plenty of other ways—sure, why not? It’s a new place they find together, the kind of spot they might get to for a few minutes one night when the tapers didn’t make it out, and then never try again. With more than one What’s Your Sign? track fading to delighted in-studio laughter, it’s only a surprise when it ends so soon.\"],[22533,\"Like a lot of minimalist art, Sarah Davachi’s music appears simple on the surface. Not a lot seems to happen, at least not in terms of melody, rhythm, or any of the usual categories of Western popular music: Her music consists mainly of long held tones. The real action is not found in the notes themselves but in their microtonal variations and the wealth of overtones, harmonics, and ghostly pulses produced by the friction between them. Her work belongs to a tradition of deep, shimmering drone music that includes Eliane Radigue, Kevin Drumm, Phill Niblock, La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela, and Folke Rabe.Despite its apparent restraint, Davachi’s music is also profoundly expressive. Her filters sweep back and forth in slow, deliberate, and often unpredictable movements that suggest the careful thought process that drives the hand behind them. The subtlest change can set in motion complicated chain reactions—ebbing and flowing, wheels turning within wheels. Play her music in a quiet room on good speakers and you can practically see the air moving around your head.In part, this has to do with her tools. Davachi, who studied electronic music at Mills College, in Oakland, California, typically works with a mixture of acoustic and electronic sources, or even purely acoustic instruments. Her album All My Circles Run, from earlier this year, is a set of studies for overdubbed strings, voice, organ, and piano. On Vergers, she turns her attention to the EMS Synthi 100, an analog synthesizer from the early 1970s, and complements its unusually vibrant tone with almost imperceptible additions of voice and violin.It is her most minimal album yet. Its three long tracks initially feel almost static; they evolve so stealthily that it's easy to find yourself adrift in the middle, wondering just how you got there. The opening “Gentle So Gentle,” nearly 22 minutes long, begins with a single octave, its tones wavering like heat mirages. A minute passes; then two. It takes a while to notice a pair of quiet background tones, glowing like street lights in fog. In time, it will come to feel like all seven notes of a minor scale are resonating in blurry unison. Timbres shift; tones fatten. For a spell, the sound resembles a piano whose sustain pedal has been held down. Then, a pair of clarinets. Fifteen minutes in, and the atmosphere turns celestial for its final passage. The piece begins on a different note than the one with which it began, and even though you probably won't notice it, that shift lends an extra element of tension. There is no resolution; it is a question with no answer, an imperative to keep moving.Where “Gentle So Gentle” is shot through with light, “Ghosts and All” is charged with dread. Over buzzing pedal tones, thin, violin-like textures saw queasily back and forth, like a camera panning across a burned forest. It is as bleak as the grimmest doom metal. Once again, she proves herself a master manipulator of frequency, stacking up layers until even the root note is lost in the miasma, and you're left disoriented, unable to find your footing.The third and final track, “In Staying,” uses similar strategies, but it's immediately distinguishable from its companions. (Proof that Davachi is not your average drone artist is her facility for evoking wildly different universes with such a modest set of tools.) The sound evokes church bells that have been frozen in mid-peal. New tones bleed into earshot, and the bells melt away. Now we are inside a glacier, perhaps; the time scale is unfathomably long. Inside the sound, made one with the all-encompassing hum, a million tiny vibrations collide. If timbre is one of Davachi’s primary materials, time is another—thus her all-enveloping matrix of infinite ripple—and with “In Staying,” she manages a feat that is nearly impossible in music: She makes time itself seem to stand stock still.  \"],[22637,\"Pianist Vicky Chow has been building a discography focused on modern classical sounds ever since completing her studies at Juilliard and the Manhattan School of Music. She appeared on a release from John Zorn’s Tzadik imprint, and interpreted the music of John Cage. More recently, she made a star turn on a Steve Reich album. Though Chow is obviously a virtuoso when it comes to acoustic work, she has also shown an interest in pieces that employ electronics. Her premiere of Reich’s “Piano Counterpoint” required her to play against pre-recorded parts; Chow’s recording of composer Tristan Perich’s Surface Image found the pianist threading notes in between 40 channels of chirping, 1-bit sound. Due to that resume, it’s hardly a shock to discover that Chow’s sophomore album for the New Amsterdam label involves electro-acoustic setups. A O R T A features pieces from six up-and-coming composers, each of whom pushes the limits of the instrument in some way. Christopher Cerrone’s “Hoyt-Schermerhorn” has an icy profile, at first, as softly played progressions creep slowly into the piano’s highest reaches. But when a rising figure in a low octave is introduced, Chow’s playing communicates the effusive release embedded in those notes (even as the overall harmony remains melancholic). Unusually dense layers of sustain are the product of an electronic patch created by the composer. But even when Cerrone’s digital design asserts itself more clearly—via glitchy, refracted notes—the center of the piece holds.  Another winner is Molly Joyce’s “Rave.” The work starts out sounding anything but exultant, sporting motifs that seem emotionally mismatched. (In the score, Joyce’s description of a tempo as “controlled but on the edge” seems appropriate.) As the composition develops, Joyce’s lines achieve an odd syncopation, and ultimately a sense of balance strong enough to suggest a club-influenced feel. There is a potent sense of physicality in Chow’s performance of that piece—one which also carries over to Andy Akiho’s “Vick(i\\/y).” Written for Chow and fellow pianist Vicki Ray, Akiho’s prepared-piano opus stretches the range of the instrument by calling for the direct strumming of strings inside the piano’s body. That technique isn’t a new one. But Akiho’s use of it here serves percussive and melodic ends that prove structurally satisfying, when traditional-sounding lines sprout and shoot away from the modernist opening material.The rest of the hour-long program isn’t quite on the same level as those compositions, though the pieces are all worth hearing. Jacob Cooper’s “Clifton Gates” is a clever homage to John Adams’s famous minimalist composition “Phrygian Gates.” Jakub Ciupinksi’s four-movement “Morning Tale” has moments of dramatic propulsion. Two movements from Daniel Wohl’s “Aorta” contain the composer’s typical blend of jabbing aggression and dreamy fluidity. Though without a full performance of the work, its impression is necessarily muted. Chow handles these composers’ various electronic setups with grace, never letting the tech overwhelm the particular aesthetic. Arrangement eccentricities aside, the most notable quality of A O R T A is the pianist’s deep, evident investment in these consistently rewarding pieces.\"],[22647,\"It’s not clear whether Free Bricks 2: Zone 6 Edition is supposed to exist. Future and Gucci Mane’s new six-song exercise has been scrubbed from the Soundcloud page that birthed it and left to kick around in inconspicuous tracks bundles or in the YouTube ether. It came with no warning and left with little fanfare, a nineteen-minute exhale from two of the most visible and, probably, overworked rappers in the world. Unless one of these songs pops off under new packaging, Free Bricks 2 is probably going to come and go (The Return of East Atlanta Santa in stores December 16). Which is a shame, because Free Bricks 2 is pretty potent dose of what makes Future and Gucci Mane so magnetic.Written and recorded in less than 24 hours, the sequel to 2011’s Free Bricks is fresh to a fault, with a few cadences that could have been smoothed out, a few points where Gucci still sounds as if he’s getting his post-prison footing. (Speaking of timeliness and Terre Haute, an otherwise unmemorable line about Monica Lewinsky from opener “RR Trucks” sticks in your brain because of Gucci’s heart-wrenching get out the vote speech from earlier this month.) Also endearing: two cult heroes decide to open their new record with a song about maybe, at some indeterminate point in the future, buying a new car they’ve heard about.“Selling Heroin,” which Southside furnishes with a beautiful bounce is, decidedly, a Gucci Mane song. This proves to be a freeing thing for Future. Since Honest was received coolly by his hardcore fanbase, the preposterously good-looking Atlantan has retreated to his wheelhouse. The career-defining run that began on Monster, became codified on 56 Nights, and culminated with last July’s DS2 was built almost exclusively on songs that forewent the joy or R&B experimentation of his first two LPs. Here, Future comes unhinged just a little; most importantly, he sounds like he’s having fun. As for Gucci, he’s been on a slow ramp up since his release from custody. This summer’s Everybody Looking was solid, but would have been unremarkable if it came out during his storied mixtape run; last month’s Woptober has more world-class rapping than its predecessor, but no songs that will significantly alter the Gucci canon. While his pen seems mostly intact, the Zone 6 legend can’t quite find the right vocal register, what with the massive weight loss and newfound sobriety. This is likely to be sorted out soon, but in the meantime there are moments when he sounds like he’s searching. There are also brief passages where Gucci’s vocals come unmoored from the beat in a way his more laconic early-Obama self seldom did. But Gucci finds the pocket frequently on Free Bricks 2, and the result is always a joy. On “Die a Gangsta,” he raps: “They call me East Atlanta Santa, I’ma fuck up the profit\\/I’m the Grinch that stole Christmas, I might go in your stocking\\/I’m talking, too cocky, I got so much juice\\/My wrist is too rocky, they done let Wop loose.” Even if Future’s cool disaffect is en vogue, Gucci is the record’s emotional center, and when he’s booking luxe hotel room penthouses for shooters or buying his sixteenth Bentley, he’s the only rapper in the world you want to listen to. That’s the insane gravitational pull that Gucci’s somehow managed to harness: when he’s on, not only is he endlessly listenable, he renders his fiercest competition an afterthought. Free Bricks 2 benefits from a superb production lineup—Southside and Metro Boomin split duties, except for when they pass the baton to Zaytoven, who’s played a crucial role in ushering each rapper into the limelight. Zay helms “Kind a Dope,” the record’s highlight, where Gucci channels Ridin’ Dirty and raps, “When you was playing basketball, man, I was playing Pimp C.” This little piece of Gucci's legacy is forgotten, and it’s the crux of why a tape like this can be so impressive; even if Future and Gucci Mane are cast as instinctive, impulsive savants, each is drawing on a wealth of musical knowledge that informs their work. Free Bricks 2 will likely get lost in the shuffle, but it’s the sound of two superlative talents working without boundaries. \"],[22614,\"“If any of y’all wanna give me shit about my twang, you can just do it,” Gillian Welch once told a chatty San Francisco crowd in 1994. It was two years before Welch would release her debut Revival, but the California-bred daughter of two entertainers was already anticipating the skepticism that would greet her when she rose to prominence in the mid-to-late ’90s singing about destitute coal miners and Depression-era whiskey runners with an unsettling familiarity for someone born in New York City, raised in Los Angeles, and who found their lifetime musical partner at a conservatory in Boston. In 1994, Welch’s repertoire consisted largely of a number of songs that would never find their way onto a record, a handful of traditional tunes, and some John Prine covers. For an artist with an aesthetic as carefully and consistently rendered as Gillian Welch, it’s strange to think of a time when she wasn’t producing or reproducing that aesthetic, but was, rather, searching for it herself.That sense of fresh discovery and wide-eyed experimentation can be heard plainly on Boots No. 1, Welch’s first archival release that serves as a 20th anniversary expanded release for her debut LP.  The two-disc collection is comprised of outtakes, demos, and alternate takes culled from the Revival sessions, a time when Welch and guitarist Dave Rawlings were first honing in on their precise sound, mood, and style. “There really was no me. The artist Gillian Welch didn’t really exist,” Welch has said of the sessions, “And then after that, I did.”Welch’s spectral country music has always felt otherworldly in its ability to evoke feelings, memories and atmosphere on command. “Sound [that] holds moods the way humid air holds smells,” is how writer Jedediah Purdy has described it. Part of the revelation of Boots No. 1, then, is witnessing Welch’s music made mortal, to hear her navigating her many influences with a young artist’s enlightened uncertainty, and to hear imperfect recordings that may not necessarily conjure universes on their own accord so much as they recall old-fashioned country music that’d sound at home on the radio.Some of the most thrilling moments on this 21-song release are just that: hit records. “455 Rocket” is a hand-clapping muscle car ode in which Welch deadpans goofy lines likes like, “Whose junk pile piece of sh….Chevelle is this?” “Dry Town” is a talking country-blues Johnny Cash pastiche about craving a six-pack for the road. The former became a hit for country singer Kathy Mattea in 1997, while the latter ended up, a decade later, on Miranda Lambert’s chart-topping Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.Nevertheless, witnessing gradual transformation can be revelatory, and several early takes lay bare the process of refining Gillian Welch into “Gillian Welch” with staggering clarity. The version of “Paper Wings” that made its way to the final album is much slower, sparser, and jazz-leaning than the honky-tonk demo. Moments like this show how greatly producer T Bone Burnett’s subtle aesthetics helped sculpt Welch’s sound.Listening to the original Revival now, it’s astounding to hear all the constructed artifices and delicate contemporary flourishes that were so easy to overlook when the album first came out. The closing moments of “Orphan Girl,” Welch’s first signature tune, reveal a shocking swirl of grungy guitar feedback and tape distortion. “One More Dollar” is just one of several songs with a crisp, full rhythm section, a reminder that Welch and Rawlings wouldn’t settle into their now-famous acoustic duo format until 1998’s follow up Hell Among the Yearlings.As several of these new songs also affirm, Welch’s third-person storylines often point inwards at moving autobiography. Like so much of Revival, “Wichita” and “Riverboat Song” are stories of movement and motion that trace both the thrill of fleeing home and the lonely alienation of being a stranger in the big city. Both songs were written just a year after Welch and Rawlings had moved to Nashville, a period when the two singers lived a ghostly existence spent largely recording music in the middle of the night by themselves.Part of Welch and Rawlings’ aura is the sense that their music exists out of time, so it’s illuminating to hear the two artists conversing so intimately with contemporary genres and artists. They cover Robert Earl Keen and later, respond to him in song with “I Don’t Want to Go Downtown.” Lyrically, “Barroom Girls” is an equal-rights-to-party anthem that would’ve sounded at home on a Lilith Fair mainstage. On the other hand, “Pass You by” is strikingly loud, just a full drum-kit away from sounding like an outtake on Wilco’s roots-grunge opus Being There, released six months after Revival.   All of which goes to show that the authenticity scare that surrounded Welch upon her arrival feels, twenty years later, almost unrecognizably dated. Perhaps it’s because Welch herself, who would go on to play an integral role in Americana’s big-bang O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack just a few years later, has since become the very aesthetic and artistic paradigm for 21st-century roots singer-songwriters. Or, perhaps, it’s because the anxieties about Welch’s authentic credentials were so misguided in the first place.  \"],[22622,\"If you know the feeling of being jolted awake at 3 AM by every outstanding obligation in your life, you'll recognize the paralyzing anxiety embedded in the lyrics of Jeff Rosenstock’s third solo LP. To wit: “Ignorance is bliss until the day\\/The things you ignored all come into focus.” When those things emerge, they will waylay you with the same nagging, needling and relentless tone that knows every single pressure point in your system. Rosenstock has always sung like this, so WORRY. isn’t a case of an artist finding his voice. Rather, it’s an artist finding his muse—it's right there in the title—and making the record of his life.Rosenstock didn’t really need a magnum opus to solidify his reputation as one of the most important figures in modern punk music—in certain circles, he’s basically an Ian MacKaye figure, a paragon of ethics whose web-based, pay-what-you-want record label gave him legitimate reason to feel salty when Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead were called revolutionaries for doing the same thing years later. However, he was doing this as the leader of a ska-punk project called the Arrogant Sons of Bitches and, later, Bomb the Music Industry! As the names of these acts might imply, this stuff wasn’t bound for mainstream acceptance, though Rosenstock’s sonic and philosophical influence has been acknowledged by verbose and principled young acts like Joyce Manor, Modern Baseball, and Mitski. WORRY. isn’t an obvious crossover attempt. Rosenstock touches on almost every intersection of pop and punk, whether or not it’s credible: there are flashes of Jawbreaker’s real-talk scene reportage, the synth-spiked sugar rushes of the Anniversary and the Get Up Kids, but also previously canonical touchstones that have become relegated to Boomerism nostalgia: the Beach Boys, the Clash, and Abbey Road. After the beer-hoisting nostalgia of “Blast Damage Days,” WORRY. unexpectedly (and hilariously) hits double time and tries to cram Rosenstock’s entire discography into a Side B medley, breathlessly running through Twista-paced spitfire punk, 30-second blasts of D-beat hardcore and an unashamedly infectious ska song.WORRY. is rife with similarly invigorating and wildly unfashionable touches—the Reggie and the Full Effect-style electropop intro of “Festival Song,” his voice cracking on the line, “So we made out foooooor the entire ride” like drunken Rivers Cuomo karaoke. “I wanna listen to the Cribs my dear, while we make out in your car,” he sings on “Pash Rash.” Among other things, Rosenstock is mounting a rousing defense of genre—“Stop sneering at our joy like it’s some careless mistake,” he snarls on “We Begged 2 Explode,” where a swaying piano ballad erupts into a kitchen-drinking singalong at a house party.  Punk usually has to sound serious to be taken seriously, and WORRY. is stuffed with so with many sugarcoated melodies it’s almost headache-inducing. Yet there isn’t a single insubstantial lyric here: it’s a record about New York gentrification, the internet, police brutality, liberal guilt, DIY idealism—crucial subject matter that typically inspire chin-stroking appreciation or eye-rolls because of their self-serious delivery.  Instead, WORRY. is an absolute blast and its heaviest stories are presented as some of the most devastating breakup songs of the past year. “Staring Out the Window at Your Old Apartment” plays on the “Is She Really Going Out With Him?” trope: “Someone hung a decorative surfboard up where your records and movies belong,” Rosenstock yells, but they still can’t hide the cracks in the wall that the landlord was never going to fix and the tacky renovations that followed. “You’ve got nowhere to go now,” he moans, in a lyric that exhibits scorn-free empathy for New Yorkers and the shitholes they’ve somehow been been priced out of. Rosenstock fondly reminisces over drinking tallboys by the water on “Wave Goodnight to Me,” written in memory of shuttered Death By Audio (and accompanied by a dead-on video). “I wish it didn’t hurt. I wish I didn’t care,” he brays, knowing that all DIY spaces are living on borrowed time and this one would eventually become the new Vice office: “They spent the last five years, yelling, ‘Come on! Come on! Come on! Get out of here!’”   Much of WORRY. is put in this “us vs. them” battleground, but Rosenstock isn’t a scold—he realizes you might not figure out you’re them until it’s too late. “Festival Song” takes easy licks at  “dorm room” music, “sweatshop denim jackets,” “department store crust punk chic,” and, well, you name it: “They wouldn’t be your friend if it wasn’t worth it\\/If you didn’t have something they could take.” His ire isn’t just limited to AEG and Live Nation pumping more hot air into a bubble that already burst, or Funyuns sponsoring whatever the hell this is. WORRY. was fittingly released right in the middle of October; it began with the NFL “going pink” as a meek gesture towards women jersey-buyers while treating domestic violence cases with less gravity than touchdown celebrations, and ended with Twitter shuttering Vine, a seemingly utopian mode of expression that in reality repeatedly exploited people of color (and still didn’t make a dime). As much as WORRY. deals in financial insecurity—the #1 worry of all—it speaks to the unshakable notion that American society is one giant game of big-bank-take-little-bank and we’re all “born as a data mine for targeted marketing,” discarded when we’re no longer in a demographic worth exploiting. Needless to say, it's become even more resonant in the past month.If this all sounds exhausting, well—would WORRY. live up to its name if it wasn’t? But there’s something reassuring about worry, how it is inextricable from daily existence, how it can reveal what’s actually meaningful when total nihilism is always a tempting option. Dropped in the middle of Rosenstock’s surveys of urban cultural decline, “I Did Something Weird Last Night” turns out to be the neurotic punk’s answer to “It Was a Good Day”—“I made out in the van with a girl I like\\/We were kinda drunk but it seemed alright,” Rosenstock yelps, explaining the title and returning to his apartment, sleeping through classes the next day and wondering when he’ll ever see her again. It’s a beautifully written song about the brief moments when irrational, giddy emotion can shout down the Voice of Worry and allow good things to happen despite everything—and also about the way people can talk themselves out of good things immediately afterwards once worry returns: “if I see you soon, will you want to see me?”; “I hope I’m not reading into this too much, it’s a kiss.”Rosenstock wrote “I Did Something Weird Last Night” about his girlfriend at the time, who is now his wife; the album’s cover art is taken from their wedding photos. But at the time, he admits, “I was preoccupied with how the magic would end\\/Because nothing intangible remains sustainable\\/Hope is a scheme.” It ties into the worry that pervades every interaction on this record, whether it’s with peers, corporations, political causes, anything—if you actually give a shit, have expectations and get your hopes up, you’re going to get played for a sucker. But later on, he shouts WORRY.’s most cathartic and reassuring line and like most others, if you’re not paying attention, you might miss what this album is really about: “Love is worry.”\"],[22636,\"Listening to a Kristin Hersh album is like receiving, unfiltered, a direct feed of someone’s thoughts, with all the internal symbols, memories, private jokes intact before they apply all the translation and explanation and interpretation to the outside world. One gets the sense she’s still trying to sort through it all herself. For this reason, her music inevitably is called “abstract”; it’s an understandable reaction, but totally inaccurate. Kristin Hersh writes in specifics. Her memoir Rat Girl—alternately titled Paradoxical Undressing, a typically allegorical reference to hypothermia patients stripping off their clothes even as they freeze to death—sheds light on a couple dozen of her and Throwing Muses’ tracks. Her songs are full of references to her own material,anecdotes that slip out in interviews and on stage, blunt and hyper-specific wisecracks. Singer-songwriters, particularly women, are often accused of writing confessional material even (especially?) when they’re not, but Hersh’s material generally is. “I haven’t got the kind of brain to invent anything, so I just write the stuff down that happens,” she told Soundblab. “The things that happened are so bizarre, you can’t make those things up.” Wyatt at the Coyote Palace (named for one of her sons) is a typically personal and idiosyncratic affair. Like all her solo and Throwing Muses studio releases since 2010’s Crooked, Wyatt at the Coyote Palace is accompanied by a book of essays and artwork: less commentary on the tracks, and more another set of puzzle pieces to put together. (As well as a recipe for “hooker gazpacho.”) Like 1999’s Sky Motel, the sonics are rich; in addition to acoustic guitar, Hersh plays bass, drums, piano, horns, and cello, and engineer Steve Rizzo helps make it among her slickest-sounding recordings. After five years of tweaking results, she builds many of the arrangements to the beefiness of a typical Muses track; others are interspersed with muffled field recordings, an effect like hearing songs through mental fog. Like the Throwing Muses comeback album Purgatory\\/Paradise, the album is fragmentary and self-referential; songs reappear throughout the album in reprises, or reworks of and callbacks to past material.And like her 2001 solo effort Sunny Border Blue, the album is viscerally preoccupied with loss: “I'm so fucking tired of dissolution,” Hersh says in “Sun Blown.” Sometimes it’s general loss—the running joke throughout the album’s accompanying essays is Hersh and her bandmates’ brushes with death, both funny and sneakily serious (a fair amount of essays end in the hospital). A few years ago Hersh divorced from her husband of 25 years. It’s crept into all her work since—last year’s book Don’t Suck Don’t Die started out as a eulogy for singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt but became a concurrent eulogy for the two songwriters’ marriages. But “Sun Blown” is perhaps the most explicit she's been: “The bailing mate dance, failing patience, fool's silver...” Like most of Hersh’s imagery, it’s not oblique at all when you get the reference: in this case, silver being the traditional 25th anniversary gift. The verse appears as a refrain throughout the album: leading into “Green Screen” and its descending counterpoint of a melody: “Red skin blackening, what is happening? The Art of Kissing, the heart of missing you.” Unsurprisingly, this is heavy listening. “Shaky Blue Can,” “Shotgun” (reminiscent of “Terra Nova”) and “Secret Codes” are up there with “Listerine” and “Flooding” as among the most fragile material Hersh has recorded. But her work is always threaded through with levity; these songs resist easy classification. “Detox” breaks through into anger—confrontational lyrics, distorted guitar solo—but the almost poppy “Wonderland” recalls the Muses’ midcareer singles; “Hemingway’s Tell” could easily be adapted into one. For every bracing line like “everyone like me’s a dead man,” there’s a gnomic one-liner like “Incense, strawberry candles and soap—way to butcher a street.” The former track, “Killing Two Birds,” is deceptively cheery—the essay accompanying it sets it during a teenage coke-fueled jog. The latter, “Between Piety and Desire” (like Purgatory\\/Paradise, a play on street names) becomes a “we don’t like the shit, ‘cause we belong in it.” The “we” is key. As memoirs, her albums are so intensely personal it’s little wonder she’s amassed a cult fanbase (and cadre of crowdfunders); as art, they’re arguments for the value of unapologetic individuality. \"],[22629,\"The past twenty five years haven’t exactly been kind to Metallica. Ever since their mainstream-rock apotheosis on 1991’s Metallica, they’ve faced a quarter-century losing streak: the bloated hard rock of Load, Reload, and Garage Inc., the snoozy live album-cum-orchestral-experiment S&M, the migraine-inducing ineptitude of St. Anger, and the recycled rage of Death Magnetic. In 2011, they teamed up with Lou Reed for Lulu, a collaborative concept album regarded by many as music’s answer to The Room—if Tommy Wiseau’s classic was twice as ambitious and half as competent—and the band’s undeniable low point (and that’s even with the tell-all masochism of 2003’s documentary Some Kind of Monster). Money, fame, age, a lack of passion: Critics have floated several culprits for the mediocrity of latter-day Metallica. But as drummer Lars Ulrich suggested in a recent Rolling Stone interview, the wellspring of the band’s foibles also forms the basis of Metallica writ large. “The thing that I love about Metallica is that we’re very impulsive,” Ulrich said, before tacking on a subtle mea culpa: “That impulsivity occasionally bites us in the ass, because we jump before we know where we're landing.”And so, five years after hooking up with Lou, and eight years after their last album proper, Metallica have taken yet another leap with Hardwired...to Self-Destruct, a two-disc collection demarcated not by a leap into the unknown, but into the halcyon days of their youth nearly three decades ago during thrash’s primordial period, when “impulsivity” amounted to unpredictable fretwork, breakneck rhythms, and discarded pretenses. Like Death Magnetic, the record attempts a self-conscious return to form; the only difference is that this time the band sound like they’re actually trying, and–dare I say it–maybe even having a bit of fun. Hardwired...to Self-Destruct is a rare Metallica album without any Kirk Hammett songwriting credits, a  shift owed not to Some Kind of Monster-type bickering, but flat-out carelessness: The guitarist lost an iPhone containing roughly 250 riffs, leaving him with little to contribute to the think tank by the time Metallica began cutting the album. Temporarily demoted from puppet master to personnel, Hammett readily embraces–relishes, even–his role as primary ambassador for Metallica nostalgia. Hardwired… stands as the guitarist’s most extensive show of muscle since the self-titled days. From the soaring, bluesy triplets on “Atlas, Rise!” to the fleet-footed stampedes driving “Spit Out the Bone,” his playing strikes a winning compromise between precision and wildness, lending the otherwise one-dimensional mix (undermined primarily by the anemic drum tracking, which renders Ulrich’s bass kicks little more than footsie taps) some welcome textural spontaneity.As for spontaneity on a broader level—don’t head into Hardwired... hoping for progressive surprises or unanticipated turns. Its twelve songs–the vast majority of which extend well past the five-minute mark–fall into two categories: galloping nods to Ride the Lightning, of which the first disc is primarily composed, and doomier mid-tempo cuts à la Sabbath, which make up the bulk of the second. The LP’s highlights—“Hardwired,” “Moth Into Flame,” “Atlas, Rise!” all fall into the former camp, front-loading the record with fire. The second disc, by contrast, is a slog through nondescript, uniform chug, devoid of dynamics or instrumental nuance: “Confusion”’s dull roar proves practically indistinguishable from the slow-churning gyre of “ManUNkind” or “Here Comes Revenge,” and the clunky mainframe of “Murder One” borders on incoherent. Fortunately, they finish strong with “Spit Out the Bone,” a galvanizing, hyper-speed premonition of a world razed to the ground by man’s greed for shiny playthings (like, say, Hammett’s iPhone): “Plug into me and terminate\\/Accelerate, Utopian solution\\/Finally cure the Earth of Man.” A little less than three minutes in, the band automize fiercely, careening off the leaden path into a pummeling breakdown unheard since the glory days.  Elsewhere, James Hetfield redeems himself as Metallica’s growling figurehead with his strongest work in decades. The band’s 2014 tribute medley to fallen star Ronnie James Dio (which appears on the deluxe edition of Hardwired…) has clearly left a lasting impression on the 53-year-old, vocally and lyrically: whereas past releases found Hetfield howling the blues and roaringly introducing himself as literal furniture, Hardwired… marks a return to the matter-of-fact, staccato doomsday proselytizing of the band’s heyday. When he barks “We’re so fucked\\/Shit out of luck,” on the title track, teeth bared, fists clenched, we feel the pulse of his reckless youth ever-so-slightly—and for a second, the multi-millionaire feels like one of us, shaking in timely trepidation at the realization of the world’s greatest fears. And yet, even as he manages to rein in the cringeworthy wailing exhibited on St. Anger and the Load albums, he can’t resist backsliding into melodrama—obnoxiously extending out his syllables on “Now That We’re Dead” (“Now that we’re dead my DEEE-AHH we can be TOGETH-AHH”)–and on “Dream No More,” letting out a grunge-era whine that sounds like a failed impersonation of late legend Scott Weiland. Make no mistake—Hardwired... is easily Metallica’s best album since 1991’s landmark self-titled LP, a victory on par with Weezer’s White Album for comeback of the year. But as was the case with Cuomo and company, the album fails to convince non-diehards what, exactly, we look for from Metallica these days. Even after repeat listens, one can’t shake the feeling that in 2016, the legends’ students have become their teachers in terms of both sheer volume and political gravitas; those looking for fresh thrash, in its purest, most primal form are better off listening to the likes of Vektor, Power Trip, or Iron Reagan, who wave the torch of their forebears with considerably more gusto. Still, the band couldn’t return at a better time: when you flip on the news and see a narcissistic, trigger-fingered, despotic cheetoh at the podium—a Metallica song come to life—there’s no denying that the accessible aggro makes for a surprisingly potent balm, not to mention an enjoyable form of escapism. \"],[22534,\"Porter Ricks, the duo of Andy Mellwig and Thomas Köner, weren’t around for long, but they left an indelible stamp on the legacy of what came to be known as dub techno. Ironically, there was never very much dub in their work—not in the way that you could hear it ricocheting through the work of their colleagues Basic Channel, for instance, upon whose Chain Reaction label Porter Ricks released their debut album, in 1996. In Basic Channel’s music, dub is a root, transplanted from Jamaica, that will eventually branch into the full-scale reggae of their later Rhythm & Sound project. In Porter Ricks’ music, dub is less a root than a route, a way of tracing the path a sound can travel through the convoluted guts of the recording studio. In Porter Ricks’ short, largely bulletproof catalog—save for a few exploratory detours on their second album, into hip-hop and Chicago house, that probably would have been better left untaken—drum machines are run through maze-like circuits until nothing remains but the infrared signature they have left in their wake. Their commitment to conjuring whole worlds out of little more than crackle and echo cast a long shadow, even though they put the project on hold after three short years. Without Porter Ricks, it’s hard to imagine Pole, Shackleton, Burial, or any number of artists working in the most densely crosshatched corners of electronic music. Their last album was 1999’s Symbiotics, a split LP with Techno Animal (the industrial duo of Kevin Martin, later known as the Bug, and Justin K. Broadrick, a veteran of a host of bands like Napalm Death, Godflesh, and Ice) on which their gravelly sound came to resemble something alive and malevolent, their synths’ jagged waveforms glinting like the teeth of a snarling animal.On their first new work in 17 years, not much has outwardly changed—and really, that’s the best possible scenario. When they called it quits, they were still in the process of pushing their sound forward, so for them to pick up where they left off is a welcome development. Shadow Boat consists of just three tracks, but they cover a considerable amount of ground. “Harbour Chart” creeps ahead at 60 beats per minute, faint kick and hi-hat all but subsumed in a maelstrom of foghorns and static. “Bay Rouge” is faster, a brisk andante of glancing chords and metallic textures. The timing of the release couldn't be more perfect, given the way the track's movements mimic kicking up piles of dry autumn leaves; the whole thing is crisp, chilly, and brooding. “Shadow Boat” is the longest, quickest, and most intense of the bunch, a headlong tumble into a wind-tunnel rave, its synths rattling like a broken screen.Porter Ricks always excelled at sketching out sweeping, subaquatic expanses—ironically, their name comes from a character on the 1960s television series Flipper, a children’s show about a dolphin, even though there’s nothing cuddly about their music—and that continues to be the case here; the sense of space suggested by all three tracks is immense, practically unbounded. For years, most dub techno records have concerned themselves with nothing more than dub techno itself, but Shadow Boat tackles bigger ideas: Its main subject is the interplay of uncontrollable forces. All three tracks, balancing four-to-the-floor beats with unpredictable explosions of sandblasted tone, explore the tension between steadiness and turmoil. On the one hand, the certainty of timekeeping; on the other, things ripped loose from their fixtures. (“Shadow Boat” would have made a great soundtrack to Alfonso Cuarón’s Gravity, playing the regularity of the spacecraft’s orbit against its spectacularly violent pulverization.) Ultimately, it’s not about chaos, exactly, but something like it: unpredictable, dubwise chain reactions that leave us cowed and awestruck—patterns whose complexity we can scarcely begin to apprehend.\"],[22565,\"“ring spiel” tour ’95 captures one night in a superstar tour that assembled in support of the legendary Mike Watt’s  first solo album, Ball-Hog or Tugboat?  The former-Minutemen bass player turned fIREHOSE band leader gathered an insane and unlikely roster of alternative-rock superstars to not only support his album, but follow him on tour. Evan Dando, Kathleen Hanna, Ad-Rock and Mike D, Eddie Vedder, the Kirkwood brothers, Dave Pirner, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, J Mascis, Nels Cline, half of Sonic Youth, and Mark Lanegan— these are just a few of the names in the long, long credits list. The title of the live record, recorded at the Metro in Chicago on May 6, 1995, references Watt’s concept of Ball-Hog or Tugboat? as being a wrestling match, where each group of musicians “got in the ring” with Watt.The touring band for “ring spiel” would end up being Grohl, Vedder, Pat Smear, and William Goldsmith, freshly ex-Sunny Day Real Estate and newly christened Foo Fighter. Opening were Hovercraft, the multi-media project helmed by Beth Liebling (whose husband happened to be Vedder) and the then-fledgling Foo Fighters. The tour was run according to Watt’s ‘we jam econo’ ethos from back in the Minutemen days; there were no fancy tour buses, no blacked-out windows; everyone was in a van, driving themselves to gigs, 31 shows in 42 days, the kind of thing that Watt could do in his sleep. The kids, although they were more famous, needed to keep up.The tickets were sold as a Mike Watt show, and as the liner notes (written by Michael Azerrad) point out, promoters were under strict instructions to not use Grohl or Vedder to promote the tour. But the jig was up, not because of local promoters trying to sell tickets, but because of fan networks on the internet. The Nirvana, Pearl Jam and even Foo Fighters fan bases were already well-entrenched, and word travelled fast, via Usenet and BBS and listserv. Then MTV showed up to a gig and poked their nose around, and any pretense of subterfuge was gone. Vedder could wear a floppy hat and drum in back of Hovercraft’s video projections all he wanted to, but the remaining shows, all in theaters and clubs, far below Pearl Jam or Nirvana capacities, sold out quickly. This was undoubtedly bittersweet: on the one hand, getting Watt in front of a larger audience was surely part of the point of the parade of stars on the record; on the other, the star power's ability to hang back in the shadows was gone, the Halloween costume (in the case of Vedder, a wig) removed.But the newfound attention didn’t distract the band from the task at hand: the show. “ring spiel” tour ’95 catches the band about halfway through the outing, and they’re tight and cohesive: for all of the econo ethic of the tour, it’s their hard-earned experience of the musicians that makes them tremendous. As a concert package, it was a great lineup: Hovercraft’s psychedelic shimmer as an amuse-bouche, followed by the explosive energy of the early Foo Fighters, and then the journeyman punk rock stylings of Mr. Watt and his group. The set, as represented here on the live album, was constructed from eight of the 17 songs on the record, along with well-chosen covers of songs by the Minutemen, fIREHOSE, Madonna, Blue Oyster Cult, Daniel Johnston, and others.The 16-song set veers around punk and country and country-punk, as well as flat-out pop (“Piss-Bottle Man,” improbably enough), and it’s tight and well-sequenced and varied in texture, just like a package-tour set needs to be. Watt had fIREHOSE fans and his credentials from his days in Minutemen were unquestionable, but you don’t assemble a roster of high-powered guests for your record to fade into oblivion. Hopefully, a kid who liked the Lemonheads or the Red Hot Chili Peppers, or never got to see Nirvana would come check out the album or the tour, and become a fan of Mike Watt. Or so that was the thought. The songs from Ball-Hog… absolutely hold their own against the rest of the material. “Forever...One Reporter’s Opinion” maintains the urgency of the Minutemen original, Pat Smear on lead vocals sounding like he wrote it himself. “Chinese Firedrill” pulls straight from the Flying Burrito heart of California folk rock with no irony. “E-Ticket Ride” has a jazz-like energy, with both Grohl and Goldsmith on drums, complementing each other seamlessly as though they’d been playing together forever.“Against the ’70s” would end up being the most well-known song from the record, because it was a duet with the then-reclusive Eddie Vedder. Later in the set, Vedder has a solo turn where he breaks out what would become a new Pearl Jam song: “Habit” would see the light of day on 1996’s No Code. Stripped down to essentials and anchored by Watt’s fat, fluid notes, “Habit” feels like it belongs here as much as anything else in the set.The encores are fun: “The Red and the Black” by Blue Oyster Cult, who were kissing cousins on the edge of punk, and an old Watt\\/Minutemen love, becomes a pneumatic drill when in the hands of these guys, with Grohl taking lead guitar. But the real esoteric number is the Madonna cover, a Ciccone Youth special interpretation of “Secret Garden” from Erotica, sung with love and camp by Pat Smear, powered only by Watt and Goldsmith, not that far away from the original arrangement. At their best, live albums capture not just a concert performance, but also document the energy and the context around the music. “ring spiel” tour ’95 manages to accomplish all of the above; it’s a nice time capsule if you were there, and it’s a great document to have if you weren’t, commemorating early years of musicians who are now canonic. At one point, Watt admonishes what were undoubtedly a disproportionate amount of amateur crowd-surfers: “Do you like those people rolling all over your heads?” (The crowd responds with a unanimous “No.”) “Then why don’t we give it a rest. Have to have your old man come up here and act like a fucking cop, to tell you that shit,” Watt says, the disgust obvious in his voice. If nothing else, this tour is a tribute to his instincts as a band leader, and a scene elder. He might have had some trepidation on starting over after ending fIREHOSE, but this record proves that he never should have doubted his instincts onstage.\"],[22395,\"Fingerpicked acoustic guitar is a hit-or-miss proposition: When it works, the rolling, repetitive figures it produces can be hypnotic. But it’s easy for even a great player to drift into auto-pilot. The antidote seems pretty simple—pause, stretch, slow, or otherwise disrupt your habits—but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Muscle memory is hard to kick.In all of his work so far, guitarist Daniel Bachman has avoided the traps of robotic fingerpicking. But on Daniel Bachman—his eighth solo album, and second self-titled one—he does so with a new level of sophistication. It’s his most thoughtful release to date, filled with mindful reflection and confident patience. Even during his snappiest songs, Bachman takes time to consider where he is and where he’s going. When his pace starts to rush, he pulls back, ringing out a long chord or even stopping completely to avoid just going with the flow.The two clearest examples are the tracks that open each side of Daniel Bachman, both called “Brightleaf Blues.” In each, he uses sustained tones rather than flurries of string-picking to build atmosphere. The first half of the album’s opener is a high-pitched drone, followed by gradual strums and plucks that are more about exploration than exposition. Drone is the also backbone of the second “Brightleaf Blues,” humming in the background as Bachman feels his way through open-ended guitar figures. He achieves the same effect without drone in “A Dog Named Pepper,” progressing and retreating at intervals so well-timed they seem elemental, as if his fingers were guided by the moon and the tides.An album of only halting, measured music would likely make Bachman’s thoughtful playing seem flat, so he wisely includes some tunes made in a more traditional early-blues style. The raga-like “The Flower Tree,” the twangy “Wine and Peanuts,” and the chord-bending “Watermelon Slices on a Blue Bordered Plate” all fit this bill well, creating lively swing while still allowing Bachman room to contemplate and reset. Most song titles on Daniel Bachman include images from nature, suggesting this album is environmentally aware—not in the eco-activist sense, but in the sense of Bachman taking stock of his surroundings. He’s almost literally stopping to smell the roses, and the result is an album about growth and development, about the virtues of taking your time rather than the crutch of constantly sprinting forward. In the process, it advances Bachman’s oeuvre significantly.\"],[22592,\"The past few years have been both a bounty and something of an endurance test for Autechre fans. This past May, the duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth released elseq 1-5, over four hours of new material. It earned comparisons to dumping off a bag of clothes at a second hand store and a Netflix show binge. That followed on the heels of last year’s AE_LIVE, which was over nine hours of live shows and 2013’s Exai, which ran for two hours (though still under the length of a modern superhero film). It sounds daunting—and yes, what the duo conjures up sounds daunting—as Autechre is shorthand for a type of difficult strain of electronic music once deemed “intelligent dance music.” There’s a good chance the word “algorithm” will be used when writing about their music, and despite their longevity, they remain at the vanguard, the Cecil Taylors of their field.But for all that impenetrability, there's a lifelong friendship and dialogue that takes place between the two, regardless of the fact they now live in separate cities, building and swapping MAX patches from a distance. It’s a dialogue begun back in the late ‘80s, when they were electro-obsessed teens coming up in Manchester, swapping ideas and tracks on cassette tapes, jamming on analog synths and drum machines in their flats. It’s a dialogue that you can parse on their earliest albums, Incunabula and Amber, finally reissued on vinyl after they’ve changed hands online for three-digit sums. That complex and private language is evident from the start, situating Brown and Booth as the Poto and Cabengo of techno.“Eggshell,” from their 1993 debut Incunabula, subtly reworks “The Egg,” a track from the epochal Artificial Intelligence comp that forever saddled them with the “intelligent dance music” tag . The Incunabula track locates a purgatory between the graffiti-friendly snare and hi-hats and disarmingly gorgeous, slow-moving synth line that evolves almost without notice behind the beat. The landscapes they evoke can seem post-industrial and dystopian, but the chord progression of “Kalpol Introl” still feels melancholic and definitely human. And while its approximately 75-minute length is unwarranted—the acid squelches of “Windwind” exhaust with their 11-minute runtime—there are both time-stamped presets as well as plenty of clues as to their evolution embedded in the album.An early highlight, “Bike,” finds Autechre at their most songful, the bolts-on-concrete sounds of the 808s giving way to a beautiful ambient passage before that metallic beat returns. Even odder is “Basscadet,” a fan-favorite hit of sorts back in 1994. Built from what sounds like a hand drum tattoo and featuring a cheeky vocal sample saying “I don’t have any idea ‘bout what’s going on,” it features the abrasive electronic tones and scoured-metal aesthetic that would soon become the keystone to their future work.Next year’s Amber might most closely resemble Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works 85-92, but even then it shows them subtly begin to slide away from their techno roots. Some of their most ambient tracks are here, though it also finds them favoring darker, more industrial timbres that earned those early Cabaret Voltaire comparisons. It’s still disarming to see them use real words like “Glitch” and “Montreal” rather than the semantic jumble that would soon define their tracks. “Foil” builds with a beat that sounds like a whip against the titular material, the turbid washes decidedly more malicious than on their debut. The synth melodies of “Slip” haven’t aged very well, and the sharper aspects of “Glitch” and “Piezo” feel dulled and gentle in hindsight, knowing just what nasty and brutish sounds they would soon wring out of their gear.What makes Amber fascinating to revisit decades on is to hear vestigial organs and sonic cul-de-sacs that Autechre would bin almost immediately after. Brown would look back and deem these melodic bits “cheesy” but if anything, it proves that at one point the duo was human after all. “Silverside” might be Autechre’s most haunted five minutes, even if the surge of orchestral soundtrack strings and distorted voice are two tricks that we’d never hear again. “Nine” might be the closest they ever got to the placid sounds of new age while “Further,” with its slow heaving minor key swells are as emotive as anything Autechre ever released. The flickering lullaby melody and spare pads of “Yulquen” reveal a soft, contemplative side that few could even identify as an Autechre track.With 1995’s Tri Repetae, Autechre obliterated all that they—and most of their Warp roster mates—had done before. Rather than cut away vestigial parts, they scoured off all flesh and “cheesy” bits entirely, trash-compacted their hard drives and went full cyborg instead. While Aphex Twin used a dentist drill-high frequency to wheeze atop his single “Ventolin” earlier that year, Autechre made it their entire aesthetic, reconfiguring each component of their productions with that same level of sonic intensity. From the deep, sawing sinewave and rockslide of low tones that open “Dael” to the metallic thrums and chilling hiss of closer “Rsdio,” Tri Repetae served as Autechre’s superhero origin story, revealing a monstrous new power while also obliterating any trace of their previous selves. Rather than be able to trace the twisted metal of Tri Repetae to old Detroit techno singles and Mantronik sides, the lineage goes directly to Merzbow’s white-knuckle noise and the hammered metal of Einstürzende Neubauten. They’d push into more experimental and complex music for the next twenty years and never quite be as gentle or linear as those first two efforts.The pewter sleeve bereft of any markings, the images of metal shafts and casings suggest that the humans behind Autechre were replaced not with robots but rather old radiators instead. Since then, experimental and dance artists alike—be they on labels like PAN, Tri Angle or Editions Mego—have absorbed certain aspects of Autechre’s sound. Whether you go for Oneohtrix Point Never, Arca, Holly Herndon, Russell Haswell, or Powell, they inhabit a world that Autechre helped make conceivable, so that even the cold metallic tones of their third album have somehow warmed with time. The bass growl that lurches forth on “Clipper” now feels triumphant rather than menacing, the whinnying frequencies of “Rotar” slowly tease out a melodic line. The spaceship vibrations of “Eutow” bears a low-rider beat at its center and the factory clatter of “Gnit” still reveals something quirky behind all the machinations. Revisiting Tri Repetae twenty-one years later is like returning to a planet previously filled with sulfuric acid clouds, volcanoes and liquid mercury pools. A hostile, post-human sound at the time of its release, it’s now startling to find residents living and thriving there.\"],[22598,\"The highlights from the meticulously recorded 2014 Body\\/Head live set at Big Ears selected for No Waves clock in all together at only 40 minutes, which is exactly the point at which those of us with punk training start to get restless beyond consolation in live settings. No Waves is, in its essence, tenuously and perfectly balanced between experimental challenge and punk efficiency. At first listen, it may seem wild and free; under deep scrutiny, it’s extremely artful, no moment out of place.This should come as little surprise to anyone familiar with either half of Body\\/Head, Bill Nace or Kim Gordon. Nace is an extraordinarily skilled improvisational guitarist who’s collaborated with contemporary greats like Chris Corsano, Jessica Rylan, Mats Gustafsson, Joe McPhee, Paul Flaherty, Bill Orcutt, Okkyung Lee—the list goes on. What remains audible through all of these disparate collaborations is his core skill—as are all titans of improvisation, he is highly adaptable, and above all, an excellent listener. His style is unmistakable, but he never forces his collaborators to bend to it. Instead, he stretches elastic, copper, and rough twine sounds around the structures his collaborators build; it’s magical to observe. Gordon, for her part, has a noted ear for breaking apart pop songcraft; in Sonic Youth, in Free Kitten, and with Body\\/Head, she’s always written bass and guitar lines that are as indelibly catchy as they are inscrutable. There’s always a delightfully missing hinge to what she builds, urging the listener to push open the door instinctively only to watch the entire frame crumble. Of the two shorter tracks, “Sugar Water” and “The Show Is Over,” only the latter has a studio counterpart, while “Abstract\\/Actress” takes two tracks from Body\\/Head’s debut, Coming Apart, and blurs them together into a thick, tense paste. If the versions of these songs on Coming Apart sometimes felt like never-ending spiral staircases from a surreal dreamscape, their mutated live representation paws the ground, less Escher-esque than Baba Yaga’s hut—dream gone nightmare; landscape gone mythic hell. The track takes up the bulk of the album, and yet it never becomes boring and never feels long. There are nods within to no-wave scrawl, to free jazz freakout, to pop hook, and to psychedelic drone. It’s exhilarating.“Sugar Water” is nothing short of beautiful, Nace’s and Gordon’s guitars delicately chiming together, their clangor blending smoothly into a murky dissonance, like church bells. Gordon’s voice twists over the top, wordless, serving as an instrumental tone unto itself, as she has often deployed it. “The Show Is Over” ping-pongs between placid ambience and blown-out, quick-strummed frenzy; Raymond Pettibon’s cover art (far from the gnarly punk line work he’s perhaps best known for, but congruent with his lifelong usage of greens, blues, and yellows, as well as his fat scroll-like brush technique) depicts a seemingly calm lake (the No Waves title, after all, is not just a play on a a genre name), and one may be reminded of that art particularly by this song; how quickly the wind can kick up, how quickly a fresh-water monster could emerge.The dynamism of all three tracks is another of No Waves’ greatest strengths; where Body\\/Head’s studio work is all matte-finished and fascinatingly horizontal, here their interplay stands up in full, palpable relief. The recording retains the crackling live energy and natural ease of the set without sacrificing clarity. No Waves stands as a memorable document on its own and a hopeful harbinger for new material to come.\"],[22628,\"There is a surprising amount of music inspired by particle accelerators. Techno-classical producer Kate Simko wrote an album about the one at Fermilab, located outside her hometown of Chicago. Jazz pianist Al Blatter once improvised along to a “sonification” program that translates data collected by the Large Hadron Collider into music on stage at the Montreux Jazz Festival, where CERN, the multinational research organization that runs the LHC, has held several artist workshops. Sound artist Bill Fontana created a piece that used the LHC itself as an instrument, refracting sound generated by its own data. The LHC and Fermilab have each inspired their own not-particularly-good nerdcore rap anthem, complete with inter-lab beef. So His Name Is Alive isn’t breaking new conceptual ground by taking the LHC as the inspiration for their new album Patterns of Light, but where they’ve taken that influence is entirely uncharted territory. Previous works in strange little niche have crossed multiple genre lines, but there’s always been a consistent aesthetic: clean-lined, blippy, and serene, like what you’d expect to find in a PBS documentary, or what you might imagine a massively powerful and complex piece of technology might listen to for fun. His Name Is Alive mastermind Warren Defever has gone pretty much the exact opposite way, filtering the idea of the LHC through the stonier side of ’70s rock.Defever has spent the past 25 years picking a strange course through a field of genres that up until now has touched on goth, folk, R&B, noise, and chamber pop, but even with all that range, Patterns of Light feels like an outlier. Even if you heard 2014’s Tecuciztecatl, where the band merged shoegazey noise with vintage prog, you’ll still probably be caught off guard when the album opens with a track that–apart from the hypnotic multitrack cooing of vocalist-keyboardist Andrea Morici–sounds exactly like Dio-era Black Sabbath. It’s by far the heaviest, shreddiest, most aggressive thing Defever’s ever done, and, as far as I can tell, entirely unlike any other music ever composed for CERN. The major difference is that past artists seem to have been inspired by the Large Hadron Collider’s earthly manifestation: the sleek lines of its beam-conducting apparatus, its intricate computer arrays, the pixelated action art of its data visualizations. Defever, on the other hand, considers it from a more cosmic perspective, which the LHC offers in abundance. After all, this is a machine that was built in order to rip the veil off the mechanisms of reality, one designed in search of something that’s often been called the “God particle.” It’s so powerful and strange that a lot of people seriously thought that it was going to destroy the universe when it was first powered up. Even after it’s been up and running for years without tearing apart the fabric of reality, people are still terrified of it.Patterns of Light runs on this occult energy. The lyrics—with their frequent invocations of witches, dragons, and the “light of creation”—often read like spells, where knives and sacrificial murder pop up next to dark matter and the standard model of particle physics. “Silver Arc Curving in the Magnetic Field” describes the LHC collider’s 17-mile-circumference circle like the ritual site of a new techno-pagan cult–just the latest iteration in a 3000-year-old tradition of earthworks inscribed into ancient Celtic land. It also helps Defever’s direction in genre-hopping make stronger thematic sense here than on other His Name Is Alive albums. Classic metal and prog—which the band expertly executes on cuts like “Black Wings” and “Demonmix”—have long served as vehicles for high-concept, bong-smacked, “whoa, man” philosophizing. The sunshiney psych-pop of “Calling All Believers” bears a strong resemblance to the Canadian band Klaatu’s new age-y 1976 hit “Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft,” while the pastoral folk of “Dragon Down” sounds like it could have been lifted from a private press LP recorded by a Californian hippie cult. A front-to-back listen through Patterns of Light can feel like a tour through all the places where pop radio and esoteric thought crossed paths during the ’70s, and a tribute to the ways both music and physics strive to explain a universe that can sometimes feel stubbornly unknowable.\"],[22624,\"Over the course of their first four albums, Radian perfected a painterly approach to sound construction. What makes the instrumental Austrian trio exceptional is its ability to wrest seemingly endless possibilities by fine-tuning the grain of every sound. On their fifth album On Dark Silent Off, Radian take the tactile dimension of their music even further while also introducing groove and drama basically for the first time. On Dark Silent Off bristles with a passion that you don't hear on their back catalog. It's not like past Radian records are stiff, but the band always sounded slightly removed as it supplied you with a constant flow of sensory input. This time, they connect with your heart too.  On Dark Silent Off begins much as Radian's other albums do, with two minutes of instrumental textures building into a half-organic, half-synthetic hybrid: electric guitar chords strained through an amplifier, a bleeping electronic pulse, and drum sticks establishing a pattern on snare. As usual for them, the overall tone feels, if not cold, then at least impersonal, an exercise in modernist architecture that privileges audacity of form over comfort. This time, the band relied heavily on transducers to project sounds onto various surfaces, a process not unlike replaying tracks through an amp or studio monitor to increase the feeling of spatial dimension. When new guitarist Martin Siewert plays guitar chords, it feels like you can reach out and touch the grill covering on his amplifier. You can hear air moving behind Siewert and Brandlmayr's array of electronic noises. If the music on On Dark Silent Off had been painted on a canvas, you'd notice the detail in the brush strokes from twenty feet away. But right around the two-minute mark of album opener “Pickup Pickout,” Radian switch into an actual groove, like a post-rock interpretation of a techno banger. Out of nowhere, the music starts to pant, sweat, and move. The sudden rush of humanity is startling. The song ends with a repetitive, pulsing digital loop, and by that point Radian have covered more ground in one piece than they have on some of their entire past albums. In the same vein, a piece like “Recreate Loved Objects” unfolds like a suite, almost a mini-album unto itself, as its somber single-note guitar line traverses a shifting landscape of sounds. Suffice it to say the album doesn’t simply reward repeated listens, it demands them.  Radian's brand of art rock has always gone down surprisingly smooth in whole-album servings, but they've outdone themselves on every level here. More limber and fiery than ever, the band has risen out the experimental cul-de-sac with a riveting work that should appeal to both its expected audience and to new fans who might have otherwise dismissed this style of music as too antiseptic for their liking. \"],[22619,\"Washington, DC exists in a constant ominous haze. It’s no secret that this environment has given rise to absolutely vital punk through grassroots oppositional music scenes, from Dischord post-hardcore forebears like Rites of Spring and Fugazi to the feminist Positive Force collective that fostered the East coast wing of riot grrrl. Sister Polygon, an eclectic record label run by the members of Priests, is helping to set up infrastructure for the latest wave. Their bands deploy many tactics: the confrontational urgency of Downtown Boys and Priests themselves, the tongue-in-cheek minimalism of Sneaks, the giddy polyphonics of Gauche. They all paint sonic critiques of broken systems and create effective models of resistance.Flasher, made up of Taylor Mulitz (bassist in Priests), Emma Baker, and Daniel Saperstein, is the latest to emerge. They take a moody post-punk approach, crafting introspective songs that speak to selfhood and sublimation. “What happens when the continuity of self and the worlds you come to depend on shatter?” Flasher told The Media in April upon releasing their debut self-titled cassette, which is now being re-released on vinyl. “We’re trying to explore new forms of resistance, where being yourself ceases to be a matter of reliability and instead leans into emerging, shifting, and unsustainable senses of self.” The trio’s previous project, Young Trynas, addressed some of these themes on their 2013 EP Probably Music, but on Flasher they’re silkier, more stylized, well-honed.Flasher’s airy melodic vocal hooks, layered over grungy instrumentation, earn comparisons to Goo-era Sonic Youth. The more relentless tracks, meanwhile, like “All Over,” recall the overdriven shoegaze of A Place to Bury Strangers. Call-and-response singing and classically ominous synths round out full, rich songs; each part sits perfectly in the mix. On the standout opener, “Tense,” a languid, taunting lead vocal faces off with another voice, which rattles out a laundry list of concerns: “The backseat\\/The answer\\/To society\\/Something greater\\/The body\\/Distant achievements\\/Further growth\\/Empty gesture.” Crashing waves of guitar nearly drown it out, but the bite of the words is persistent. “Tense” luxuriates in the tension between desire and responsibility.From there, the tracks are more high-octane, built around mantras of being and nothingness. “I’ll erase myself\\/To release myself” vows the chorus of “Erase Myself”; “Is this becoming\\/Or am I succumbing?” asks “Make Out.” The object of immersion is never named; it could be society, or coupling, or the scene. Instead, the focus is on the lure of being consumed, its dark seduction. Closer “Destroy” can be read as a display of sweetly heartsick longing—the chorus crooning, “Starting to realize\\/I just want to be your boy”—or as a self-conscious critique of that form of desire. “Go destroy your feelings,” Mulitz sings, “Make a little room for me.”Across Flasher, dissociative existential questions are countered by the visceral physicality of the songs. This places the trio squarely in the tradition of punk that articulates how politics imprint on the body. “Throw It Away” shakes with every drum kick and guitar screech, recalling the angst of other Polygon projects with the repetition of lines like, “With god as my witness\\/This world is a sickness” and “Why should I be thankful?” But for all the tension and darkness, there’s a real joy to Flasher—a knowing smile, a dream-pop slippage. It’s a fun listen that sounds like it was equally fun to make, which, after all the soul-searching, is a source of relief.\"],[22642,\"Leonard Cohen appeared on seven of his album covers before 1988, always looking cooler and wiser than his listeners: he was the saturnine poet, the seductive man of the world. On the cover of I’m Your Man he looks better than ever, with his sunglasses and impeccable pinstripe suit—except that he’s eating a banana, the slapstick fruit. James Dean would not have looked cool eating a banana. Gandhi would not have looked wise. Cohen’s publicist Sharon Weisz snapped the picture at the video shoot for Jennifer Warnes’ version of “First We Take Manhattan” and thought nothing of it, but Cohen thought it summed up everything the album was saying about himself and the human condition: Just when you think you’ve got it all worked out, life hands you a banana.Cohen was 53 when he released the album that reinvented him musically, vocally, linguistically, temperamentally and philosophically. It quickly became his most successful record since his 1967 debut and many people’s favorite. In Sylvie Simmons’ Cohen biography, also called I’m Your Man, Black Francis says: “Everything that’s sexy about him was extra sexy, anything funny about him extra funny, anything heavy was extra heavy.” Triple-espresso Cohen. Six of these eight songs were career highlights that featured on “The Essential Leonard Cohen” and his 2008 comeback tour. Over the years, they have been consistently covered and quoted and folded into popular culture. Not a bad strike rate for an album that, according to Cohen, “broke down three or four times in the making of it.”Cohen was on his knees when he made I’m Your Man. His 1984 album Various Positions had revitalized his songwriting with his embrace of cheap synthesizers and contained “Hallelujah,” destined to become a modern standard, but it had been rejected by Columbia Records in the U.S. He was running out of money. Songwriting, never easy, had become “hard labor”—he had been struggling with “Anthem” and “Waiting for the Miracle” for years and wouldn’t nail them until his 1992 album The Future. Above (or below) all, he was poleaxed by depression, unable at one stage to get out of bed or answer the phone. He considered retiring and withdrawing to a monastery but he didn’t feel he had the spiritual mettle. He felt that the personality he had sustained for so many years—as an artist, lover, friend—was disintegrating. “My own situation was so disagreeable that most forms of failure hardly touched me,” he said. “That allowed me to take a lot of chances.”Cohen clawed back his self-respect by telling the truth. His account of writing “I Can’t Forget” reminds me of Hemingway’s solution to creative block: “All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.” Originally, the song was about the Jews’ exodus from Egypt but Cohen felt he lacked the religious conviction to sing it. “I couldn’t get the words out of my throat,” he said. So he sat down at the kitchen table, abandoned any pretense to wisdom and began to write one true verse, a twist on Kris Kristofferson’s “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”: “I stumbled out of bed\\/I got ready for the struggle\\/I smoked a cigarette\\/And I tightened up my gut.”The actress Rebecca De Mornay, who began dating Cohen after I’m Your Man, summarized his attitude at the time: “Let’s get down to the truth here. Let’s not kid ourselves.” The truth, as Cohen saw it, was bleak. He had reached the end of a period of spiritual inquiry. His investigations would resume during the ‘90s when he spent years studying with the Zen master Roshi on California’s Mount Baldy, but on I’m Your Man he had reached a conclusion about how the world worked, and it gives the album a wry fatalism. His capacity for action is circumscribed by forces beyond his control. He is chained to music (“Tower of Song”), or a woman (“I’m Your Man”) or the memory of a woman (“Ain’t No Cure for Love”) and there’s nothing he can do about it. Bob Dylan said that with Various Positions Cohen’s songs were becoming like prayers—“Hallelujah,” “If It Be Your Will”—but there are no prayers here, and nobody to answer them.To the extent that I’m Your Man is political—with its allusions to racism, inequality and the Shoah—it is the opposite of protest, because protest is futile here. The bomb has already dropped. The flood has occurred. The plague has arrived. The language of politics or religion or romance has lost its power to console or inspire. All that Cohen can do is describe the blasted terrain without flinching and find a way to inhabit it with some modicum of dignity. “I got some sense that the thing has been destroyed and is lost and that this world doesn’t exist, and this is the shadow of something, this is the fallout, the residue, the dust of some catastrophe, and there’s nothing to grasp onto,” said Cohen, demonstrating his ability to deliver an answer in an interview that’s as finely turned as a poem. The album describes the aftermath—a state beyond pessimism or anxiety or hope. “A pessimist is somebody who is waiting for the rain,” he said. “Me, I’m already wet.”I’m Your Man is the most fun you can have while being told that life is a terrible joke. Because Cohen is a published poet and novelist and a limited musician, his grasp of pop music is often underrated, but he was enough of an entertainer to realize that this lyrical pill would require a lot of sweetening in the studio. The album began to take shape when Jeff Fisher, a keyboardist whom he had met in Montreal, arranged “First We Take Manhattan.” Cohen felt that if these words were couched in “serious Leonard Cohen music,” then they would be intolerable for both him and the listener. The song needed cinematic scope (Fisher’s version reminded him of Ennio Morricone’s work with Sergio Leone) and a beat you could dance to. The synthesizer enabled him to write to rhythms he couldn’t play on the guitar but it also connected him to cities, modernity, the tempo of the street. Fisher’s version, which resembles a militarized Pet Shop Boys, convinced Cohen the album was possible.Then there’s the voice, which had acquired a morbid gravitas ideally suited to delivering hard truths but was not yet a midnight croak. Cohen shows considerable range here, executing each syllable with deadly precision on “First We Take Manhattan”; as intimate as a late-night phone call on the title track; a more ravaged version of his younger self on “Take This Waltz”; jaded and urbane on “Tower of Song.” His backing singers Jennifer Warnes and Anjani Thomas serve as confidants, accomplices, angels and hecklers, encircling that voice like garlands on a statue. Finally, and most importantly, there are jokes. It may be the humor of the gulag or the cancer ward—the black comedy of low expectations—but no less funny for that. “When things get truly desperate,” said Cohen, “you start laughing.”The only man of action on the record, the only optimist, is the deranged narrator of “First We Take Manhattan.” Cohen had become fascinated by extremist rhetoric, from the KKK to Hezbollah, because its “beautiful world of certainty of action” stood in exotic contrast to his own sense that the human condition is defeat and failure. (“Anthem,” which he attempted during the I’m Your Man sessions, would articulate the consolation embedded in his anti-utopian philosophy—“Forget your perfect offering\\/There is a crack in everything\\/That’s how the light gets in”—but not for another four years). The fanatic believes he knows exactly what needs to be done. The fanatic can always get out of bed. Obviously, Cohen didn’t endorse any of these ideologies, so he imagined a movement of one, leaving it unclear whether the narrator is an impotent fantasist or a genuine threat. The understanding of the mindset is chilling but, Cohen reasoned, “I’d rather do that with an appetite for extremism than blow up a bus full of schoolchildren.” Zack Snyder, in a rare instance of good taste and humor, deployed it at the end of Watchmen, where it speaks for the deranged utopianism of Ozymandias.I’m Your Man, which Cohen produced himself, has a reputation as Cohen’s synthesizer album, but each lyric demands a different setting. There’s a country song, a Casio blues number, a waltz, a Quiet Storm ballad and whatever the hell “Jazz Police” thinks it is. A friend of mine calls any near-masterpiece flawed by one outright howler a case of “Jazz Police Syndrome” and it’s hard to disagree, even if you accept Cohen’s intention to make “something quite wild and irresponsible,” inspired by hip-hop and the theme of a Pynchonesque “superagency” that secretly controls the world. Frenzied abandon isn’t one of Cohen’s natural modes, especially when it’s expressed through the medium of slap bass and stumbling drum machines. The joke fails to land.“Jazz Police” is the most extreme manifestation of Cohen’s dedication to the sound and the language of “the street.” He made the album in fragments, in Paris, Montreal and Los Angeles, a city that he felt was “really, truly an apocalyptic landscape.” I’m Your Man is his least spiritual, least poetic, least romantic album. It has no patience for beautiful abstractions. “Ain’t No Cure for Love” (its title inspired by L.A.’s AIDS crisis) and the title track take sentimental clichés—I’m addicted to love, I’ll do anything for love—to brutal extremes. Love is the monkey on his back and he’ll go to any lengths to appease it, even if it means erasing his identity. “I’m Your Man” fades out with Cohen still singing, as if he’s going to keep prostrating himself at the feet of the object of his desire until he gets an answer. There’s a very good chance she’s not listening.Cohen leaves the street just once, diverting all of his poetic energies into “Take This Waltz,” his lush version of Lorca’s 1930 poem “Little Viennese Waltz” that first came out in 1986 on the 50th anniversary of the poet’s death. He said that translating his favorite poet took him 150 hours and a nervous breakdown, which may not be hyperbole because it must have been a mammoth task to honor Lorca’s sinister dreamscape while thoroughly Cohenizing the language. Lorca’s striking image of a forest of dried pigeons becomes “a tree where the doves go to die”; the melancholy hallway becomes “the hallways where love’s never been.” Lorca wrote it during the year he spent in New York, and Cohen’s song retains that dance between the old world and the new as well as the one between love and death.If you had to boil I’m Your Man’s worldview down to just two songs, one would be “Everybody Knows,” a grim litany of human cruelty and injustice with a chorus like a Balkan wake. “It pushes things very, very far just to get a laugh,” he said. It’s been serially abused by posturing self-styled mavericks who miss the humor, from Christian Slater’s character in the 1990 teensploitation flick Pump Up the Volume to conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, but that’s not Cohen’s fault. He doesn’t valorize his cynicism or claim that it requires special insight. Everybody knows this stuff deep down, he’s saying. Let’s not kid ourselves. At a press conference in 2013, Cohen was asked by one earnest journalist what he thought about the state of the world. He paused and smiled and said: “Everybody knows.” Of course.The other keystone is “Tower of Song,” which suggests Beckett’s famous line, “I can’t go on; I’ll go on,” reworked as a stand-up comedy routine. “I was born like this\\/I had no choice\\/I was born with the gift of a golden voice” is the most famous of a string of very good jokes. Cohen laughed when he wrote that line: “a laugh that comes with the release of truth.” Elsewhere, he holds out the possibility that, despite all we’ve been told, things might not be as bad as he imagined: “There’s a mighty judgement coming but I may be wrong\\/You see you hear these funny voices\\/In the Tower of Song.” Even the music is comical, with its rinky-dink keyboard rhythm and faltering one-finger keyboard solo. On his comeback tour it functioned as both light relief and the key to his whole career—he recited the lyric when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. Here, its droll resignation steers the album away from futility at the last moment. This is Cohen climbing out of his depression by accepting his lot as a singer and writer—a lifelong resident in the tower he described as a combination of factory and bordello. Songwriting is how he makes himself useful. It’s not much, but perhaps it is enough. Right up until his death on November 7, at the age of 82, Cohen was a great believer in useful songs. He once told a story about a conversation that helped him summon the conviction to finish the album when he was in a trough of despair. A friend told him that her father, who also suffered from chronic depression, had recently had a dream that made him feel better. It was a dream about Cohen. “I don’t have to worry because Leonard is picking up the stones,” he told her, smiling. I’m Your Man gives the impression that Cohen took this responsibility very seriously. It’s not an uplifting album, but it’s a strangely reassuring one, because you feel that Cohen is working like a dog on the listener’s behalf to make the intolerable tolerable. Leonard is picking up the stones.\"],[22603,\"Over the past four years, Tinashe, a 23-year-old former child actor turned singer, has been nudging the needle of R&B forward with a handful of moody and distinctive projects. Eschewing the glossy production and gospel-influenced, showboating singing style characteristic of traditional R&B, she wove a cocoon, leaning on woozy, atmospheric beats that nodded to chopped-n-screwed culture. Despite her movie-biz background and, yes, camera-ready face, however, she’s struggled to break through in the music industry. In an interview with xoNecole last year, Tinashe explained why she hadn’t been given much support.   “I think it comes from a place of there is only room for one. Or there is only room for two. … There is a Beyoncé, there is a Rihanna, there is Zendaya, there is a Jourdan Dunn. There is a Black girl in all of these positions and we don’t need another one. It’s just kind of ridiculous because there are like a hundred blonde, white actresses and leading ladies. There are a hundred rappers that all virtually look the same, sound the same, and dress the same and no one cares. But for some reason, when it comes to young women … There can’t be room [for us all]. There can’t be five Black girls winning.” There is truth to her response, especially in rap. As more and more promising female rappers pop up, from an industry standpoint there’s still Nicki Minaj and everyone else. But Tinashe’s music also has a somewhat reticent, inaccessible air to it, and her lyrics lack stickiness, which make holding the spotlight hard. Despite her best efforts—the choreographed shows, the sexy cover shoots, the collabs with bigger players like Chris Brown and Nick Jonas—and a warm critical reception (Aquarius, her 2014 debut studio album, ranked on many year-end lists, including Pitchfork’s)—she hasn’t quite become a “star.” She scored a mainstream smash with 2014’s “2 On,” but that might have been a fluke, owing more to the ubiquity of DJ Mustard’s club-ready beats and a stronger POV than Tinashe typically employs in her own slippery vision. Clearly, her team wants Tinashe to be a radio artist (see her addition on a new version of Britney’s sharp “Slumber Party”), but she is making much smarter music than “2 On” or “All Hands on Deck.” In fact, if claiming a spot on heavy rotation playlists is the goal, she might be making music that’s too good, as evinced by her latest project, Nightride.  Delays of Joyride, her upcoming sophomore album, and fuzziness over exactly what Nightride is—a mixtape for sale, a companion piece to Joyride?—hint to her team’s confusion of how to market the excellent yet not-easily-defined music she’s creating. For example, “Energy,” the mystical Mike WiLL Made-It track, is one of the best songs of the year and it didn’t even make the cut here.  Album opener “Lucid Dreaming” is a soothing balm, its wooden chimes evoking the calm of savasana. However, Nightride’s first half is heavily weighted with somber ballads, and the first 25 minutes begin to drag, with the exception of the taut “Company,” which skitters and flits. But from that point on, Nightride sounds fascinating and, while polished, less sleek and cold than the title suggests. It has more of an ominous, broken-down carnival vibe. Tinashe is making some very weird music here (she’s not alone in that, of course—Sevyn Streeter, Dawn Richard, Abra, Kelela immediately spring to mind as her peers). The lopsided, one-wheel-falling-off wonk of “Ride of Your Life” gives way to “Party Favors,” an off-kilter banger that inflates and deflates, swelling with and hissing out helium. And really, considering the country is currently on Mr. Trump’s Wild Ride, shouldn’t the music crafted during it swerve left, taking bumpy, pitch-black back roads instead of paved, well-lit streets?  Generally, production here is drizzly and overcast, and work from newcomer Stephen Spencer (his glitchy-yet-sultry slow-burner “Spacetime” is just begging to soundtrack a futuristic sex scene) to vets like Metro Boomin, Boi-1da, and The-Dream (whose winking “Company” is the lone cloudless song on the project) is excellent and cohesive despite there being almost as many producers as there are songs. Obviously they were inspired by the theme—Tinashe has long preferred shadows and slinkiness to bright poppiness, and Nightride is strictly after-hours music. She even trades her standard breathiness for a richer tone to match the deep groove of “Sunburn.” The listener’s only decision is setting—dim club, deserted freeway, darkened bedroom. The music is infinitely interesting, possibly more so than the artist singing it. But then again, you shouldn’t count out anyone releasing an album like Nightride. As she whispers after “Sacrifices,” “I will not be ignored.” \"],[22594,\"Nominally, The Microcosm is a European sequel to I Am the Center: Private Issue New Age Music in America, 1950-1990, a heavyweight compilation of American new age music curated by Douglas Mcgowan of the California-based Yoga Records and released on Light in the Attic in 2013. But it’s not quite that simple. In ’70s America, cassettes by artists like Steve Halpern and Iasos became surprise best sellers, and new age became an industry, with a mail order network, its own chart—even, from 1987 onward, its own Grammy Award. But while this sort of music—mellow, instrumental, technologically savvy and concerned with matters of the spirit—certainly existed in Europe, it defied such easy categorization. In The Microcosm’s liner notes, McGowan explains how more than one artist featured refused to be involved if the project carried the “new age” tag. Instead, the collection is subtitled Visionary Music Of Continental Europe, and if that sounds vague, McGowan has set himself the task to prove otherwise, drawing lines between disparate musicians who share a belief in something greater, but are resolutely off on their own trip.Whereas I Am the Center surveyed several generations, covering a 40-year window between 1950 and 1990, The Microcosm takes a tighter focus. The earliest of these 16 tracks dates from 1970—birth year of pioneering commercial synths like the ARP 2500 and Minimoog—and the latest from 1986, as analog instruments were being superseded by a new generation of digital music equipment. Some names here will be familiar to those even loosely acquainted with experimental European music of the period. The compilation begins with “Creation Du Monde,” a 1973 track by Vangelis, who would later find global fame scoring Blade Runner and Chariots of Fire, but is featured here having just left the Greek prog rock group Aphrodite’s Child to explore more ambient realms. A serene soundscape made from a Hammond organ treated with tape echo, it found its way to soundtrack Carl Sagan’s Cosmos, and thus to the ears of a generation of American youth open to enlightenment from above.Also present are a number of names typically associated with krautrock—itself a term contested by its creators, but that’s another story. Hans-Joachim Roedelius, formerly of Kluster and Harmonia, is represented by “Wenn Der Südwind Weht,” which sends a blissfully centered melody pirouetting slowly through a soft cumulonimbus of synths. “Brüder Des Schattens—Söhne des Lichts” captures Popol Vuh some years after founder Florian Fricke had abandoned synthesizers as a route to transcendence; instead we hear them crafting a medieval-tinged devotional music with sitar, piano and church choir. Manuel Göttsching’s Ash Ra Tempel were, early on, one of the more fiery and eruptive kraut groups, but “Le Sourire Volé” is in line with the looping experiments of Göttsching’s solo work, guitar and Farfisa organ cast out in shimmering waves. All great stuff, but even when pursuing spiritual ends, the krautrock groups veer towards studious art music, and the most intriguing material on The Microcosm comes from its more obscure, eccentric figures—a cast of mystics, shamans and oddballs who, in their friendly earnestness and paperback spirituality, feel somewhat closer to the American new age fraternity. Some, like Robert Julian Horky or Ariel Kalma, achieve rich soundscapes through homespun means: the former, a longhaired Austrian flautist, achieved his remarkable, pulsating “Dance for a Warrior” by running his instrument through an Eventide Harmonizer; the latter’s “Orguitar Soir” gently layers plucked guitar, droning Farfisa and the sound of birdsong captured in the Borneo rainforest. Others, like Ralph Lundsten or Gigi Masin, pare their music right back, leaving mere wisps of melody and warm tones that glow like embers.Mcgowan’s liner notes are an essential accompaniment to this often abstract music, supplying valuable biographical context. Bernard Xolotl, a French-born synesthete and student of sacred geometry, explains his deeply trippy “Cometary Wailing (Night Plateau)” was recorded during a week of “musical transcendence rites” powered by MDMA. Enno Velthuys, whose “Morning Glory” is one of the compilation’s gentle highlights, is described as a “Dutch Syd Barrett,” a ’60s burnout who whiled away his dotage lost in a private world of psychedelic synth exploration. And there is the German-born musician Georg Deuter, whose “Spirales” is plucked from one of his 60 albums of reiki sound healing, made while resident of Rajneeshpuram, a commune in eastern Oregon founded by the Indian guru Osho. (In a dark twist of a very new-age kind, Rajneeshpuram entered the history books when Osho’s followers contaminated salad bars across Oregon with salmonella, poisoning at least 700 people—the largest biological terrorism attack in US history).In short, good stories. But The Microcosm would stand up without them. New age might be a goldmine, but even a quick survey of the genre demonstrates you need to dig through plenty of fluff to find the good material, and it’s a testament to Mcgowan’s research that nothing here feels hokey or kitschy. If this feels like a slightly less coherent set than I Am the Center, blame the idea of visionary music itself, a category that—by its nature, perhaps—lacks clear boundaries. Still, none of that diminishes the power of the contents. As Robert Julian Horky puts it: “I do my work under any name or label. Time is a River, you know.”\"],[22630,\"Pretty much every project David Pajo has participated in—the pioneering post-rock of Slint and Tortoise, his winding instrumentals and downbeat folk as Papa M and Pajo, the blunt heavy metal of Dead Child—has made a virtue of stylistic consistency. Once you’ve heard the few first notes of a Pajo album, you know what you’re in for, and that commitment to cohesion has always been a strength.All of which makes Highway Songs a risky record. For the first time, Pajo has relaxed his directorial control—“I just would let the songs go on tangents and run wherever they want,” he said recently—and mixed styles rather than picking one. He opens with a lumbering metal jam, switches to an Autechre-like electronic collage, then shifts to soundtrack-worthy guitar accompanied by a sharp drum-machine beat. The rest of the ride on Highway Songs is just as enjoyably bumpy, as contrasting styles continually butt up against each other with little in the way of smoothed-out segues.What makes it all work is Pajo’s patience in constructing a song. Everything here truly unfolds, gradually moving from an initial idea—a riff, a beat, a simple melody—into a multi-layered composition. You can almost hear him working through the tunes as he’s making them, which gives them an intimate feel. Lots of Pajo’s best music—particularly Papa M’s Whatever, Mortal, and his self-titled Pajo LP—bears this kind of private, homemade aura, enhanced by a voice that’s always on the verge of a whisper.In the case of Highway Songs, the music is literally homemade, recorded while Pajo was cooped up in his Los Angeles apartment recovering from a motorcycle accident that almost cost him a leg. It’s been a rough past few years for him: in early 2015 he attempted suicide, which he’s been forthcoming about since. You can hear some of that pain and struggle in Highway Songs—take the somber, cautious strains of the acoustic guitar essay “DLVD”—but it would be unfair to say this album is more emotional than any of his others. He’s always infused his music with a wistful, poignant tone, and he’s still great at that.Besides, Highway Songs ultimately feels hopeful rather than weary, upbeat rather than defeated. There’s optimism in the sunny strums of “Walking On Coronado,” the chugging riffs of “Green Holler,” and the nursery rhyme of closer “Little Girl,” the only song on which Pajo sings. The lyrics are taken from a songbook Pajo found, but they could’ve easily been custom-written for Highway Songs: “Little girl,  teach me to laugh again...to wonder why again.” At this point in his well-travelled career Pajo doesn’t need to learn anything new, but it’s great to hear that he still wants to anyway.\"],[22552,\"Few genres ride the cutting edge as efficiently and boldly as grime. Much like hip-hop, grime’s startlingly adventurous productions have often predicted the shapes and sounds that will bubble up from the underground and into the pop sector. Recent innovations from the likes of Rabit, Logos, Murlo, and Visionist have stretched grime’s boundaries, nudging the genre into ever more surreal and unexpected directions. In 2014, Gobstopper label boss Mr. Mitch and London-based producer Yamaneko further solidified their places among this new wave, with the release of Parallel Memories and Pixel Wave Embrace, respectively. Parallel Memories contained gossamer textures and breathless tracts of negative space. Pixel Wave Embrace was animated by the idyllic moods and vivid colors of meditation tapes and video game soundtracks. Both pointed to a softer, slower, and sparser approach to a genre infamous for its whiplash juxtapositions and hardline tenacity.Over the last year, Mitch and Yamaneko have been working intermittently on a joint project, Yaroze Dream Suite, the results of which are collected in this four-track EP. “There’s a Venn diagram where Parallel Memories and Pixel Wave Embrace meet and a lot of this project came from there,” Yamaneko has said, and for the most part that sentiment holds true. Opener “Pixel Dreams” sets the tone for the EP’s woozy, climate-controlled atmosphere. Built around a strikingly simple melody and spacey, shivering synth tones, the track is the most successful marriage of the two producers’ styles: Mitch’s love for cool, weightless minimalism and Yamaneko’s new age-mining ambience. Plinking chirps, video game sound FX, and trap-like snaps lend the song additional heft, but the outcome remains keenly delicate, dulcet.Closer “Spirit Temple” is similarly jaunty—all skeletal beat programming and melodious synths. Like “Pixel Dreams,” it trades grime’s brute force for restraint, as its arrangements unspool slowly. This scenic take on grime allows the listener to zoom in on each component, drawing out subtle threads and small pockets of emotion that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. “In the Moonlight,” featuring guest vocalist Hannah Mack, flutters with ghostly sirens, prodding synths, and a plaintive sax line; when Mack invites us to “Free your mind\\/‘Cuz everything’s sublime,” it underscores the EP’s central theme. This is grime engineered to float, not punch.Despite the EP’s pillowy silhouettes and beguiling tempos—and several moments of outright bliss—Yaroze Dream Suite often falls prey to its own moderation. Where the duo’s solo releases come across meditative and understated, YDS occasionally scans as mild, and, at times, underdone. No where is this more apparent than on “Awakening,” a brooding cut chiseled from rumbling pads and disembodied vocals; it circles itself a half or so dozen times without going anywhere particularly surprising, or novel. The scope of the EP just feels smaller. Still, YDS remains fascinating throughout, and the question of how its ideas will shape the duo’s future output is enough to strike the interest of any grime diehard.\"],[22625,\"An Odd Entrances arrived fast, even by Thee Oh Sees standards. The Bay Area-born psych band has always worked at a feverish clip—at least an album a year, in additions to shelves of singles, EPs, rarities and miscellany—but their 18th and latest studio full-length follows its predecessor A Weird Exits by a mere three months (for the truly impatient fan, they’d also released a live album just a month before that one). The band has reached the point where their prolificacy has become a kind of performance art, an experiment in how much worthwhile product one group can deliver without releasing an outright dud. Though it’s not a force of nature like the other LPs Thee Oh Sees have produced since returning from their farcically brief 2013 hiatus, Odd Entrances more than keeps their streak alive.  Making the most of the band’s new, double-drummer lineup, A Weird Exits was a concussive dropkick of a record, as focused and ruthlessly efficient as a wood chipper. It didn’t even pause for any of the woozy, psych-pop numbers that frontman John Dwyer usually smuggles onto each record, and now we know why: He was saving them for this one. Recorded during the same sessions, An Odd Entrances is a kinder, gentler companion to its shredding predecessor (“an appendix, if you will,” according to the liner notes), a clearinghouse for all the tangents and detours that would have dulled that record’s fierceness. It’s got riffs—opener “You Will Find It Here” is an absolute beast—but for the most part Entrances doesn’t try to melt your face. It just wants to hang out a bit, maybe split a joint and stare at the sky before calling it an early night.   Three of these six songs are leisurely instrumentals, one of them, “Jammed Exit,” a direct continuation of Exits’ trippiest number, “Jammed Entrance.” The tracks share the same Krautrock groove, except this time a wayward flute scribbles all over it. Like much of Entrances, it feels like a record collector’s in joke—a nod, perhaps, to the Blues Project’s Projections, or maybe some forgotten Nuggets-era deep cut. Other references are less obscure. “The Poem” is pure Magical Mystery Tour, right down its spacey prose and melted-taffy strings, while “At the End, on the Stairs” conjures a Donovan-esque blur of paisley and incense. Then “Nervous Tech (Nah John)” ends the record as it began, with another percolating jam that lets both of the drummers get some.  Much to the exasperation of newcomers looking for a consensus entry point into their endless discography, Thee Oh Sees have been so astonishingly consistent that few of their records tower far above (or for that matter fall far below) any other. An Odd Entrances is the rare effort from the band that clearly announces itself as a lesser work. Even at just half an hour long, it’s so disconnected that it feels more like an odds-and-ends collection than the group’s actual odds and ends compilations. Casual fans can take a guilt-free pass on this one, then, but as always, the group’s insatiable base won’t have any reason to regret placing their pre-orders. If A Weird Exits was Thee Oh Sees’ Thanksgiving feast, An Odd Entrances is Friday’s turkey and stuffing sandwich—hardly a destination meal, but plenty satisfying in its own way.\"],[22618,\"For his first release on Warp, the Italian electronic producer Lorenzo Senni drew on impish visual artist Ed Atkins’ video piece “Ribbons.” If you haven’t had the fuddling pleasure of seeing Atkins’ videos in-person, they involve hyperreal digital animations—usually avatars of himself—as they stumble through video game-like realms, muttering pop songs in bedrooms, airports, pubs, clubs, and other surreal and mundane spaces. Atkins’ sodden protagonists may croon the likes of Elton John and Randy Newman, but his aesthetics match those of Senni. His tracks also revel and find depth in synthetic surfaces, make pop allusions, and simulate the maddening sensations that arise from the digital corporeality of our modern life.Senni finds all the thematic material he needs in one of electronic music’s most maligned genres: trance. His early albums were forays into glitch and ambient, but with trance, Senni sought the ecstatic in isolating that music’s builds and breakdowns. He excludes the elements where most listeners would find pleasure centers of such music, in its bass and drums. Like Heatsick with his Casio and Aphex Twin’s own rabbit hole plunge with the Cheetah MS800, Senni maniacally deploys but one keyboard for all of his sounds, the Roland JP8000. As he told Fact last year, “if I had to approach trance music, I had to have that synthesizer.” Persona is denser than Senni’s previous albums, as the JP8000 is now layered, each bit of space filled with more effects. The result is maximal. The delirious BPM and synth stabs that gush forth on “Win in the Flat World” are cheesy and over-caffeinated, initially bringing to mind the productions of Nozinja and even PC Music. But while the track keeps up its whiplash machinations, slowly little tears form in its synthetic fabric. A curlicue of electric sax appears, the dense chords dissolve, and a single key is left to fidget. “One Life, One Chance” is equally cartoonish, a festival’s-worth of fist-pumping anthems freeze-dried and then shoved into three-minute pop length. A smear of bright brass and color, EP standout “Rave Voyeur” is a dizzying carousel—which makes its fluttering breakdown and subsequent build-up, halfway through, all the more thrilling.Trance may be what Senni references explicitly, but it’s when he lightens his tracks by just a few clicks that the underlying intent and intensity of Persona get teased to the surface. On a less-manic number like “Angel,” Senni wrings a sense of contemplation out of the fast arpeggios. Closer “Forever True” seemingly settles on a breakneck speed, but Senni slams on the brakes and the track turns spare, slow, and hushed. A catchy, if halting, melody emerges, and one can almost imagine a synthesized Atkins avatar awkwardly lurching to it.\"],[22602,\"All the world’s a stage to Elias Bender Rønnenfelt, Iceage frontman and Marching Church mastermind. The Dane was sporting a death mask when we first met him in the early ’10s—a grungy Hamlet, flailing and wailing beneath the house lights. Championed by Matador, his band ascended, and in time, those tragic poses became more polished, less garish—and on 2014’s ambitious Plowing Into the Field of Love, downright romantic. Rønnenfelt attempted to continue Iceage’s momentum after their last album, but his writing failed to open up a clear map for the band’s next steps. Naturally, the musician wrung out his brainstorms into the new Marching Church album instead. This time around, the project’s no longer a solo effort: Rønnenfelt’s formally incorporated his backing band from This World Is Not Enough–a formidable crew featuring members of Lower, Hand of Dust, and others—and his Iceage bandmate Johan S. Weith into the group writ large. Such moves beg the question of overarching intentions, of where Iceage ends and Marching Church begins; despite the confessional undertones of its title, Telling It Like It Is offers little in the way of demarcation–but boy, is there drama.Last year, the Dane visualized his Marching Church as one man’s luxuriant fantasy, plucked from the pages of Dorian Gray (“What I pictured was me in a comfortable armchair, adorned in a golden robe, leading a band while a girl kept pouring me champagne”). This decadence—manifested in moaned tantrums, eye-rolling Swans worship, and directionless, woe-is-me racket—torpedoed This World Is Not Enough, rendering it a slog. Thankfully, Marching Church’s sophomore effort scales back the melodrama and ramps up the discipline: Rønnenfelt and company are focused on verses and choruses and dynamics, rather than self-indulgent noodling—and in the case of this album, a little bit goes a long way. The delirious “Lion’s Den” opens with a far-off subterranean rumble—Kristian Emdal’s loping bass encircles a skittering piano line, while the forlorn melodica squeals–before a brittle, clanging backbeat surfaces, kicking off the hypnotic death march over which Rønnenfelt presides, eyes glinting, lips curled. After he’s lulled us into complacency with an otherworldly falsetto, the chorus hits, his voice deepens into his usual bloodthirsty moan, and dread sets in. “In the lion’s den,” he taunts, as if smelling our fear through the speakers, “They still bite after you\\/They still chase after you\\/Come on in.” Is Rønnenfelt offering an escape from the beasts’ assault, or is he just another big cat  in the big city, peering from behind his disguise? The beauty’s in the liminality: not just on “Lion’s Den,” but in the album’s broader creative approach, which, however formalistically grounded, seeks to blur the lines between human passion and studio precision through copious overdubbing. “We wanted it to sound like a studio and the instruments, as if the studio became a member of the band,” he told CLRVYNT, “We didn't want it to sound like a realistic live band playing.” Indeed, the album’s inherent connections with the uncanny valley, its inquiries into where the band ends and the cavernous surroundings begin, are more effective dramatic vessels than any of Rønnenfelt’s ham-fisted imagery. It’s hard not to stifle a chuckle at his operatic bellows regarding the act of being “fist-fucked by destiny,” or at the blistering chorus on “Heart of Life,” wherein the Dane offers a compelling impression of Nick Cave after a few too many cocktails—“At the heart of life, shoo-gahh!.” On the other hand, the record's overarching dynamics—the existential tug-of-war between the band’s hypnotic krautrock attack, Rønnenfelt’s vengeful yowls, and the studio’s limitless expanses on the glam-but-glum “2016” and the country-tinged “Calenture” (familiar and yet ever-so-off, like a trip to Westworld)–suggest that the musician’s at least partially aware of his own absurdity, and perhaps, that he’s learning how to weaponize it. \"],[22621,\"Matthew McQueen’s Leaving Records is quickly becoming one of the most diverse labels going. His own music swings from hip-hop to ambient, and McQueen has found common ground between those dueling interests, releasing a stream of disparate records ranging from the new age of Laraaji, SunPath, and his own Matthewdavid moniker to unclassifiable records by Guy Blakeslee, Seiho, and Deantoni Parks and a steady stream of off-kilter hip-hop in the mode of Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder imprint. Luz, from L.A. producer Devonwho, is the latest Leaving release to continue the trend, drawing on R&B, funk, and hip-hop.Devonwho (born Devon Fox) is part of the Klipmode collective that includes friends and Leaving labelmates Mndsgn, Knxwledge, and Suzi Analogue, and their vision for hip-hop shares both influences and an ideological point of view, celebrating the synth-driven nostalgia of the early ’80s. Luz is situated in a wobbly aesthetic of Zapp-style synths, with a blunted haze hanging on top of everything.At its best, Luz presents Devonwho as a fresh new voice, with a handful of standout tracks that argue that even today there’s still gold to be found in the g-funk swamps. The moody “Trueandyou” has a pulsing, emotive synth and a stuttering hi-hat beat, and “Andthentherewas” comes off like a lazy brother of “Still D.R.E.,” featuring a similarly plinky melody. Both tracks recognize the value of melody over squelch, and Devonwho drapes a lovely overlay of synths to complete the picture. “Alphaloop,” “Trio,” and “Anti-ragequit” mine a similar vein, with the latter sounding like it could have been the anthem to a different, more Dazed and Confused version of Stranger Things.On two of Luz’s weaker tracks, Devonwho brings in vocalists, perhaps as a way of advertising his production to beat-seeking rappers. As uninspiring as the vocal cuts are, they present a welcome change of pace on a record with a relatively limited palette and a handful of boring snoozes. At a relatively economical 39 minutes, and with 11 of its 13 tracks being instrumentals, Luz amply showcases Devonwho’s chops as a producer. But as a listening experience, it lags well behind this fall’s more consistent and inspired Body Wash from Klipmode compatriot Mndsgn.\"],[22607,\"Since their 1990 debut, People’s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, A Tribe Called Quest have been forward-thinking, presenting their albums as full-length meditations on sound and society. They didn’t break new ground as much as they dug deeper into the lands beneath their feet, turning stones and cultivating fertile soil, unearthing the past and tending the roots, with album-length suites centered around loose conceits—the light diary of Instinctive Travels, the aural dive into drums, bass, and downbeats of 1991’s The Low End Theory, the pan-African flight of 1993’s Midnight Marauders, the dysfunction of hip-hop’s materialism on 1996’s Beats, Rhymes and Life, and the yearning sadness of 1998’s The Love Movement. The latter strived to serve as a healing elixir and balm for what was, up until recently, the swan song for one of the greatest acts that hip-hop has ever produced.Alluded to constantly via rumors and unfounded hopes, a forthcoming Tribe album seemed like wishful thinking for years. Despite the assurances of legendary music executives, fans could not be blamed for being cynical. The group had splintered fabulously, as documented in Michael Rapaport’s unflinching 2011 documentary Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest. Moreover, the death of member Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor earlier this year, seemed to ensure that any future efforts would be full of excavated throwaways and repurposed vocals from other projects made fresh via studio magic. Yet, We got it from Here exists, their sixth (and final) album, and it’s full of unblemished offerings that were recorded at Q-Tip’s home studio following their performance on Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show one year ago. And, against many odds, it’s an album that reinvigorates the group’s enviable discography without resting on the nostalgia of past accomplishment.The album’s first number, “The Space Program,” is quintessential Tribe—it has that sooty bottom heavy warmness, the uncluttered arrangements and bright instrumentation, and it sounds like a piece of 2016 instead of a fragment of 1994. For the first time in their career, the entire group appears to be at their peak, exuding a well-earned effortlessness. Even if Ali Shaheed Muhammad is listed nowhere on the credits, the act’s three MC’s—the abstract Q-Tip, the ruffneck Phife, and the often M.I.A. Jarobi—are on point all the time, picking up each other's couplets and passing microphones like hot potatoes. On “The Space Program,” Jarobi rhymes “We takin’ off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowin’\\/What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not goin’,” before Q-Tip nimbly takes over with “Reputation ain’t glowin’, reparations ain’t flowin’\\/If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowin’.” The song plays with a sci-fi framing—“There ain't no space program for niggas\\/Yo, you stuck here, nigga”—yet it’s not about an imaginary future, but right now. “Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude,” Q-Tip raps, unveiling the entire song as a metaphor for gentrification, perhaps even forecasting the showdown over the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock. And just that quickly, you realize that Tribe—poetical, allegorical, direct, and forever pushing forward from the present—are back as if they never left. The timeliness of this album can’t be understated, nor could it have been predicted. On “We the People…,” Q-Tip breaks out into a mini-song as hook: “All you Black folks, you must go\\/All you Mexicans, you must go\\/And all you poor folks, you must go\\/Muslims and gays, boy we hate your ways\\/So all you bad folk, you must go.” It follows in the pathways of Jamila Woods’ HEAVN and Solange Knowles’ A Seat at the Table as an album that expresses the deeply painful and deep-seated racist attitudes of current America without rancor. That the hook echoes President-elect Donald Trump’s most famous and reductionist campaign views works in ways that it would not had Hillary Clinton garnered enough electoral college votes to win the election. (For comparison, the video for Ty Dolla $ign and Future’s “Campaign,” released the day before the election, seemed to bank on a Clinton victory in its jubilation, but now feels tone deaf.) Ironically, Tribe may have also been seeing a Clinton victory; Q-Tip references a female president on “The Space Program.”A decade and a half ago, while working on his (erroneously shelved, then belatedly released) sophomore album Kamaal the Abstract, Q-Tip was asked about grown men making hip-hop music—he had, after all, just entered his thirties and was still playing at what is largely a young person’s game. He countered that hip-hop was not solely a youth genre; that the media and commercial forces had made it so; that the top MC of the moment—Jay Z—was in his thirties; that the best art comes not from the exuberance of youth, but the mastery of form. We got it from Here proves that he was right. Q-Tip has long been quietly regarded as one of hip-hop’s most thoughtful and inventive producers, and this album is full of accomplished flourishes. On the lascivious “Enough!!,” the vocals of Ms Jck (of undersung alt-R&B progenitors J*Davey) are treated like source material, woven into the musical bed. There are layered, echoing, melodic sonic manipulations and restrained uses of Jack White and Elton John on “Solid Wall of Sound.” On the introspective and confessional “Ego,” White (again) is used sparingly and smartly for subdued electric guitar touches. We got it from Here is not the music of a producer showing off, but of one knowing what to do and when to do it. There is a bevy of guests on this record, but they all serve the project like instruments that come in and out without attempting to take over with solo turns. When “Dis Generation” uses a sample of Musical Youth’s “Pass the Dutchie,” one can see a labyrinth of in-jokes and conceptual easter eggs that extends to the rhymes: Phife prefers cabs to Uber; Jarobi is wizened, smoking on “impeccable grass” and waiting for New York to approve medical marijuana; and Busta Rhymes—who appears multiple times and sounds more at home with his Native Tongues brethren than he ever has with the extended Cash Money bling set or even on his The Abstract and the Dragon mixtape with Q-Tip—is “Bruce Lee-in’ niggas while you niggas UFC.” For his part, Q-Tip shouts out Joey Bada$$, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole as “gatekeepers of flow\\/They are extensions of instinctual soul.” It’s what ATCQ has always been—self-referential without being self-serving, part of the pack but moving at their own pace, and able to lightly and relatedly convey observations that would be heavy and pedantic from just about anyone else.It can’t be said enough how simply good this record sounds and feels. Everyone here shows themselves to be a better rapper than they have ever been before, but that still doesn’t capture the ease and exuberance of it all, how Q-Tip curls flows and words on “The Donald,” how Jarobi surprises with packed strings of rhyme at each turn, how Phife and Busta Rhymes dip effortlessly in and out of Caribbean patois and Black American slanguage. (And that’s not even taking into account Consequence’s inventive word marriages on “Mobius” and “Whateva Will Be,” Kendrick Lamar’s energetic angst on “Conrad Tokyo,” or André 3000’s and Tip’s playful tag team on “Kids…”) The music is decidedly analog, a refutation of polished sheen and maximal perfection; it’s an extension and culmination of ATCQ’s jazz-influenced low-end theory. But that doesn’t capture the bounces, grooves, sexual moans, random bleeps, stuttering drums that float throughout—like every classic Tribe album, it defies simple descriptions.Many of the songs here hearken back to off-kilter and underexposed gems of days past (see: Tribe’s “One Two Shit” with Busta Rhymes and De La Soul’s ATCQ-featuring “Sh.Fe. MC’s” from days past for musical antecedents) without feeling like retreads, the free-wheeling whimsy and experimentation of the past having been replaced a grounded irony and proficiency. So much has stayed the same and yet so much has changed.There’s no overriding story that easily presents itself—no vocal guide a la Midnight Marauders, no driving ethos served on platter like the Low End Theory; the title itself, which lends to an interpretation of this as a project of hubris demanding homage, is never explicitly explained. Even Phife’s death is given due reverence, but isn’t treated as a central theme. We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service is all just beats, rhymes, and life. Nothing about this feels like a legacy cash-in; it feels like a legit A Tribe Called Quest album. We should be the ones thanking them.\"],[22611,\"While working on Speedy Ortiz’s last LP, 2015’s Foil Deer, Sadie Dupuis was emerging from an abusive relationship. But rather than reflecting on the experience, Foil Deer was a concrete decision to grow stronger. “I’m not going to write any songs about this person because they’re a piece of crap who doesn’t deserve my mental energy,” Dupuis told Pitchfork at the time. Slugger seems to be still processing past pain but it takes “Raising the Skate”’s “I’m not bossy, I’m the boss” mentality and multiplies it by 100: what results is a guide to loving oneself, surviving, and supporting others. This empowering attitude should not come as a surprise for any fans of Speedy Ortiz. While touring Foil Deer, the band started a “help hotline” to encourage safety and accountability at their concerts. That same year, they raised money for Girls Rock Camp Foundation through an all-ages tour. But sonically, Slugger is 180 degrees from the scuzzy guitars and tangled wordplay of Speedy; Foreboding simmering is replaced by sparkling keys, dissonance is made danceable, and maybe there’s a keytar in there, who knows. Dupuis wrote and recorded the songs that would form Slugger over a two week period while living in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia. Her original concept was to home-record each song before entering a studio and  allocating each song to a different producer. Luckily, Dupuis avoided what could have been a chaotic collage and decided to produce the album herself, adding an additional layer of autonomy to a record all about positivity, in all caps and probably punctuated with multiple exclamation points.In some ways, Slugger is more accessible than any Speedy release. “I wanted to make songs that were the opposite of ‘Genie in a Bottle’ or ‘The Boy Is Mine,’” Dupuis has said, and Slugger definitely succeeds in this mission. Its messages are loud and clear and little is left unexplained. The downside of this is that sometimes listening to Slugger can feel like being hit over the head. Considering that every two minutes an American is sexually assaulted, this explicitness is perhaps not a bad thing, but there’s a fine line between showing and telling, and Slugger does a lot of the latter. Take lead single “Get a Yes,” a giggling and shimmering number that spells consent out quite plainly: “I say yes if I want to\\/If you want to you’ve gotta get a yes.” This message perhaps seems obvious to anyone listening to Slugger; that doesn’t mean it’s not an important idea to express. “Just a Friend” works in a similar way. “Put to bed your old ideas about my friend Ben,” Dupuis chirps over a swirling sea of blips before demanding, “If you’ve got a girl who says she’s just got a friend, then you should just believe.” The song concludes with the tongue-in-cheek call to “objectify these boys,” an idea that is unfortunately left at the end. “Hype” is a protest regarding labeling and pitting women against each other. “‘Cause I just wanna hype my best friends, man. I just wanna hype my best girls.” Slugger’s transparency raises the question “just what is the album trying to accomplish?” Is it simply offering anthems to an audience who already believes and agrees with these politics? Is there anything wrong with that? The less instructive and more oblique songs on Slugger include “<2” and the infectious “The Sting,” the former of which sounds like it could be a Speedy song. “Krampus (In Love),” which was previously released as a demo, is a holiday jingle that feels applicable and listenable year-round with truly poignant lines and imagery like “If beauty is a terror, will the snow cover the evidence of love as something beautiful?” Closing track “Coming Into Powers” is perhaps the most interesting track, a literal “fuck you pay me” declaration of empowerment. Ithaca, NY rapper Sammus joins Dupuis at the tail-end of the track, offering a welcome change in tone.“Sure, there’s sexiness to mystique, but when it comes down to it, it’s a really dangerous way to interpret what someone wants,” Dupuis told DIY magazine. Seemingly in protest against this mode of thought, Dupuis has left little within Slugger for listeners to unpack. One of Speedy Ortiz’s strengths is that beneath all the instrumental layers, there’s a narrative puzzle to unpack. Sad13’s Slugger solves its puzzle for you, but in the hope that you will be able to go at it alone in the future.\"],[22616,\"Jacques Gaspard Biberkopf makes music for turbulent times. A Lithuanian producer with roots in Berlin’s club underground, his music—a liquid, digital audio collage of distressed electronics and manipulated field recordings—suits a world buffeted by technological disruption and tidal waves of capital. It isn’t dance music, exactly—too abstract, too spacious. But Biberkopf works with the club in mind, such spaces being, as he told FACT, “a total, immersive environment, rather than a stage with a predefined fourth wall.” Like, say, Hyperdub boss Kode9 or the Turner Prize winner Mark Leckey, Biberkopf straddles the worlds of dance music, art practice and academic theory, in search of something profound or meaningful to say about the times in which we live.Ecologies II: Ecosystems of Excess is a sequel to his 2015 EP Ecologies, and continues with many of its themes. This is a sort of speculative fiction in sound, dealing with the dawning of the Anthropocene, defined by scholars as the epoch of humankind: one of mass extinction, climate change, deforestation, oceans choked with plastic. Biberkopf is into collapsing boundaries—between the real and the virtual, the organic and synthetic, the gallery and the club. At times, Ecosystems Of Excess gestures towards dance music: see the pulsating trance synths that cut through “Transfiguration I: Enlightenment”; or “New World Order,” with its thudding, pressurized beats and flicking halogen hats. Elsewhere, it feels like a 2016 update of music concrete, as pioneered by figures like Bernard Parmegiani or Pierre Schaeffer. Processed electronics intermingle with heavily treated field recordings, tracks stretch out into protracted drones or twitch with sudden jump-cuts, and everything collapses into texture.The influence of critical theory and contemporary art runs throughout the record. The titles here—“Technocracy”, “Wetware”, “Eruption Of The Amorphous”—gesture to sci-fi and cyberpunk, or resemble chapter headings plucked from an ambitious philosophy Ph.D dissertation. The LP, meanwhile comes packaged with an art book by the design studio Maximage, in which surreal landscapes are overlaid with an essay by the writer Deforrest Brown Jr. that blurs the edges between academic theory and avant-garde poetry.This aesthetic is echoed in the music, which appears to resist clear interpretation. On “Eruption of the Amorphous,” voice software recites hollow platitudes. In the depths of “From Infinity To Here,” you can discern snatches of narrative—the splash of water, the rattle of a subway car, distant sobbing—but try to piece it together and you end up lost. The best moments here are those that set out to fool the ear. “Preacher” samples an African-American minister and makes him sound like a vein-popping MC of the Def Jux school. “Realer Than Real,” meanwhile, employs that common trope of 21st Century club music: the crack of gunshots. In a moment of pleasing absurdity, though, it chooses to blend it with the sound of panicking geese and cocktail jazz piano.Like recent records by Rabit and the Haxan Cloak, Ecosystems of Excess feels very tactile: you feel it as much as hear it. But its tone of high academic seriousness is something of a stumbling block. An artist like Holly Herndon works with similar conceptual ideas, but makes them feel like a playground, not a lecture. Ecosystems of Excess can be formally daring and grimly thrilling in its bold, dystopian vision. But it can feel rather enervating, inducing a sense of paralysis and alienation. Right now, just a glimpse of the way forward would be very welcome.\"],[22617,\"Ever since the cartoonish screaming face of In the Court of the Crimson King, progressive rock has often felt like a mirror to the mind at its most active and untamable, transmitting feelings of anxiety through complex, intricate compositions. The genre has also always been an outlet for some of rock’s most capable musicians to put their skills to good use, though sometimes (especially with the help of sterile modern-day studio production) to the point of impenetrability. After debuting in 2009 as the solo project of Nigerian-American eight-string guitar wizard Tosin Abasi, Animals As Leaders have walked the tightrope between sheer technical virtuosity and actual emotional resonance, occasionally with thrilling results. Each of their previous three records has presented a tighter and more focussed band, as Abasi’s introduced a wide range of styles, from jazz to djent, into his band’s arsenal. The resulting music—a dense and triumphant brand of instrumental metal, with Abasi’s arpeggiated soloing always at the center—rewards close listening. It can be dazzling or exhausting, depending on your mood.Drummer Matt Garstka has called the band’s latest album, The Madness of Many, “the most natural-sounding Animals As Leaders album yet,” which seems like a bit like a paradox. There are a few moments on the record when you can see what he might have meant, like the intimate guitar solos that close out “Inner Assassins” or the (relatively) straightforward jazz fusion of “Private Visions of the World.” But, as always, the primary appeal of Animals As Leaders is just how unnatural they sound. Like any of their previous albums, Madness of Many includes no chaotic feedback squeals, no casual studio banter, no shouted count-offs to four (or to sixteen-and-three-eights, or what-have-you). The production is as clean and glossy as ever, and the band’s M.O. remains scoring dystopian cyborg fights on a burning planet as shooting stars explode in the background. Of course, they sound great doing it. More than any Animals As Leaders record yet, this one feels like the band settling into their skills, simply playing off each other as opposed to pushing themselves to new heights.Rather than “natural,” a more apt descriptor for Madness of Many might be Animals as Leaders’ most comfortable sounding album yet. Madness is a spacious and satisfying record: what it lacks in standout moments, it makes up for in coherence. Its ten tracks, all hovering around the five-minute mark, mostly steer clear of the band’s patented everything-at-once assault, favoring a slower burn. Few of these tracks feel like entirely new territory for the band, with Abasi returning to familiar tones and patterns and each song skittering around similar tempos. The moments that do feel new, like the lurching electronic raga of album opener “Arithmophobia,” are a welcome introduction of new texture into the occasionally monotonous mix of guttural guitars and synth.The album’s most daring section is its finale– the meditative sprawl of “The Brain Dance” and “Apeirophobia.” It’s not surprising to hear that Abasi is as inventive with acoustic guitar tones as he is with electric, but it’s a relief to hear him switch it up by the album’s end. “The Brain Dance” takes influence from both Latin guitar and Appalachian folk, with an ominous backdrop of reverb, while “Apeirophobia” is the album’s sparsest piece, layering guitars into a tranquil choir of strings. Both songs find Abasi stepping back from his frantic pace to take a breath, to maybe even enjoy himself. The title of Animals As Leaders’ previous album, The Joy of Motion, referred to Abasi, a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation, noticing how quickly his hands moved as he played guitar. On these two songs, he seems more content to let us bask in the joy of taking a break from all the noise.\"],[22401,\"For a long time, the only thing there was to know about the gospel singer Washington Phillips is that there wasn’t much to know. Born in Texas in 1880, Phillips recorded a total of 18 songs between 1927 and 1929. Two of these songs were lost. The remaining 16—light, dreamy, paranormally gorgeous—were issued two at a time on 78-r.p.m. records, the precursor to the modern LP, then trickled out on vaguely anthropological collections like Negro Religious Music Vol. 2 or Screening the Blues. It wasn’t until 1980 that Phillips’ was given his own dedicated release, and then on a small label run by a high school English teacher in the Netherlands.Until now—and this is invariably the heart of Phillips’ story, at least as it’s usually told—people couldn’t even agree on what instrument Phillips used to accompany himself. Some said it was a zither, a narrow stringed box about the size of a laptop. Others said it was an obscure keyboard called a dolceola, in part on account of the Columbia Records’ scout (and Phillips’ producer) Frank B. Walker, who referred to it as a “dulceola.” In the early 1980s, a researcher at Tulane University named Lynn Abbott found a picture of Phillips in the Louisiana Weekly holding what looked like two zithers Frankensteined together, confirming only that whatever it was Phillips played, nobody had seen it before or since. In any case, this is what it sounds like: a small music box playing in a large, resonant cave, playful but indistinct, like dandelion fuzz loosed on a spring breeze.Recent research by the tireless Phillips chronicler Michael Corcoran reveals that Phillips called his instrument the Manzarene, giving rise to the title of a new digitally released collection from the Georgia label Dust-to-Digital called Washington Phillips and His Manzarene Dreams. As mentioned, there are only 16 known Phillips recordings in existence. Though remastered here, they have been released a few times before, including on a still-available Yazoo Records compilation called The Key to the Kingdom. (One version of Phillips’ songs, an LP by the Oregon label Mississippi Records, has a cover obstinately depicting Phillips sitting at a dolceola. Some myths are too beautiful to let go.)What I personally find remarkable about Phillips’ music is how gentle it is. Here is the American servant of a Christian God who never shouts, never growls, never beats his breast or stomps his feet to prove just how strong the spirit is within him. If early rock-and-roll borrowed the hysterics of gospel and turned them into an expression of sex, Phillips’ delivery—measured, conversational, disinterested in the Buddhist sense—is something I hear in ambient and new age music, or in the transcendent reticence of a songwriter like Bill Callahan, who appears to touch God not by reaching out but leaning back. My favorite song here is “What Are They Doing in Heaven Today” because it sounds like he really doesn’t know. My second-favorite is “Take Your Burden to the Lord and Leave It There” because it sounds like he has. No other gospel musician has come as close to convincing me that Jesus’ love might not stress me out.Ninety years on, with decades of exhumations of gospel and blues behind us, Phillips is still an anomaly. The same 1927 trip during which Frank B. Walker first recorded Phillips, he also recorded Blind Willie Johnson, the Dallas String Band, Lillian Glinn and a handful of other artists who sound more or less like musicians playing music in the 1920s. Even Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground),” an unprecedented recording that appears to capture a ghost crying inside a milk bottle, sounds like the Platonic ideal of a style that has become familiar. Phillips’ music remains weirdly without lineage or context, a sound unto itself.The blues is built on apocrypha and myth. It cannot be conveniently subjected to the demystifying rigor modern standards demand without being somehow denuded. You cannot – and maybe, to some extent, should not – fact-check the blues. And yet being black music made during the era of American slavery, institutional and beyond, it seems right as a matter of moral, even reparational course to read the stories of people like Phillips—a free black man who lived on acreage his father, uncles and grandfather bought after emancipation, and spent his Juneteenths slow-cooking a hog on the nearby church picnic green—as fully and precisely as possible.Phillips did not, as it had often been reported, die in an insane asylum, but after falling down a flight of stairs in a government building in Teague, Texas. You can see a picture of this staircase in the liner notes for Washington Phillips and His Manzarene Dreams. It is narrow and wooden and takes a sharp bend to the left about ten steps down. As ambivalent as I am about the mystery of his instrument being “solved” – and as insistently as I feel that explaining what he made his music with will never bring us any closer to the wonder of how – I am startled by the sight of these stairs: So tactile, so ordinary. The greatest mystery (of course) is that Phillips made this all on Earth.\"],[22394,\"This summer, Dedekind Cut—the artist born Fred Warmsley, formerly known as Lee Bannon—began aggregating songs in a Spotify playlist titled “Ambient Essentials.” It’s an eclectic and personal collection of favorites within that wide-ranging umbrella: Julianna Barwick’s calm vocal loops, metallic harmonies by Autechre and Oneohtrix Point Never, Laraaji’s glimmering New Age. Warmsley gives the impression of a dedicated listener; this mix felt less like a toolbox than a window into some music he’s used to make sense of the world.As the prolific Warmsley has accumulated releases under his various monikers, his relationship with genre has shifted. He got his start producing instrumentals for Joey Bada$$ and the Pro Era crew, serving as their touring DJ in 2012. His output has since progressed from industrial beat-driven instrumentals to blistering jungle and techno, most recently landing in an eerie, arrhythmic place. Since adopting the moniker Dedekind Cut last year, Warmsley has put out three EPs, most recently the cassette American Zen, which comprised four tracks’ worth of even-keeled, dread-tinged drone. On $uccessor, his first Dedekind full-length, this sound emerges notably more grandiose, and more sinister. Leading up to the album’s release, Warmsley tweeted: “The parts you find ugly, uncomfortable, and nasty about [my] work as the Dedekind Cut will surely become its signature.”Though “ugly” may be an overstatement, $uccessor is marked by the productive discomfort that accompanies such unabashed intensity. Whereas American Zen maintained a temperate pace, $uccessor isn’t afraid to crescendo or screech to a halt. This isn’t background music; it’s cinematic, full of movement. Most of all, it’s cavernous. The gently lapping, William Basinski-esque tones of opener “Descend from now” are swallowed 90 seconds in by strings and oceanic tape hiss. This gives way to “Instinct,” in which a fuzzy rhythm, layered beneath a pretty synth melody, builds to an urgent gallop. As Warmsley blends flat, chilly digital tones and analogue elements (including a field recording of birdsong), the disjuncture further pries open this sometimes uncomfortably vast sonic landscape. Warmsley deftly bridges his influences, braiding liquid futurism into the textural warmth of disintegrating tape loops.There are moments when Warmsley loosens his compositional grip; tracks like “Fear in reverse” and “5ucc3550r” meander a bit, crackling and heaving without the insistence that characterizes much the rest of this release. But these slips into plotless quiet are among $uccessor’s most unsettling and purposeful moments. One review of March’s American Zen lamented that listeners “never find out what it’s trying to tell us”; asking Dedekind Cut to explain, however, seems a fundamental misunderstanding of the project’s vocabulary. A record can, of course, have a worldview without providing talking points. $uccessor is undergirded by blackness: it was co-released by NON, the Chino Amobi-helmed collective of artists from Africa and its diaspora; its cover is Deana Lawson’s striking 2014 photograph Cowboys, of two young black men in jeans and chaps atop horses startled by the camera’s flash. As Dedekind Cut, Warmsley makes use of ambient tropes, but this album’s stakes are set far outside the boundaries of that genre. (In spirit and in sound, he’s perhaps better matched alongside his collaborators here, which include the protean likes of Amobi, Angel-Ho, and serpentwithfeet.) If ambient music—so often treated as a somehow ideologically neutral form, its canon overwhelmingly white, Western, and male—can be described as an atmospheric entity, it’s then deployed here to new, ambitious ends. Warmsley’s work is shot through with the violence, anxiety, and fracture that pervade our atmosphere today. But on tracks like the stunning “46:50,” which features muffled vocals from Active Child, an elegiac softness also reaches out to the listener, offering solace. Warmsley has offered a remarkably expansive example of what these pliable forms can do. He seems winkingly aware, also, of the loaded nature of invoking a vast frontier. At a performance of $uccessor at New York’s Issue Project Room in October, old-school country music blasted as Warmsley walked onto the fog-filled stage, a curious counterpoint to the textural drone that followed. This, alongside Lawson’s Cowboys, points to a canny appropriation of the frontier narratives that have, I’d posit, quietly served as scaffolding for much of the Western experimental music canon. $uccessor marks a taking of the reins, so to speak, a direction that will hopefully continue to propel Dedekind Cut.\"],[22457,\"The founders of Cologne’s Kompakt label have grown into their established characters: The silver-haired co-founder Wolfgang Voigt is the stern but affectionate paterfamilias. Reinhard Voigt, his younger brother, will forever be the excitable teen. Superpitcher, with his scarves and propensity for torch songs, is the dandy with Romantic leanings, prone to locking himself in his room with a copy of Baudelaire. Michael Mayer, on the other hand, has always seemed like the sociable, comparatively well-adjusted one—outgoing, generous (he specializes in marathon sets of eight hours or more), sensitive, fundamentally upbeat, plays well with others. The good son, in other words, the golden boy. He has never been the most prolific artist—&, released on the long-running electronic clearing-house !K7, is only his third solo album in 13 years—but his easy charm offers a crucial counterbalance to the more difficult tendencies of Kompakt, the label he co-founded. While Wolfgang Voigt has sampled Kafka audiobooks and foraged glumly through the German Wald, Mayer specializes in self-evident anthems like “Good Times” and the no-frills “Speaker” (with its so-brainless-it’s-brilliant refrain, “I am your speaker\\/Speaker, speaking to you\\/I am not talking\\/I’m speaking, speaking to you”). Above all, he has endeavored to remind techno fans of the centrality of pop and disco, even at the humorless height of the minimal techno craze.I don’t think it’s any coincidence that while many producers thrive on solitude, Mayer tends to draw his energy from other people. It’s part of what makes him such a sharp DJ and such a talented producer of euphoric, good-natured fare. Much of his earliest work was collaborative. He, Reinhard Voigt, and Tobias Thomas used to record as Forever Sweet, while he and Thomas comprised the short-lived Friends Experiment. In 2007, after a considerable spell in which it seemed he’d never get around to following up his debut LP, Touch, he and Superpitcher teamed up for the gonzo, not entirely satisfying SuperMayer project. His new album translates that round-robin approach to the studio, as Mayer teams up with a different artist on every song.The album plays to his strengths. It is more playful than his last LP, and also more finessed. The opening “We Like to Party,” a collaboration with Roman Flügel, is among the best things he’s  produced. Goofy name notwithstanding, the track offers the perfect blend of over-the-top thrills and subtle details. This is the kind of craftsmanship that doesn’t show its hand: A funny little ersatz sax riff goes sailing over artfully layered percussion that fills up every available space without ever feeling cluttered. There are snippets of vinyl scratching and crowd-stoking shouts reminiscent of hip-house’s heyday. It is joyous, faintly ridiculous, and versatile: It would work wonders on a festival stage, but it’s clearly made with 200-capacity rooms in mind, for parties where everyone knows everyone else and the floor is sticky with prosecco.The rest of the album follows in similar fashion. “Disco Dancers,” a reunion with core labelmates Jörg Burger and Wolfgang and Reinhard Voigt, balances loose-limbed, good-times disco with a gently unhinged clarinet solo in the psychedelic breakdown. “State of the Nation,” with the trance-leaning Brazilian producer Gui Boratto, tips into the latter musician’s rich, creamy chord progressions with a delirious grin; if you could bronze a sunset, it’d appear something like this. “Gemination,” with Kompakt labelmate Kölsch, does an admirable job of translating Depeche Mode’s sweeping dramatic gestures via punchy, precision-engineered techno. (If “We Like to Party” is aimed at small rooms, this one’s meant to be supersized.) And the Agoria collaboration “Blackbird Has Spoken” might top them all. The chord progression feels simple at first—just sumptuous strings, slathered on liberally. But the longer you listen, the more it feels like a riddle, in which ascending and descending voices leave you twisting in midair. It’s ecstatic and not a little dizzying, like the feeling of coming up on a drug, but it’s also comforting. You want to stay inside it and linger. As new harmonies keep piling up, the sense of physicality intensifies, like a dream of running underwater.Sometimes the craftsmanship outstrips the expression. “Voyage Interieur,” a throwback electro jam featuring Miss Kittin, is a note-perfect period piece, but its cool is so studied you find yourself checking for a pulse. At the same time, even though Joe Goddard’s voice is full of quirk and character, it isn’t quite enough to make his song interesting. “Comfort Me,” a Prins Thomas co-production featuring husky vocals from Irene Kalisvaart, aims for Fleetwood Mac, but from the Spanish guitar to the vocal harmonies, it’s an uphill slog. And while the Hauschka collaboration, a freestyle\\/chamber-music fusion, is clever enough—Fairlight orchestra hits meet actual orchestra—it doesn’t feel as necessary as the album’s best material.Mayer is far better working alongside Barnt on “Und Da Stehen Fremde Menschen” (“And There Stand Strangers”), which folds a folky sample of what sounds like a German Nick Drake into a tough, moody swirl. Dissonant organs mash and hits of helium tilt toward the stratosphere, but the crisp beat never falters and the doleful vocals keep us grounded. It goes to the crux of what Mayer does best, balancing a strict, buttoned-up groove with the faintest hint of mischief.\"],[22501,\"Contemporary classical music and remix culture have not always been natural partners. Remix albums dedicated to pieces by Steve Reich or Philip Glass often sound more dutiful than imaginative—despite the fact that the minimalist school of composition has inspired countless approaches to electronic music. It's proved a tough problem to solve, yet the attractive idea of placing beat-oriented classical works in the hands of cutting-edge producers generally ensures that new proposals will be forthcoming.  Timber Remixed is the latest entrant in this field. It carries some familiar drawbacks, but also some ingenious stretches. On this double-album set, the work under electronic re-consideration is a percussion piece by veteran composer Michael Gordon. A co-founder of the influential Bang On A Can collective, Gordon’s approach to polyrhythmic complexity led the minimalist movement into some new territory, starting in the 1980s. His 2009 work Timber requires six percussionists to navigate a wide array of patterns, while each playing only a single simantra—otherwise known as a 2x4. (Their varied lengths can produce different pitches and overtones, a possibility first exploited by composer Iannis Xenakis.)Still, boards are boards. And the limited instrumental range of a “wood plank ensemble” might suggest a static experience. Unless the composition itself is really something. The consistent feel of discovery that is evident on the 2011 premiere recording of Timber is due to Gordon’s talent for upending expectations. Rich and bizarre tapestries spring up all over the nearly hour-long piece. Pointedly, Gordon’s beat layers don’t build up in a process-oriented way that might help you anticipate what’s coming next. Rhythmically, Timber is a work of jagged surprise—even when this quality is masked by the surface simplicity of the wood-struck tones.The original release of Timber was performed by the Dutch group Slagwerk Den Haag. Timber Remixed offers two different recordings by the American group Mantra Percussion. On the first disc, a studio recording by Mantra is remixed by twelve different electronic artists. This coterie includes names that are well-known outside the field of new-classical—like Fennesz and Oneohtrix Point Never—as well as underground luminaries like Ikue Mori. The second disc of Timber Remixed presents a complete, live performance of the original piece.It’s a smart move to append a full performance of Timber to the remixes. In this way, the relative star power of Tim Hecker will guarantee that people actually check out Gordon’s music. Though while it is ably played, the live version here isn’t quite on the level of the first release—which to my ears still sounds like the the best vehicle for the composer’s designs. The live take on Timber Remixed features more sustain, and more bass-heavy pulsation. These qualities serve the composition’s most propulsive passages well. But they also rob Timber of some textural variance. (The original take by Slagwerk Den Haag has a drier sound that makes the piece’s eccentricities stand out better.) As a result, Timber Remixed is defined more clearly by its remixes. Tim Hecker’s rethink has been billed as a reference to Steve Reich’s “phasing” compositions. And his piece does sound like Gordon as imagined by Reich, circa 1967. But by reaching back to a period of minimalism before Gordon’s ascent, this remix ignores some of what makes the composer’s music distinct. Jóhann Jóhannsson’s leadoff track has a light-touch approach that involves stretching a few drones atop Mantra’s studio playing. It’s an attractive sound, but you’d be just as well served to listen to Gordon’s music straight up.Composer Sam Pluta’s take, which follows next, shows how much can be gained by discarding the central, wood-tone nature of Timber. After starting out with the collective sound of the simantras, Pluta transmutes and twists the percussion notes into purely electronic washes of sound that still retain Gordon’s melodic patterns. After this feat of filtering out the percussion from a percussion piece and keeping it recognizable, Pluta adds crackling beats back to the mix, for a bit, before closing with harmonics that hit like amplifier feedback.Other acts with audacious approaches to this assignment include Oneohtrix Point Never and Deerhoof’s Greg Saunier. The former blends in synthesized choral accompaniment; the latter fosters a madcap flow by isolating samples and pushing them to extremes of timbre and tempo. HPrizm’s remix uses quick dynamic shifts to create an unstable, foreboding environment.Some of the final entries move so far away from the source material that you’d be hard pressed to identify them as Gordon remixes in a sonic lineup. (That’s the case with Hauschka’s entry, which goes heavy on the prepared-piano.) Driving too far afield from all the elements of Timber can seem as unrewarding a choice as expressing undue fidelity to the piece. Though thanks to the most creative works on the first disc, this crossover project still shows that it's able to do justice to Gordon’s work, while also suggesting some promising avenues for future, cross-genre collaboration.\"],[22612,\"Exactly halfway through MC4, “Lockjaw” hits, and you start to think of French Montana as a rap star. Kodak Black, the preternaturally talented teenager from South Florida, does lots of the heavy lifting, but the song is too potent to simply be the product of good A&R work, or lucky proximity. In just over a decade of work, French has gone from hanger-on to something more vital and far more interesting; on this February’s superb Wave Gods, he reimagined the world at large as an extension of his knottiest late-‘00s mixtapes. It had all the stunt casting you’d expect from a rapper of French’s social stature, but it was a genre experiment. MC4 was supposed to be the capital-A album to solidify him as a mainstream force.Instead, an August release date came and went, the record pushed back for “sample clearance issues” that were later unmasked as low pre-order numbers. All this despite a Drake-assisted single (“No Shopping”), a cameo on Fat Joe and Remy Ma’s colossal “All the Way Up,” and despite “Lockjaw” entering the stratosphere. Three months later, it surfaced on the internet with little ceremony and even less promotion.Where are all the French Montana fans? There’s a chance that the anemic promo run kept MC4 from cutting through the election-year din, that French Montana album cuts never make it to the right years. But his debut album, 2013’s Excuse My French, flopped painfully despite an eye-popping guest lineup and a genuine hit. It also wasn’t his best showing: it had little of the woozy imagination he’d shown in the half-decade prior, and he hadn’t yet learned how to translate those interesting threads to a bigger stage.MC4 falls short of Wave Gods, but is a leaps-and-bounds improvement over Excuse My French. That it doesn’t appear to be the commercial breakthrough he needs is not the problem, per se—the thing that hampers the record at points is the impulse to shoot for a middle and shore up the base. The Miguel-assisted “Xplicit” crosses itself up from the jump, trying to marry a sleepy sex jam to something more Gothic and getting lost on the way. “Play Yaself” is closer to French’s wheelhouse, but the vocals and his writing are more or less anonymous. And even with best intentions, “Check Come” ends up less experimental than it is malformed.But the highs are a joy. “Brick Road” catches French in not one, but two of his best roles: somber-but-still-witty formalist on the front half, Autotune-guzzling serpent on the hook and on the back end. “2 Times” is an update on the Coke Wave DNA; “I’m Heated” is a bizarre and nearly-brilliant blend of Gotham rap styles from the Giuliani and Dinkins eras. “No Shopping” is an obvious hit that holds onto a bit of menace. “Have Mercy” enlists Jadakiss, Styles P, and Beanie Sigel for a preposterously fun posse cut that—thankfully—sounds distinctly like a French song. When MC4 succeeds, it does so like a bulk of his best work: with minor keys and big beats that let some air seep into the crevices.MC4 does struggle to develop an atmosphere of its own; “Lockjaw” and the Kanye- and Nas-featuring “Figure It Out,” both holdovers from Wave Gods, are two of the three strongest songs. So maybe the (mostly arbitrary) “mixtape” distinction will serve the record well, allowing it to live as a loose collection of component parts. It’s not going to build the sort of fervent fan bases that his collaborators enjoy, but it should remind his core audience of why he’s been able to survive a couple of sea changes in rap.And then there’s “Max & Chinx \\/ Paid For.” The first half of the nine-minute, two-part closer is interspersed by phone calls from Max B and by a prayer that French shares with Max’s mother. French raps about Max’s son, about praying for mercy from God and from circuit court judges, about the 75-year-sentence that hung over Max’s head for years of incarceration. Max’s verse on the second half, “Paid For,” was one of the last he recorded before reporting to serve his sentence; Max’s engineer played it for French for the first time just last year. It’s followed by a turn from Chinx, who was murdered in 2015. French invokes Stack Bundles’s name—another fallen friend. He raps about depression, about bouts of insomnia and impromptu mosque visits. If the sorrow is tempered by anything, it’s Max’s voice:“You're blessed, you know I'm saying? And all you gotta do when you feel like that: Look at my situation. You know I'm saying? Think of my situation, n*gga.”  \"],[22525,\"For those who think of Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia and lyricist Robert Hunter as major figures in American music, the Hart Valley Drifters’ Folk Time is a monumental discovery. Recorded in 1962, Folk Time is Garcia’s only known surviving studio recording from his banjo days before attaining electricity a few years later. The future Dead guitarist is clearly the quintet’s leader, or at least most charismatic, and the primary singing voice through most of the 17-song session, with the group’s vocal trio also including Robert Hunter on upright bass and future New Riders of the Purple Sage founder David Nelson on guitar. Folk Time captures three lifelong collaborators during their invaluable time exploring the roots of American music before making their own. Though the front cover portrait of Garcia as an itinerant young Mumford with suspenders and bed-roll might read as a little doofy at first, it’s also accurate. Garcia and his friends took up bluegrass and old-time music in the early ’60s with the same bright-eyed bushy-tailed enthusiasm that young folkies have displayed in every decade since. The difference is what the soon ex-Drifters did with it. Garcia fed folk traditions into the Dead’s psychedelic maw and eventually became an influential figure in bluegrass in his own right, inspiring longhairs to take to the banjo after his participation in 1975’s best-selling Old & in the Way. Though Deadheads have traded hissy audience recordings of Garcia’s early projects for decades, the KZSU tape never even existed as a rumor. It was found by filmmaker (and liner note writer) Brian Miksis in 2008 and never circulated. Taped in mono around a single microphone in the last months of 1962 at Stanford University’s KZSU, the Hart Valley Drifters were decidedly non-Stanford students and the opposite of radicals. The quintet hew strictly to the bounds of bluegrass and old-time music, even making sure to distinguish between the two styles during their band introductions, with Garcia playing guitar on the former, banjo on the latter. And it’s not that they’re especially breathtaking or groundbreaking traditionalists, either. They pick well together and know how to sing as a group. Even some notes don’t arrive in perfect harmony, the gospel back-and-forth of “Standing in the Need of Prayer” and dynamics of traditional foot-stompers like “Pig in a Pen” come off with jubilance, offering a hint of the charm that would (for some) carry the Dead through their most ragged moments. The Drifters probably wouldn’t be of much interest if not for their personnel. Comparing the one track Folk Time shares with Garcia’s later bluegrass combo Old & In the Way, “Pig in a Pen,” reveals everything the Hart Valley Drifters lacked, but could taste. But, like Bob Dylan hoboing around Greenwich Village covering Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly songs, Folk Time is the sound of Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter absorbing their own set of influences, building their repertoires, and finding their voices.Containing the only extant recordings of Garcia singing Dock Boggs’s “Sugar Baby” (likely learned from Harry Smith’s fabled Anthology of American Folk Music) and winking, 19th-century sexual-political ballads like “Billy Grimes, the Rover,” Folk Time will be a delight for acoustic-minded Dead freaks. Eventually becoming one of rock’s most distinct vocalists, often getting by on charisma and expressiveness more than note-for-note accuracy, Garcia’s singing on Folk Time is far more developed than other circulating audience-made folk era tapes (and the earliest Grateful Dead recordings) would suggest. The 20-year-old Garcia fakes the slightest Southern twang on the opening “Roving Gambler” and elsewhere, perhaps involuntarily, but mostly his affable California reediness is in place. Unquestionably the best performance on the disc is the closer, a blues arrangement of “Sitting on the Top of the World” featuring only Ken Frankel’s guitar and Garcia’s voice, and a sure stunner for Deadheads. There’s a touch more of the affected twang, but the performance and recording transcend Garcia’s age and experience, drawing from a quiet power and providing the only real glimpse of the singer he would become in the Dead. Perhaps even using the single microphone as an instrument, Garcia’s voice brushes down to a whisper. Moving with a lazy gait, Garcia catches the song’s carelessness with all the conviction of a California native. Though Garcia’s singing had a long way to go, it’s especially evident how the conversational instrumental details of the Hart Valley Drifters could turn into the improvisational pockets of the Dead, the traded lines of “Nine Pound Hammer” only a few volts away from the twining guitars of “China Cat Sunflower.” Picking up the banjo after being discharged from the Army in 1960, Garcia immersed himself in folk music for a half-decade, practicing obsessively, working as a music teacher, and playing in a series of bands around the Palo Alto area, including the Thunder Mountain Tub Thumpers, the Black Mountain Boys, and others. Like many other central ’60s musicians who would eventually plug in and freak out, Garcia came of musical age during the great folk scare, finding post-War solace in ancient (and ancient-seeming) songs. Only a few years from dashing headlong into the neon-pulsing present tense of LSD, Garcia and others first dove deep into a mythic past that seemed to come alive in the grooves of old records and zoetrope-like flicker between banjo rolls.But they don’t always sound as if they believe it themselves. The album’s most unconvincing performance isn’t one of the mountain songs or labor tunes, but the traditional “All the Good Times Have Past and Gone.” Nelson was 19, Garcia was 20, and Hunter was 21 and who even could take that sentiment seriously coming from them? It’s perhaps the same reason why Garcia seems to occupy “Sitting on Top of the World” so effortlessly, a song he would sing as an ebullient bounce on the Dead’s 1967 studio debut and keep in his songbook until just before his 30th birthday in 1972. But with the Hart Valley Drifters in the early ’60s, the good times were only just showing the first signs of starting.\"],[22610,\"For the better part of the 2010s, the role of British misery troubadour has been occupied by two people named Adele: Adele Laurie Blue Adkins—the Adele-Adele—and Adele Emily Sandé. Industry-wise, they occupy much the same niche: colossal-voiced balladeers of inoffensive angst and outlier sales. But the two artists are subtly different. The mononymic Adele’s music is rooted in Northern soul and not much else; when she brought popmaker Max Martin in for 25 it was both surprising and, for Max, restrained. Sandé follows more trends; her solo debut “Heaven” was hitched to the UK’s breakbeat revival, and subsequent singles have brought in grime and David Guetta’s brand of EDM. Adele’s music was adopted quickly by the X Factor-industrial complex; Sandé, who began her career as a Syco songwriter, was part of it from the start.Perhaps as a result, Adele’s music, with the notable exception of “Rolling in the Deep,” is human-sized—her songs are written to slot into the mundane heartbreaks and little resignations of everyday life. Sandé writes songs that start at cinematic and scale upward. (She must have been peeved she didn’t get to do the theme to Skyfall.) Her natural home is the place many Britons first met her (if not Americans): the 2012 London Olympics, where she performed in the opening and closing ceremonies.This is all well and good if you’re cheering on thousands of athletes, or soundtracking a trailer. It’s somewhat less so if you’re recording an album. Several tracks on Long Live the Angels, Sandé’s second, long-gestating LP, were co-produced by English DJ Naughty Boy, best known for crossover hit and Sam Smith showcase “La La La.” But instead of doing what he did there—curating bubbling-up dance trends like the ones on Sandé’s best hits—Naughty Boy indulges his, and her, most maudlin tendencies. A gospel choir appears barely one minute in; it remains in residence for most of the album. Sandé sings, well and interchangeably, over over a dozen tracks of stately but amorphous gloom—the sort of beige dramatics The Guardian dubbed, in 2011, “the new boring.” This is your pain with an acoustic guitar. This is your pain as a piano ballad. This is your pain with “Bleeding Love” drums. This is your pain with a small choir. This is your pain with a large choir. When Sandé finally perfects the formula, on “Highs and Lows,” it's after at least eight other tries.“Garden” would normally be a waste of Emeli—she's barely on it—but here it's triply a relief: for its sinuous, minimalist beat, for the bookending performance by British poet Áine Zion, for its being among the rare times Jay Electronica is a refreshing presence. “Tenderly” isn’t much of a song on its own, but the inclusion of the Serenje Choir—a nod to Sandé’s Zambian heritage—at least distinguishes the track. “Hurts,” the big single, takes a bit to get going, but once it does, it really does: a sudden tempo shift, handclaps, mood like gathering clouds. The tempo leaves no time for X Factor emoting, which means Sandé can provide emotion instead; her voice goes ragged and her words turn bitter (“oh man, what a tragedy, ha ha”). Being an Emeli Sandé song, it eventually turns into a power ballad like the rest, but the swell feels earned. Too much of Long Live the Angels just feels turgid.\"],[22518,\"Like plenty of ambitious musicians in New York’s classical community, the clarinetist and saxophonist Ken Thomson has multiple artistic guises. He’s part of Asphalt Orchestra, a puckish street marching band that dances its covers of Björk and Meshuggah through the heart of the Lincoln Center complex. Slow\\/Fast is a vehicle for Thomson’s proggy approach to jazz writing and improvisation. Most recently, Thomson was inducted into the Bang on a Can All-Stars, a modern classical group that has recorded a Pulitzer-winning piece by Julia Wolfe, and commissioned new works by Tyondai Braxton and Christian Marclay.Given those varied commitments, it’s impressive that Thomson has time to develop his chamber music on the side. In these pieces, you can tell that he’s firmly a member of the contemporary post-minimalist scene. Though there are also traces of his other interests. Thaw, Thomson’s 2013 album for the string quartet known as JACK, balanced sections of instrumental aggression alongside a movement flush with lyricism (and a hat-tip to jazz pianist Don Pullen).That album presented two longer-form, multi-movement works. And on the first composition, Thomson sat in with the string quartet as a bass clarinetist—thereby suggesting a link to the rest of his discography. But Restless represents a full and complete break from Thomson’s identity as a performer. The four-movement composition that gives the album its title was written for cello and piano; the three-movement “Me Vs.” is for piano solo. One mark of the album’s success is that it’s still recognizable as one of Thomson’s projects, despite the fact that he never plays a note himself.The opening section of “Restless” starts with slowly mutating piano arpeggios that whip up a grim mood, along with some vibrato-heavy writing for the cello. Fairly standard textures, when it comes to minimalist-influenced music. But by the track’s midpoint, Thomson’s harmonies are full of feints and surprising paths away from the opening material. The way some piano chords syncopate with the cello part provides an unsettling bounce, right at the moment when Thomson gives a long, brooding line to the latter instrument. (Cellist Ashley Bathgate and pianist Karl Larson give powerful performances here.)The piece’s second movement, “Forge,” initially indulges in the harder-riffing attacks that Thomson has proved adept with in other contexts. Though instead of letting the punkish grind carry this whole section, the composer quickly softens the dynamic level. When used well, restraint can also shock. “Me Vs.” likewise navigates between stormy realms and zones of prettiness, as gentle phrases gradually emerge from dense, atonal chord clusters in the first movement (subtitled “Turn of Phrase”). When the pounding dynamics return—as a listener has ever right to expect will happen—elegant use of the sustain pedal is there to remind us of the emotional distance traveled. The second movement (“Another Second Try”) offers a gently discordant, pensive quality, before the finale combines all the work’s diverse approaches. (The last movement also adds some technically arduous runs that Larson pulls off marvelously). Overall, the unique synthesis of dissonance and consonance makes the music feel personal—and like a worthy expression of Thomson’s core concerns as a musician, whether he’s holding an instrument in his hands or not.  \"],[22527,\"In 1976, composer Philip Glass and director Robert Wilson executed an ingenious end-run around the cautious classical music establishment of their day. After a short workshop and tour in Europe, the creative partners decided that Einstein on the Beach—a four-hour plus, non-narrative opera—was ready for its American debut. So they rented the Metropolitan Opera house for two nights. It was more than a sold-out success. It was a decade-defining sensation in New York’s artistic community. The brief run also set Glass and Wilson back nearly $100,000. (Renting the biggest opera house in the country wasn't cheap.) In the immediate aftermath of Einstein’s American premiere, Glass famously went back to driving his cab. But the pinnacle of this composer’s early, hardcore minimalist period—which relied on hypnotically long, not-quite-repeating melodic lines—would lead to a major-label deal before long.CBS Masterworks reissued Glass’ independent studio recording of most of the music from Einstein in 1979. Glass had shortened some scenes for the first LP issue—on the logic that without Wilson’s stage tableaus, trims were advisable. But everything that made the recording still clicks. The synths have a snarl that’s appropriate, given the opera’s Downtown New York parentage. The big ensemble riffs motor along at thrilling tempos; the “trial” scenes unfold with otherworldly ease. The spoken vocals produce deadpan surrealism. (Check out the delirious syllabic layering in “Knee Play 2.”)  And the instrumental performance of the Philip Glass Ensemble—which included wind instruments and a small chorus—is locked in beyond belief.Forty years on, this first recording of Einstein has never been bettered as an audio-only experience of the opera. A booming live performance from 1984 comes close; a ‘90s re-recording that restored the excised music isn’t anywhere as energetic or as charming. The only rival way to experience this avant-garde triumph involves doing so with Wilson’s dazzling staging added—something that’s now possible, thanks to a home-video version of Einstein’s most recent revival tour. Still, the inaugural Glass recording remains the ideal way to put the melodies and rhythms into your ears. After reissuing Einstein, CBS Masterworks signed Glass to an exclusive contract as a performer. Over the following decade, Glass delivered nine albums to the label: a haul that included two other stage pieces from his first opera trilogy, an iconic solo piano set, and several long-form works for the composer’s house band. Those protean sessions form the core of The Complete Sony Recordings. (That title reflects the subsequent corporate acquisition of CBS Records; stray Glass recordings for Sony that postdate his CBS years are also included.) This 24-CD box also offers a few exclusive bells and whistles meant to entice collectors—some of which prove revelatory. But in a classical marketplace clogged with reissue sets, the key selling point of this one is its contextual comprehensiveness. Full librettos, stage-action summaries and various liner notes are provided not just for Einstein, but for every album here. Most importantly, the box’s accompanying book provides key information on two of Glass’ most important dramatic works: the Gandhi opera Satyagraha and the ancient Egyptian tale Akhnaten—a piece that saw Glass writing for a traditional opera company, for the first time.Though it didn’t immediately take the opera world by storm in 1980, Satyagraha is now acclaimed as as one of Glass’ milestones. The commission allowed Glass to leave his various odd jobs behind and to focus on composing full time. He responded with a magisterial score that dramatized Gandhi’s time in South Africa, and that also reflected the thinker’s broader journey from newspaperman to activist to political philosopher. The second act’s climactic “Protest” has a galvanic force, thanks to Glass’ strange-but-stirring union of string orchestra and synthesizer. In the third act, Satyagraha looks ahead to the subsequent legacy of nonviolent direct action, as extended to Martin Luther King, Jr. Glass’ score closes with an ascending melody that, with its simultaneous suggestion of vulnerability and determination, makes for one of the most soul-stirring moments in contemporary opera. In an abstract theatrical touch, the entire libretto for Satyagraha is adapted from the Bhagavad-Gita—the Sanskrit text of which creates a spiritual accompaniment for the opera’s stage action. To follow the narrative on a recording, English-speaking audiences need a track-by-track translation of the Sanskrit, as well as summaries of each scene’s onstage particulars. Akhnaten works similarly, through multiple ancient languages. And Einstein’s blizzard of English fragments is also better studied with a printed lyric sheet. Prior budget-CD reissues of all the early Glass operas have ignored this. Consequently, the small hardcover book included with The Complete Sony Recordings feels as though it’s worth its weight in gold.   A lovingly produced reissue set of the opera trilogy alone could have fetched a high price. (After all, those recordings occupy ten of the CDs here.) But this box wisely expands its purview to include everything in the label’s vaults—including shorter, oft-forgotten theatrical works like The Photographer. As a result, this set allows listeners to re-encounter the decade of Glass’ rise to a position of pop-culture prominence. While Glass was often sensitive to the idea that he was betraying his classical training by become a “crossover” artist, the Sony recordings do shed light on his fascination with the way different audiences might absorb contemporary composition. His first album under the exclusive contract with CBS, 1982’s Glassworks, was a consciously scaled-down look at his aesthetic. Instead of presenting multiple hours of his gradually morphing themes, the suite of six compact pieces plays in just under 40 minutes. The standard mix is perhaps the most well-known and ubiquitous of all his recordings. But since 1982 was also the era of the Walkman, Glass and his sound designer created a version of Glassworks “specially mixed for your personal cassette player.”The inclusion of the “cassette mix” in this box marks its first digital release. Bursting with low-end thump and a punchy, less-separated stereo sound, this bonus mix of Glassworks blows away the more genteel, familiar version. Here, the album’s first emotional swing—from the pensive “Opening” to the mechanized march of “Floe”—registers even more grandly. Better than any other CD in the Sony box, it comes closest to representing the potent live sound of the Philip Glass Ensemble, when amplified in a large venue. (This mix of Glassworks also prefigures the strategy of contemporary classical imprints like New Amsterdam, which work to produce recordings in ways that will appeal to all sorts of listeners.)Not every experiment from this period paid off. Songs from the Trilogy was a useful compilation, back when recordings of Glass’ early operas represented a more substantial physical-media investment. Now it’s a curiosity. And Songs from Liquid Days is a strange misfire. Its harmonic progressions and ensemble tempos seem consistently alienated from the pop-song lyrics (written, variously, by David Byrne, Laurie Anderson, Paul Simon and Suzanne Vega). And the vocal performances—by the Roches, Linda Ronstadt and the lead from the cast of Satyagraha—often sound equally uncertain of the appropriate texture to pursue. Still, it’s a fascinating look at a composer with a long corporate leash, and a willingness to play around. More successful are albums for Glass’ ensemble, originally commissioned as scores for dance performances. These include the miniatures found on DancePieces and the opulent, side-length statements on Dance Nos. 1-5. And the composer’s popular reputation hit a new level with the release of Solo Piano—still one of the most fervently beloved entries in his vast catalog. This record gave fans an intimate encounter with Glass’ solo-instrumental style, and also offered premieres of major pieces like “Metamorphosis” and “Wichita Sutra Vortex.” The former is a piece that has been admired and performed by Blood Orange. The latter is a work that many elite classical virtuosos fail to pull off with exuberance of the more technically limited Glass.In 1993, Glass jumped from CBS\\/Sony to Nonesuch—a label that he’d been sneaking movie soundtracks to, on the side, for some time. Before long, Glass would establish his own imprint, Orange Mountain Music (which remains the place to find his latter-day chamber music, operas and symphonic statements). But Sony has also stayed in the Glass business, here and there. It recorded Itaipu\\/The Canyon—one of Glass’ early forays into orchestral writing for its own sake—in 1993. (Glass would quickly outstrip this effort with several later symphonies.) Thanks to the label’s association with Yo-Yo Ma, this box gets to claim Glass’ fine soundtrack to Naqoyqatsi (on which the cellist performs).Sony also has the rights to Passages, Glass’ 1990 reunion with Ravi Shankar, his onetime mentor. On that album, each composer arranged themes by the other. Not everything there comes off seamlessly, but it’s a blast to hear Shankar’s adaptation of Glassian melody. The box also gathers obscure sets like Organ Works—an interesting series of Glass arrangements, performed by Donald Joyce. There’s also a rarities collection titled Recent Recordings. It’s a fun listen, even if it contains some recordings that aren’t all that recent. (A short Glass Ensemble performance at the 1984 Olympics torch-lighting ceremony? Sure, let’s have it!)Aside from the obscure “cassette mix” of Glassworks, however, the exclusive material advertised on the packaging doesn’t have much to do with the true value of this box. The real attraction is the half of the set that sits in the excellent-to-iconic zone of Glass’ catalog. A lot of that material has been widely available for years—though often without important contextual material that can aid deeper immersion. This reverent, smartly produced set fixes that problem. In doing so, The Complete Sony Recordings represents a worthy completion of the company’s original investment in a young composer.\"],[22623,\"The music industry is rarely generous with fairytale successes, but the closest thing to one was bequeathed last year upon 22-year-old German-Haitian songwriter Bibi Bourelly. Discovered on Instagram, Bourelly was introduced to Kanye West and, more broadly, to the songwriting industry in perpetual need of young creatives to lend the stars some trickle-up swag. After some abortive writing for Usher, Bourelly found a taker in Rihanna, whose albums are a pretty reliable microcosm of songwriting trends; of her prolific output, Rih cut the brash pre-Anti single “Bitch Better Have My Money” and the sloshed torch song “Higher.” The songs could scarcely be different in production—the former set to grinding trap by Travis Scott, the latter to relatively tranquil soul—but Bourelly’s influence is stark and clear. Where former Rih surrogates like Ester Dean assembled songs explicitly around hooks, retrofitting words and meaning later, Bourelly’s approach is more that of an open-mic songwriter: sprawling, unfiltered, every lyric sung to the breaking point. The Rihanna stint turned into a deal with Def Jam and several solo singles, compiled on an EP this May: the on-the-nose Free the Real (Pt. 1). Unfiltered was certainly the aim, or at least a version of authenticity filtered through folk and acoustic rock. Single “Sally” is a bluesy ruckus of handclaps and scuzzed-up guitar, “Ego” twangy and stalking, “What If” almost grunge. Though the EP perhaps demonstrated more promise than mastery, it was certainly her own.Pt. 2 is much of the same: more notebook sketches of titles: (“Poet,” “Untitled”) and more acoustic cuts that bear little resemblance to pop, R&B, or—refreshingly—the vast swath of alt-pop artists tipped as her peers. Bourelly’s age and pop gigs have saddled her with comparisons to precocious pop quirkers like Alessia Cara and Lorde, but they’re a poor fit. Her actual predecessors are closer to PJ Harvey or Janis Joplin, and—for better and worse—she comes off less as a pre-branded star and more as a writer finding her voice in real time. Her literal voice is unsurprisingly strong and versatile: sometimes zero-fucks blasé, sometimes scratchy and vulnerable, and sometimes—as on her Rihanna ballads—a confrontational belt. But her writing voice is the main draw: the voice of a girl who grew up on hip-hop and saw no reason why it couldn’t coexist with folk-rock or country. There’s perennial talk, of course, about young artists growing up in the streaming era being unbound by genres; in particular, 2016 has found almost every pop star dabbling in acoustic genres (cynically, perhaps driven by Top 40’s playlists shrinking and the increasing dominance of country and AC formats). Bourelly sounds like it was her idea all along.The downside to being unformed is there’s still a lot you’ve got to get out of your system. On this EP, that’s “Poet.” It’s got the slickest production on the album: rock-radio sheen, with precisely timed strings and backing-singer interjections. But it’s also got the hook “you’re my Kurt Cobain,” and its other metaphors—cocaine, rock’n’roll—aren’t much better. Bourelly’s other material, thankfully, is far more compelling: the prickly guitar intro and plainspoken disses of “Flowers” (“I may smoke a lot of marijuana\\/But I’m not your little whore”); the assured stomp of “Fool,” and especially the single “Ballin.” It’s the best song written to date about the precarious quasi-fame one can fall into as a rising artist, where you can write multiple Rihanna hits, make the magazine rounds and 25 Under 25 roundups, sing on Colbert, be highly Googleable, and yet still be broke as fuck. Bourelly begins the track by announcing, as casually as you’d mention a papercut, getting fired from Old Navy; then, with this-too-will-pass assurance, she continues through the details: dodging landlords, jumping subway turnstiles, living off ramen and hot sauce, feeling ambivalent about the paparazzi who are one degree of separation away. As a montage of the music-industry fairytale as it looks to those living it, it’s striking. But as a snapshot of Bibi Bourelly’s career, judging by her material it may soon prove itself quite modest. \"],[22563,\"Scott Morgan’s trajectory as Loscil, the moniker under which he produces his solo work, seems more befitting of a biologist than an ambient music veteran. Over the past sixteen years, Morgan has shaped his electronic sound around subjects like subatomic particles (Triple Point), shadowy ocean depths (Submers), shore life (First Narrows), and the traits of airborne substances (Plume). Even the intention behind his free-flowing arrangements is scientific, as Morgan has often acknowledged his aim to recreate the properties of water in music. But where his previous albums have aspired, almost methodically, to map the movement and texture of wave energy, Monument Builders, Morgan’s eleventh album, maps a more human, and less quantifiable, concept: life’s resistance to dark and destructive forces.Extending the notions of community that were brought to a head on his recent EP for Greta—a charity album to raise money for a friend's child diagnosed with bone cancer—Morgan now charts the progression of life from the arid wasteland of “Drained Lake” to the first tiny sprouts of growth in “Weeds.” Monument Builders is a highly visual album, a mosaic of images depicting construction, erasure, devastation, redemption, and transformation. The sounds of micro-cassette recorders, decrepit samples, and grinding chains of percussion evoke a strong sense of place, the same way fuzz on a vintage videotape evokes age. “Red Tide,” with its layered percussive onslaught and brass like steaming train whistles, announces the rising of the sea, just as the cascading pianos of “Deceiver” very nearly resembles rain falling after a thunderstorm.  As is typical in his work, Morgan uses the first four songs of the album to mount tension. Darkness lingers in the title track, which builds around a single quivering note. The anticipation culminates in “Straw Dogs,” a menacing track with screeching horns, named in honor of anti-humanist philosopher John Gray’s book of the same name, which speaks to the dangers of placing humanity at the center of the universe. The ominous edge behind the compositions would seem to indicate that Morgan subscribes to Gray’s ideas about our own propensity for geological and social destruction. But the album’s three remaining songs suggest something slightly more optimistic.“Deceiver,” with its weepy, penitent piano, eventually gives way to a high-pitch wailing that expresses acute feelings of grief. Gray’s philosophy seems to appear again  in “Anthropocene”—the name for our current geological epoch, marked by harmful human centrality—and the song’s pulsating, intense bass line drives our guilt and grief through moments of self-reflection, mourning, and change. By the time we arrive at “Weeds,” the album’s final song, we are ready to confront punishment. Only we discover, from a murmur-like flicker of synth notes, that what awaits us are the sounds of human voices crying out from the dark. Among our distress and destruction, Morgan concludes, hopefully, that life persists.In this way, Monument Builders is oddly reminiscent of “Directive,” one of Robert Frost’s last poems, which also advances ideas of survival and endurance. Much like with Builders, in “Directive” we follow a guide through a place of decay and dissolution. At the end of our journey, our guide says to us, “Here are your waters and your watering place.\\/Drink and be whole again beyond confusion.” Scott Morgan has made a career of showing us waters and watering places. With Monument Builders, we are finally invited to drink.  \"],[22505,\"Communicating unbridled enthusiasm the same way Johnny Rotten once vocalized a sneer, Peter Stampfel’s singing is the type that might either drive people from rooms or pull them closer. An underground musician in the early 1960s and an underground musician now, the fiddler-banjoist’s gleeful howl has always framed his music as belonging to some faction of the other, as symbolic as a fuzzed-out guitar once seemed to be. Except in the 21st century, with the out-of-control charge of the Stooges’ “Search and Destroy” most lately heard in an Audi ad campaign, Stampfel’s voice continues to be exactly as untamable as it was in the ’60s, an aural pointer to a wild bohemia.On Holiday For Strings, the 78-year-old Stampfel remains in a spirit of full folky joy, an embodiment of old-time string band chaos before its somber post-O Brother, Where Art Thou reconstruction. An early convert to Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music and its vision of an “old, weird America” (in Greil Marcus’ term), Stampfel took more to the weird than the old. But having hung on to his weird for three-quarters of a century, he now gets to be both, and his personable croak finds unlikely entrance points to unlikely songs. Recording with an ensemble dubbed the Brooklyn & Lower Manhattan Fiddle\\/Mandolin Swarm (for its buzzing three-fiddle-minimum arrangements), the result is actually a chaotic big band that gives Stampfel a sympathetic and ever-changing bed for his singing. It is the sound of people making music together, pianos and steel guitars appearing alongside other vibrations as needed, playing songs entirely dictated by what might be called “the folk process.” With only two of the songs credited fully to Stampfel (the instrumentals “Lily” and “Lonely Goth Girl”), the rest are modified traditional or contemporary numbers or songs with blurrier origins (like a version of the fiddle instrumental “Blackberry Blossom” with lyrics by Michelle Shocked).As co-founder of the ’60s\\/’70s folk-imploding Holy Modal Rounders, Stampfel was the first to use the word “psychedelic” in a recorded song on “Hesitation Blues” in 1964 and going semi-electric with everybody else a few years later. But Stampfel has remained a fully committed folkie through decades of bands and creative partnerships, most lately with New York songwriter Jeffrey Lewis. It is here that Stampfel’s very vocal enthusiasm generates meaning within his music, providing a source for his long-term creative energy as much as his in-the-moment expression. On Holiday For Strings, Stampfel takes hold of traditional tunes like “Johnny Get Your Gun” and “Yankee Doodle,” turning the latter into a topical stomp on gun nuts, “Honky Doody.” But the album finds its heart in less-traditional borrowings, like introducing Joe Meek’s 1962 space-age instrumental “Telstar” into the folk canon.While there’s fun to be had, the album’s best performances come on a trio of tender pop songs, each sounding like a more unhinged version of the recent albums of standards arranged for string bands by Stampfel’s former jamming buddy and one-time roommate, Bob Dylan. Just as with Dylan’s Shadows in the Night, it might be easy enough to giggle while Stampfel’s voice warbles and breaks through “I Can’t Stop Loving You,” Ray Charles’ countrypolitan hit written by Don Gibson. But, as with Dylan, that would be to miss Stampfel’s deeply human and well-read performance, as cracked as Gibson’s original is smooth. The same holds true of the album’s two most devastating moments, a nearly straight cover of Lou Reed’s “Cremation,” from 1992’s Magic and Loss, rewritten lightly as “Cold Black Sea,” and “Star in the Wind,” written with Stampfel’s former girlfriend\\/collaborator, the one-named Antonia. Sounding like something Dylan might get to yet, the words come sourced from a mid-’50s installment of Walt Kelly’s comic strip, Pogo, a poem by the artist about a daughter who died in infancy. There is a modesty to Stampfel’s half-century of small-scale folk detonations, but also an earnest and inviting curiosity. His verve spills into textual form via grammar-busting liner notes (though Stampfel is also a professional copyeditor), like a musical equivalent of a Facebook wall crammed with annotated YouTube clips. As filled with excitement to be playing and sharing music in his 70s as he was as a teen, Holiday For Strings works just as well as a recruiting poster for the future folkies of America. Like punk, the anarchic arrangements contain the message that anybody can do this, but Stampfel also makes a pretty excellent argument for why it’s still worth doing.\"],[22465,\"Christian Marclay was one of turntablism’s earliest pioneers. Throughout the 1980s, the multimedia artist plundered the discographies of others: scratching and refracting one Hendrix jam into a fresh psychedelic swirl, or layering several pieces by Chopin or Louis Armstrong into new soundscapes. Less indebted to hip-hop sonics than to the genre-blending aesthetics of John Zorn, Marclay eventually began to collaborate with a range of players that included Thurston Moore and Ikue Mori. Since his 24-hour installation film The Clock became a smash hit in contemporary art circles, Marclay has noticeably scaled back his turntablist practice. In recent years, he’s collaborated more with musicians through the interface of his collage-style “graphic scores.” But he still occasionally busts out his cartons of vinyl, as he did with the cellist Okkyung Lee for a 2014 performance at London’s Cafe Oto. Now released under the title Amalgam, the concert is easily one of Marclay’s most invigorating performances as a turntablist this century—and leagues more interesting than a pair of gigs released on limited-edition vinyl in conjunction with a 2015 gallery show in London.A good deal of Amalgam’s success has to do with Marclay’s duet partner, Okkyung Lee. The cellist has demonstrated her avant-improv bona fides on her collaboration with piano great Cecil Taylor. And her own compositions display Lee’s skills with lyricism and melody, in between passages of crunch and noise. Appropriately, she has as many ideas for coaxing sounds from the cello as Marclay has strategies for abusing vinyl. This mutual acuity gives solid shape to their 36-minute, fully improvised performance.After Marclay opens with samples that employ shifts in playback speed, Lee’s cello can be heard quietly, insistently repeating a short jagged phrase—a cellist’s imitation of a turntable scratch. Lee’s development of this brief figure gradually incorporates longer-held tones and broader fingerboard swoops, both of which help a listener identify her cello as the source of these particular sounds. By then, Marclay has begun splicing together noisier shards.Not long after these discrete positions have been staked out by the two players, they pivot to blend their approaches. Occasionally, a figure that could have been produced by the live string player is revealed to be a Marclay sample, plucked from some string-laden LP. Metallic scrapings or atmospheric trails of sound production can seem like fodder from a vintage recording—until an expressive, violent burst in the line shows that this has all come from Lee’s cello.This back and forth journey, between easy recognition of the different players and more ambiguous duo textures, creates much of the performance’s excitement at a minute-by-minute level. The larger structure follows a loose, three-movement style, with a quieter middle section that takes over in the fourteenth minute. Unlike many of Marclay’s past duo recordings with other artists, this session with Lee doesn’t include many recognizable samples. (You don’t even get any Anthony Braxton breaks that have cropped up in the turntablist’s collaborations with Elliott Sharp or Günter Müller.) But after this inspired performance, what lingers is the dazzling newness that Lee and Marclay create by exploring the outer fringes of timbre.\"],[22506,\"When hardcore punk emerged in the early ’80s, it was partially a reaction to the tired old rules of bloated commercial rock’n’roll. But it didn’t take long for hardcore to start devising its own rules, which is why the Minutemen were such a welcome jolt to the scene. They weren’t outsiders; formed in 1980 in the southern Los Angeles community of San Pedro, they often opened for neighboring hardcore trailblazers Black Flag, whose guitarist Greg Ginn signed the Minutemen to his SST label after the first time he saw them play. They had punk bona fides, too: bassist Mike Watt, guitarist D. Boon, and drummer George Hurley were working-class kids, sons of a sailor, a mechanic, and a machinist. They all held onto day jobs and stayed loyal to San Pedro throughout the band’s existence. In outline, the Minutemen’s sound fit with punk’s  minimal, straight-to-the-point ethos. One of their most quoted lyrics—“We jam econo,” later used as the title for a 2005 Minutemen documentary—referred literally to the cheap Econoline van that they drove and slept in to save money. But it perfectly characterized their taut, efficient music, doled out in quick jolts —most tunes lasted less than two minutes—in order to move onto new ideas as fast as possible. Even the short, sharp sound of the five-syllable “we jam econo,” which the band would sometimes shorten further to simply “econo,” demonstrates its own point.Yet as compact as they were, Minutemen songs sounded nothing like hardcore punk. Boon’s guitar was scratchy and wiry; Watt’s bass was busy and melodic; Hurley’s drumming was polyrhythmic and syncopated. Some tracks were like fractured jazz, some like moody folk, some like off-speed funk. They weren’t interested in pure volume or aggression; what drew the trio to punk was the chance to play anything they wanted. “Punk rock doesn’t have to mean hardcore or one style of music,” Watt told Flipside in 1985. “It can mean freedom and going crazy and being personal with your art….it really blows people’s minds because here we are the most hardcore-looking bunch out there and our music is the furthest from it.” In a scene that was already drawing lines in the sand about what was and wasn’t hardcore, declaring that kind of liberation was pretty rebellious.One of the most famous Minutemen songs, “History Lesson (Part II),” sounds like a homage to the hardcore milieu that birthed them. “Me and Mike Watt played for years\\/and punk rock changed our lives,” Boon sings matter-of-factly, over a gentle melody inspired by the Velvet Underground’s “Here She Comes Now.” But the tune was also a plea for acceptance into hardcore circles that didn’t know what to make of the Minutemen. As fan Mike Brady said in Craig Ibarra's San Pedro punk oral history A Wailing of a Town, “The Minutemen shocked everybody when they first saw them, because you went to punk gigs expecting poor music. A lot of the bands weren’t that good back then, they could barely play.” Or as Erik Korte of fellow punk band Throbbing Members bluntly put it, “They just weren’t that hardcore.” That opinion was often shared by audiences. The first time they opened for Black Flag, the Minutemen were showered with spit from the crowd; even two years later, during a headlining set in their own hometown, they were booed off the stage.“I wrote (History Lesson - Part II) to try to humanize us,” Watt said in Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991, Michael Azerrad’s book on punk history who title comes from a “History Lesson - Part II” lyric. “People thought we were spacemen, but we were just Pedro corndogs... You could be us, this could be you. We’re not that much different from you cats.”“History Lesson - Part II” appeared on the Minutemen’s third album, 1984’s Double Nickels on the Dime, a two-record set that showed this band actually was pretty different, even when they fit in. Most of the album’s 45 songs were fast and short, but Double Nickels as a whole is not really “econo.” It’s as much an art record as a punk record, using found sounds, off-the-cuff experiments, cut-and-paste lyrics, radical politics, and references to all kinds of art that influenced the trio. It reveals a band eager to try things even if they don’t work out (one side is self-deprecatingly called “Side Chaff”). Double Nickels’ closest parallel isn’t any punk album, but the alternately tight\\/loose sprawl of Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band’s Trout Mask Replica.The concepts underpinning Double Nickels came about partially by accident. In early 1983, the Minutemen had recorded enough songs to make a single album. But before they finished it, their friends and SST labelmates, Minneapolis trio Hüsker Dü, came to town and recorded the two-LP set Zen Arcade in less than a week. Watt took this as a dare: if their pals could make a double album, why couldn’t the Minutemen? (He would later add a playful “take that, Hüskers!” to the liner notes of Double Nickels).They  were certainly up to the task. They had already made seven records in just three years as a band—two full lengths and five EPs—and songs continued to pour out of them. They wrote and recorded 20 more in just a few weeks, with all three band members contributing music and lyrics, though Boon sang on most tracks. In total, Double Nickels took just six days of recording and one all-night mixing session. But because the double-album idea emerged in the middle of the process, finding a unifying concept was a tougher job. Zen Arcade had an overarching story—that of a young boy running away from home—but the most the Minutemen could come up with was two smaller schemes.First, Watt borrowed a concept from Pink Floyd’s 1969 double album Ummagumma: each side included a solo song by one band member, and the rest of that side’s songs were chosen by that person (side four got all the leftover songs, and was thus deemed the “chaff” side). Second, Watt chose the album title and artwork as a response to Sammy Hagar’s insipid 1984 hit “I Can’t Drive 55.” “Double nickels” meant the 55 mph national speed limit that Watt is seen driving on the album cover—a way to say he’d rather live safely and play radical music than the other way around. The two concepts overlapped in snippets of car engine sounds at the head of each side—a suggestion from SST’s Joe Carducci—which were recorded directly from each band members’ own vehicle.These ideas were clever but perhaps too subtle (Watt has admitted that few outside of the group caught onto either reference). The Minutemen’s aesthetic was never about grand concepts anyway, but about curiosity and openness and hunger for something new. They were interested in highbrow and lowbrow, mainstream and underground, influenced as much by Blue Oyster Cult and Creedence Clearwater Revival as Wire and the Pop Group. They were also as political as any punk band at the time, but their songs were more about complex issues that you had to research than generic anti-Reagan rants. Take the opening lines of Double Nickels’ “Viet Nam”: “Let’s say I got a number\\/That number’s 50,000\\/That’s 10% of 500,000.” As Michael Fournier points out in his 33\\/3 book on the album, that sounds at first like random math, but it turns out that roughly 50,000 Americans were killed in the Vietnam War, as opposed to over 500,000 North Vietnamese. These kind of granular details were the work of homegrown intellectuals, DIY aesthetes: when the Minutemen argued about history or culture during band practice, they’d jump in their van and drive to the library to settle the conflict.On Double Nickels, this mindset produces songs that are concrete and abstract, bold and subtle, workmanlike and postmodern. “Shit From an Old Notebook” sounds like a blunt screed: “Let the products sell themselves!\\/Fuck advertising and commercial psychology!” screams Boon over a circling Watt\\/Hurley rhythm. Yet its creation was less about protest than chance technique: Watt pieced together the song’s words from scraps of notebook pages he found in Boon’s van. Similar juxtapositions arise in “One Reporter’s Opinion,” which at first seems to be Boon’s critique of Watt: “What can be romantic to Mike Watt?\\/He’s only a skeleton!” But Watt wrote the song himself, inspired by the perspective-switching narrative voice in James Joyce’s ultra-dense classic Ulysses. (Watt’s obsession with Joyce also emerges in the instrumental “June 16th,” titled after the date on which Ulysses takes place).Throughout Double Nickels, chance experiments and artistic influences abound. “Do You Want New Wave or Do You Want the Truth?,” a slow acoustic song with hard-biting lyrics, is a study of how words are manipulated —“should a word have two meanings? Should a word serve the truth?”—inspired by the semiotics theories of Umberto Eco. Watt’s solo song, “Take 5, D.,” was a response to Boon thinking his lyrics were too far out. To be more “real,” Watt read words from a note that a landlady left for a friend—“Hope we can rely on you not to use the shower”—followed by passages of improvised guitar. Hurley’s solo tune—which he chose to open his side, to the surprise of Watt and Boon—is a smattering of cycling percussion and wordless scatting.Some of the experimentation on Double Nickels was born from necessity. Forced to generate lots of songs quickly, the Minutemen turned to San Pedro comrades for help. Some lyrics were written by non-band-members (Watt admitted that the band never even met one of the contributors, Joe Brewer, cousin of fellow San Pedro musician and Saccharine Trust singer Jack Brewer). They took other input, too. Though they had recorded a version of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Don’t Look Now” in the studio, Carducci suggested including a live version instead. He liked its field-recording quality, particularly the way the crowd chattered casually throughout. Watt agreed without even hearing the tape first.The Minutemen’s use of outside contributions on Double Nickels wasn’t just about experimentation. It was also an attempt to foster community. Watt wanted the band to be, as he put it, “a prism” for the whole San Pedro punk scene. “Mike was asking everybody for lyrics,” explained Jack Brewer, who contributed a lyric to Double Nickels. “It made people feel like they were a part of it. ‘Hey, I have some lyrics on the Minutemen record!’ They were sharing their success; they didn’t just keep it to themselves.’ ”If Double Nickels had been nothing but experiments and collaborations, it would have still been interesting, but it wouldn’t have sold out of its original 10,000-copy run nor gotten near-universal acclaim for decades. Most of the album’s 45 songs are tight, catchy, and infinitely repeatable, with D. Boon’s knifing guitar and untethered vocals reacting to Watt and Hurley’s complex yet pogo-ready rhythms. The music is spoken with a vocabulary the Minutemen created themselves and were fully fluent in by just their third full-length. That’s perhaps clearest when they take on other bands’ songs: on the “chaff” side they translate Van Halen’s “Ain’t Talkin’ ’Bout Love” and Steely Dan’s “Dr. Wu” into a new language.That language was so developed and distinct that it’s proven hard to mimic in the three decades since Double Nickels came out. Watt predicted this a bit in his 1985 Flipside interview, discussing why the Minutemen don’t get airplay. “I think one of our problems with radio is that we don’t write songs, we write rivers,” he said. “We play against each other, guitar and bass; we don’t set up a background for our narrative.”As a result, few bands who’ve come along in the decades since actually sound much like the Minutemen. (The band would go on to make two more full lengths and a handful of EPs—including one Project: Mersh that somewhat-jokingly tried to exploit some of the poppier sides of their songwriting on Double Nickels—before D. Boon died tragically in an automobile accident in late 1985). They have influenced many: the Red Hot Chili Peppers dedicated Blood Sugar Sex Magik to Watt, Pavement was named after a line in the Minutemen song “Fake Contest,” Unwound and Sebadoh recorded Minutemen covers, and Jeff Tweedy wrote a song called “D. Boon” for Uncle Tupelo’s Still Feel Gone.They’ve likely inspired more people with their ethics and attitude than their sound. As a model, they are one of the purest DIY punk bands, on a par with groups famous for independence like Minor Threat and Fugazi, Beat Happening, and the Minutemen’s godfathers Black Flag. But the legacy of Double Nickels on the Dime isn’t just that the Minutemen did things themselves. It’s also that they tried everything, ignoring artificial barriers between forms of art, classes of culture, and kinds of influence. “One of the reasons we play all these kinds of musics is for them—to see how seriously they take ‘No Rules’ and ‘Anarchy,’” Watt said to Maximum Rock’n’Roll in 1984. “We throw all this soft music, folk music, jazz, etc. not only to avoid getting caught in just one style, but also to show them that ‘see, you didn’t want any rules— this is what you wanted.’ I know it’s hard for them. It’s easier when it’s all set up for you.”\"],[22581,\"Every year, the film industry reliably churns out a new biographical boxing film with aspirations towards artistry and, hopefully, awards. This year’s entrant is Ben Younger’s Bleed for This, starring the famously boorish Miles Teller (Whiplash, Fantastic Four) as Vinny Paz, a world championship boxer on the road to recovery from a devastating car accident. It was executive produced by Martin Scorsese, in itself setting up an unfortunate parallel to the  already-existing Raging Bull. The soundtrack, meanwhile, pairs selections from artists like Willis Earl Beal with some period-specific ’80s glam, and, intriguingly, several selections from the composer and performer Julia Holter.  Holter provides ten of the eighteen songs on this soundtrack, each a piece of new music from her. It is definitely an odd fit, and the soundtrack doesn’t make any efforts to make sense of it: In its first few tracks we are treated to selections from Billy Squier and Bad Company, selections that serve a scene-setting purpose in the film that they do not serve here. Songs from Willis Earl Beal’s 2013 album Nobody Knows are peppered throughout to add a dash of emotional depth, but Beal’s probing and leftfield soul is mismatched with the film’s rote aggression. This disjunction is even more apparent when Holter’s music appears in the film. For the most part, her contributions are short, almost weightless, instrumental pieces that lean towards ambient. Almost none of the pieces are over a minute long, making them closer to sketches. In the film, they are deployed where easy emotion needs to be summoned.  No matter how beautiful some these tracks can be, they are forced to serve utilitarian ends: “Fighting Dele,” one of the most well-executed pieces, only exists to heighten the tension of Vinny Paz’s title fight against Gilbert Dele. Instead of the old tricks of heavy breathing, audible heartbeats, shaky camera angles, or even silence, Holter’s song is used to make a difficult moment in the fight (right before the telegraphed victory) seem ethereal, almost divine. The strategy ends up making her music feel silly when tied to the film. Worse, Holter’s songs are given the hoary old agenda of making the aggressive and masculine edges of the film seem more sensitive, softer, and intimate. Bleed for This does not break any stereotypes about boxing films. It follows a narrative arc, a cast of characters, and explores a set of emotions (failure, redemption, victory) that are well trodden. The score’s best songs, “Fighting Duran,” (a grandly wrought three-minute ambient song), “Home Movies,” (a short minimalist epic of luxuriant and melancholic strings) and “Vinny’s Trumph” (the score’s triumphantly horn-filled closer) make clear just how mismatched Holter’s sensibilities are to this ultimately lazy and formulaic film, filled with scenes of sweaty gyms, casino floors, and other places of contest. Holter admirably writes music that attempts to complicate these spaces, but in the end she is mismatched with this film. And that’s a bummer, because any film would be lucky to have her contributions.  Holter’s work for Bleed for This is her first film score. Without a doubt her music will continue to appear in film because it is subtle, spectral, and densely packed with energy without being plodding or gaudy. Bleed for This like any run-of-the-mill white-elephant film vying for critical success is going to do away with those kinds of qualities, in order to activate base pleasures in a movie viewer. This film’s palette of emotions and events is only made of primary colors, while Holter’s music often exists in a spectrum that is murkier and less defined. The kind of film that Holter’s work may be suited for will more fluidly incorporate the hypnotic pace of her compositions. It will be a film that chooses not to retell the same story over and over again. \"],[22519,\" The story of the Men goes something like this: In 2011, the Brooklyn four-piece, led by guitarists and singers Mark Perro and Nick Chiericozzi, release Leave Home on Sacred Bones, the band’s second and first widely-available LP. Its strangely inviting blend of post-hardcore, noise-metal and shoegaze is a shot in the arm to the genre. The band’s profile rises. And then—surprisingly, inexorably—the Men ditch the art-punk game for classic-rock traditionalism over the course of three short years, embracing Tom Petty, the Band, and Crazy Horse for three often-brilliant records.  By 2014, the end of that initial prolific run, the Men (by then a quintet) had charted a straight path from indie rock's outer reaches (Leave Home) to its catchier, college-rock middle ground (2012’s near-perfect Open Your Heart) to something approaching dad rock for drunks (2013’s New Moon, 2014’s underrated Tomorrow’s Hits). In that time, the Men drove steadily away from noise and bombast toward harmonies and hooks, without entirely scrubbing away the grime that first defined them.Devil Music spins the car around 180 degrees and heads roaring back toward the psych-punk abandon of the Men’s early years. Released on the band’s own We Are the Men Records, and the crew’s first since parting ways with producer\\/multi-instrumentalist Ben Greenberg, the caustic, stubbornly lo-fi Devil Music sizzles like a hot coal—the Stooges, MC5, and Mudhoney compressed into an angry little ball. On first listen, the album’s nine tracks can sound a little half-baked, like the band simply set up some recording gear in their practice room and ran through a few songs they had yet to entirely finish. Which is pretty much what they did: The quartet tracked nearly everything on Devil Music, including vocals, live to 1\\/2-inch tape in their basement practice space over the course of a single weekend. Some of the lyrics were improvised on the spot. While the feral recording quality is certainly an asset, the songwriting isn’t as nuanced or well-considered as it is on their best tracks—“Open Your Heart,” “Half Angel Half Light,” “Different Days.” Lead-single “Lion’s Den”—in many ways the record’s mission statement—is a stumbling panic attack of screeching guitar, crashing cymbals, and skronking sax.So, yes, the melodies are harder to find. Though clearly that was the point: The Men weren’t trying to make a record you could sing along to. Devil Music is sweat, heat, and brute force above all. The song titles themselves suggest what the music does to your body: “Hit the Ground,” “Fire,” “Gun,” “Violate.” “Dreamer” is an amphetamine rush of Motörhead riffs and narcotized synths; the snarling, feedback-drenched guitars on “Violate” sound like they might rip through your chest, like Lou Reed’s paint-peeling solos on “I Heard Her Call My Name.” The Men sound exhausted by the urban grind, yet defiant. “I’m sick and tired of the city ’cause it gives me no place to hide,” Perro half-screams on “Fire.” On “Hit the Ground,” he vows to burn the whole place to the ground. Ragers are in the Men’s wheelhouse, and they pull these songs off with savage aplomb. The addition of that skronking sax, which pops up throughout the record, is a welcome addition to the Men’s manic sound. Few other bands display such a giddy, almost childlike enthusiasm for rock ‘n’ roll catharsis. And Devil Music is an endearing testament to that passion.Yet it’s disappointing that the Men felt compelled, for really the first time, to look backward. A band that built a legacy out of defying expectations and embracing a grab bag of genres for each new record—folk, classic rock, post-rock, noise, SST indie—returns to their scuzz-punk beginnings to make the most uniform album of their career. The Men are at their best when they’re testing the limits of their abilities, singing harmonies and writing hooks that wrench them out of their comfort zones. For all its wrath and fury, Devil Music feels safe and predictable. It’s a hell of a party, but it’s one we’ve been to before.\"],[22608,\"Since the late ’90s, Australian multi-instrumentalist Oren Ambarchi has composed drone metal and free jazz, sculpted ambient soundscapes and collaborated with many (if not most) of experimental music's biggest names. Over his prolific career, Ambarchi has toured with Sunn O))), played with Boris and Merzbow, drummed with Keiji Haino—and that's just a drop in the bucket. In many ways, Ambarchi is a quintessential musician’s musician: an adept drummer and guitarist, hugely respected within his own scene, whose fans study his work like stoned math majors pouring over a Mandelbrot set. Whether inspired by krautrock, metal, or jazz, Ambarchi’s work demands patience and attention, but along with his singular musicianship, Ambarchi's work reaches for the extremes of human experience, the sorrowful, the sublime.On his latest album, the three-part, forty-minute Hubris, Ambarchi teams up with an army of avant-garde musicians, among them Jim O’Rourke, Crys Cole, Keith Fullerton Whitman, Mark Fell, and Ricardo Villalobos. O’Rourke is a frequent collaborator with Ambarchi (together the two made 2011’s Indeed and last year’s Behold) and his presence is felt throughout the record. Both musicians are experts at locking into grooves, then breaking out of them in strange, unthinkable ways. On “Hubris Pt. 1,” Ambarchi lays down an arpeggiated guitar loop which serves as a baseline for his collaborators to play off and the track’s 22-minute runtime provides an ample canvas. According to Ambarchi, the composition was inspired by New Wave and disco—particularly Wang Chung’s soundtrack to the 1985 thriller To Live and Die in L.A.—but its sound and structure owe much to the patient loops of minimal techno. As with some forms of meditation, where practitioners are taught to focus on subtle differences in the body’s perception of the world, Ambarchi and his partners introduce ripples that swell into waves. While it's hard to parse who is responsible which sounds, O’Rourke's guitar-synth stands out, evoking retro graphics, John Carpenter soundtracks, and William Friedkin thrillers. Similar to the Field, Ambarchi’s loops instill a sense of wonder with their unflagging momentum, but while Axel Willner has a tendency toward big crescendos, “Pt. 1” stays rooted. Tension is heightened, but there's only a small release, just a fading sense that something beautiful is gone. “Pt. 3,” which includes contributions from Villalobos and DNA’s Arto Lindsay, is a different sort of beast—as unhinged and electric as anything Ambarchi has recorded. Villalobos, a godhead in the minimal techno arena, once sampled a small portion of Christian Vander’s “Baba Yaga La Sorciere,” turning it into 17 minutes of rhythmic ecstasy. Similarly, Villalobos, along with drummers Joe Talia and Will Guthrie, bring a circularity to “Pt. 3,” with Lindsay's guitar adding a no wave edge to the funk-prog undercurrent. Similarly, Villalobos, along with drummers Joe Talia and Will Guthrie, bring a similar circularity to “Pt. 3,” with Lindsay's guitar adding a no wave edge to the funk-prog undercurrent. Unlike “Pt. 1,” which stays within set confines, “Part 3” sheds formal constraints gleefully. By the time for Ambarchi’s guitars join Lindsay's, the track has become a maximalist hurricane of weird. Taken from a distance, Hubris is shaped something like an hourglass, with “Pt. 2” serving as a connector between the two halves. Tranquil guitar and sampled voices serve as an homage to Albert Marcoeur, a French art rocker known for sampling nursery rhymes, paints a pastoral picture. The track serves as a palette cleanser between the ethereal momentum of “Pt. 1” and the chaos of “Pt. 3.” It also puts a spotlight back on Ambarchi’s guitar, which is ostensibly what he is most famous for. In some ways “Pt. 2” is a synecdoche for Ambarchi himself. Few artists could assemble a group of musicians like that those found on Hubris at all, but Ambarchi lets everyone do their part, then fade into the background. It's the difference between hubris and vision. \"],[22573,\"The fourth full-length by Miami trio Jacuzzi Boys begins with frontman\\/guitarist Gabriel Alcala imagining a feeling of intoxication from leaving the house while carrying a knife: “These days, everything’s too nice\\/Walk around, it’s another day\\/Goin’ out with my lucky blade.” If he has an issue with things being too prettied-up for his liking, he still chose to express himself with a song drenched in a polished, edgeless sheen. And other than a stylized hint of violence, the song’s psychedelic pop exterior and trailing “oohs” leave us with no deeper an impression than a passing daydream.It’s not like Ping Pong’s sound de-fangs the passion of Jacuzzi Boys, but there’s certainly no sense of danger or even friction hidden in the album’s grooves. In strictly musical terms, Alcala’s smooth vocal facility gave him a “mature” aura early on in Jacuzzi Boys’ career. These days, he’s developed into a more-than-capable singer. The problem is when he asks, “Do you feel what I feel?\\/I feel it every day,” he doesn’t give us any inkling of what he’s feeling, nor does he really entice us to figure it out.If Alcala and his bandmates consider their music a kind of blade that protects them and serves as their sword against generic uniformity, they need to be more honest with themselves about how unthreatening their music actually is. The band’s name conjures images of party times in frothing hot tubs, but the music itself has a richness of mood that’s sold short by the band’s vacant imagery, which even had a hint of daft charm when Jacuzzi Boys were barely out of their teens. Now in their early-to-mid thirties, the subject matter has them sounding stuck.On “Can’t Fight Forever,” Alcala sings, “I don’t know how I really feel\\/Sometimes it’s really hard to feel,” over a slinking groove that bassist Danny Gonzales and drummer Diego Monasterios deliver with an impeccable balance of push and reserve. You can close your eyes and picture huge crowds bopping hard to the song, but the resignation that underpins and deflates it is actually alarming. “Sometimes, when I’m not fine,” Alcala continues, “I go looking for a cool time\\/Waking up is a such a trip\\/Like the sound of a hard whip.”It’s just that Alcala sounds no more impassioned singing about attraction than he does about antifreeze. When he manages to deliver lines that at least have the potential to intrigue or provoke—“Girls like love and boys like blood” is a phrase Gonzales would repeat to his mother as a child—he and the band squander that potential by making you feel as if their understanding of human behavior derives entirely from 1980s music videos.Jacuzzi Boys started trading-in their traditionalist garage-rock approach for slickness with their second album, 2011’s Glazin. At times, they’ve come close to straight synthpop. But they’ve navigated that change without actually watering down their music—something so many other bands have failed at. Not unlike the Dandy Warhols did over a three-album run from 1997 to 2003, Jacuzzi Boys have already proven they can keep their feet in guitar-driven rock and pop while maintaining their balance, which would suggest ample possibilities for future work.Unfortunately, their sun-zapped slacker outlook drags them back, miscasting themselves as a modern-day answer to hollow, overly attitude-conscious acts like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. They don’t have to. As a rock band swimming against Miami’s dance and Latin currents, surely they have more interesting stories they can tell us. Their own music deserves it.  \"],[22609,\"Hudson Mohawke does drama better than most. His drums move with the heft of a cruiserweight boxer—powerful but lithe, kicks and snares leaving dents where they land. His rhythms come from trap, but his atmospheres couldn't be further than that genre’s grimy, boarded-up noir: His music positively glistens with chimes and arpeggios, and his monumental horn fanfare suggests armor-plated legions battering down castle doors, or angels raving at the pearly gates.Those contradictions have made him one of the most interesting producers in pop music. His beats stud songs by Kanye, Drake, and Pusha T like luxurious expanses of diamond pavé, brilliant yet still rough to the touch. And working alongside Daniel Lopatin, aka Oneohtrix Point Never, he provided Anohni’s HOPELESSNESS with a harrowing fusion of liturgical gravitas and Hollywood blockbuster. (Despite having been labeled a maximalist, he knows when to get the hell out of the way, and the restraint he brings to Anohni’s album only serves to highlight her own larger-than-life presence.)There’s no lack of drama in his soundtrack to Ded Sec - Watch Dogs 2, which is good: It is, after all, an action-adventure open-world video game about hackers and global corruption, in which spectacular acts of anti-establishment violence play out against the backdrop of San Francisco and the Silicon Valley. HudMo’s music is a natural fit, and he brings his most effective tricks to the table: heart-in-mouth trombone blasts, blindingly bright synthesizer melodies, bruising drums. His customary sound set—a mixture of obviously synthesized brass with simulacral acoustic instruments like harpsichord and piano—complements the uncanny valley of the game world, a painstaking recreation of various Bay Area neighborhoods. If anything, he frequently upends expectations for video-game soundtracks by tilting away from purely electronic textures. Elegiac piano, strings, and choir give the opening “Shanghaied” a feel like John Williams gone trap. Loping Afro-Cuban percussion rounds out the giddily maximalist “Play N Go,” and the symphonic percussion of the regal “Haum Sweet Haum” is faintly reminiscent of Hans Zimmer’s score for Inception.Ded Sec probably shouldn’t be considered a proper follow-up to last year’s Lantern, but it actually holds up favorably in that regard. With a mixture of full-length tracks and minute-long sketches, it’s nicely varied. The short, shimmering ambient study “W4tched (Cinema)” suggests that the producer may have picked up a trick or two from Oneohtrix Point Never during their time together working on Anohni’s album, and OPN’s influence also hangs over the gorgeous, light-speed “Cyber Driver,” with its R2D2 chirps and space-elevator arps. “Amethyst” pairs dial-tone synths and horror-movie organs with scissor-handed snare-and-hi-hat acrobatics in a way that makes even the most hackneyed trap tropes feel vibrant—no easy task. And on the short, kinetic “Balance,” he continually keeps you guessing as to where the downbeat will land; his tricky programming, playing triplets off constantly shifting syncopations, reveals him as one of the most rhythmically interesting producers out there right now.In fact, despite the omnipresence of his customary blare, what might be most interesting here are the nuances that he brings to the table. In “Eye for an Eye (Reprise),” a quiet sketch for FM synths, he strips away the drums to let us see just how dexterous his timbral touch is, every note a jewel-toned liquid explosion. Before “Watch Dogs Theme” builds to its expected climax, with buzzing chords firing like illuminated jets of water, he rolls out a curious, elliptical drum pattern that seems to be pulling itself apart at the seams. Like many of the most interesting moments on Ded Sec, the real action is happening just beneath the surface of all those shiny things. It’s enough to make you wonder what a shadowier, more minimalist Hudson Mohawke might sound like. We’ve basked in the glow of his rockets’ red glare; what would it be like to taste their acrid soot?\"],[22605,\"Since July alone the former Das Racist member Kool A.D. has released more music than some artists do during their entire careers; September’s Peyote Karaoke was not Kool’s first but second 100-track project of the year (and including last year’s O.K., his third in less than 365 days). The common thread between these releases has been a sense of musical restlessness, and most of acted as folios for his omnivorous appetite. Have a Nice Dream, his eighth project of 2016, continues this trend of zooming in on one particular sound—or, in this case, less a formal style than a general and overarching mood.A reflective and meditative release, Have a Nice Dream luxuriates in an off-kilter wooziness. Opener “Who Am I?”—the lone contribution from Bay Area beatmaker Trackademicks, who handled all of the production on August’s ode to hyphy Official—features dramatic strings, over which Kool A.D. guides himself through an existential crisis. Part ontological investigation and part braggadocio session, it’s vintage Kool A.D.: “Just like the leg on a centipede, everything’s everything\\/Look at my wings so feathery, look at my energy.” Kool’s vocals are slathered in layers of effects, creating the sensation of a hundred internal voices battling for prominence. Even so, it’s the most straightforward track on the EP.“Who Am I?” also holds the distinction of being the only song where the primary draw is Kool A.D.’s rapping. “Just Like Magic” is a breezy electro-pop trifle as viewed through a funhouse mirror: a little goofy, its proportions exaggerated to near-comical level, and pleasantly disorienting. But its lack of structure gives it an amorphous first-draft quality that’s hard to shake. Kool A.D.’s collaboration with Francis and the Lights, the unhurried “It’s Alright 2 Cry,” boasts the most shape of anything on Have a Nice Dream, and it works because Kool manages to inject some irreverence into the self-seriousness that sometimes plagues solo Francis and the Lights material.Kool A.D. is, after all, the kind of dude who opens a song titled “America Is Dead” by melodically singing “Swag swag\\/Bieber.” It’s this sort of no-fucks-given approach that lets him conclude the project with a straight-faced ambient track that stretches out for 32 minutes. Less “My First Ambient Song” than would might expect, the EP’s centerpiece drags on about ten minutes too long, but the title track’s first two-thirds do a good job of conjuring the kind of dread someone like Andy Stott is known for, albeit with a less suffocating (and less polished) lurch. It’s representative of Have a Nice Dream as a whole: expectedly unexpected, surprisingly effective if meandering, and decidedly low-stakes.\"],[22606,\"When Systems\\/Layers, the fifth album by Louisville stalwarts Rachel’s, dropped in 2003, it seemed they’d broken through. Elevating their compositions from lovely postmodern takes on classical music to a unique strain of orchestral post-rock, Systems\\/Layers featured a truly synthesized mesh of chamber music and electronics that sounded like little else. Alas, as Rachel’s had always been more project than band, a period of inactivity followed the record while members worked on other things, and then cofounder Jason Noble fell ill to cancer, dying in 2012. As a result, Systems\\/Layers remains their final statement, whether or not they’d intended it as such.In the thirteen years that have passed since that record came out, the little nook of a genre which Rachel’s helped birth—classical sounds with indie sensibilities, film-music moodiness and digital experimentation—has grown into a more easily identifiable vein of music couched under the umbrella term “post-classical” (a term that used to refer to minimalists like Steve Reich and Philip Glass, who modern audiences might likely just see as “20th-century classical”). Promoted by labels like 130701 and Erased Tapes and typified by the commercially successful and recognized soundtrack work of Jóhann Jóhannsson, Max Richter, and Ólafur Arnalds, as well as up-and-coming artists like Resina or Emilie Levienaise-Farrouch, post-classical is now a small but thriving world. And Systems\\/Layers’ status as a godfather record to the nascent genre is undeniable.Now the band and their label Quarterstick have finally seen fit to capitalize on these recent trends by issuing the beloved Systems\\/Layers for the first time on vinyl, their only record not to have had such a release. Though it isn’t common for thirteen-year-old records by small bands to be reissued without a label change, the CD-only Systems\\/Layers had entered a kind of a quasi out-of-print status as listeners move to a vinyl-and-streaming binary. Thankfully, the small label Quarterstick has leapt in to rectify the situation.It’s also a fitting tribute to the departed Noble, whose sensibility rings out of Systems\\/Layers. Each of the five Rachel’s records has a unique voice, guided mostly by which members of the collective had greater hands in the songwriting. Handwriting and Sea and Bells were cowritten by all three core principals—Rachel Grimes, Jason Noble and Christian Frederickson—while Egon Schiele was entirely written by Grimes and Noble’s role was reduced to production. Systems\\/Layers, with its postmodern merger of music and technology, sounds closer to Noble’s later solo work as Per Mission than anything else in Rachel’s catalog.Fans who haven’t listened to Systems\\/Layers in years may be pleased to learn that like all Rachel’s records, it doesn’t sound like it’s aged a day and could just as easily be taken as a new release from 130701. Part of this is due to the engineering and mixing talents of Shellac’s Bob Weston, who guides the band toward a sound that is naturalistic and in-the-hall. On tracks like “Esperanza” or “Packet Switching,” the violins swell and soar so high it feels as if you're looking up at the ceiling from the orchestra level of a concert hall.Which, to be fair, may have actually been where the sounds were recorded, as much of the album was recorded live with the SITI Company dance troupe in places like Skidmore College and Indiana University Southeast for a performance piece sharing the same name. The exact nature of the compositional relationship with SITI is unclear, but all of Systems\\/Layers has a blended, ephemeral feel that feels more like a 60-minute sound experiment than the collection of discrete compositions that made up previous records. Many of the cuts—even the more traditional Satie-esque solo piano of “Anytime Soon” or the darting “Arterial”—end or begin with crossfading segues from adjacent tracks. And many of them depart standard structures entirely, such as “where_have_all_my_files_gone?,” which would sound completely at home on Jóhannsson’s latest Orphee, threading an encircling wall of strings into a throbbing synth burble before transitioning into “Reflective Surfaces,” which blends gamelan and voice samples into a cacophonous churn. And on “Last Things Last” the band finally incorporates actual singing (with a guest appearance from Shannon Wright) in a track that in context feels like an intriguing change of pace despite its relative slightness as a stand-alone track.Best of all are “Water from the Same Source” and “Air Conditioning.” The former offers a stately six-minute representation of Rachel’s formula: gently circulating strings, piano, bass and rock(ish) drumming. It has been featured already in such films as Hancock and La Grande Bellezza and it’s easy to imagine it finding a permanent life soundtracking moments of contemplative emotional transition in film. “Air Conditioning” follows a similar script but is even more condensed: three minutes of nagging, heart-tugging strings via a repeated droning viola riff and soaring violin and cello, before melting away into a hazy fog of samples and found sounds. One thing that distinguishes Systems\\/Layers from its modern peers is its unpretentious woolliness, which stands in stark contrast to the grandeur-seeking impulses of Jóhannsson and Richter. There’s a charming innocence and gentle defiance that imbues their music with a modest magic, one that also makes it more comprehensible why the band has remained on the margins. The reissue wraps by including the band’s final release from 2005, the eighteen-minute outtake collage “Technology Is Killing Music,” which is slotted neatly as the whole of Side 4. Made up entirely of bits of song and sound from the recording of Systems\\/Layers, it serves as a nice companion to that record and a perfect endpoint for the band, framing a true blueprint for late 2000s and 2010s post-classical. Additionally, the decision to add it rather than stretch out a sixty-minute record onto four LP sides is a generous and welcome choice, allowing listeners to avoid the subtly annoying problem of “2XLP vinyl reissues” requiring an overabundance of record flipping.It’s uncertain if Rachel’s will ever receive the broad recognition they deserve as forebearers of a vibrant and essential new genre of 21st century music, but it may be that Noble, their easy-going and dearly departed leader, may not have cared either way. For a group who knowingly produced expensive, hand-crafted vinyl packaging for records they knew only a small group of people would buy, sharing their music was always a labor of care and love and provided a kind of satisfaction in and of itself. At least now, it’s all out there.\"],[22502,\"It’s hard to calculate just how pervasive Helmet founder Page Hamilton’s influence has been, but at one point during the mid-90’s it seemed as if his footprints were all over the heavy metal and alt-rock landscape. You could make a strong case that there are traces of Hamilton’s style in the music of Tool, the Deftones, and even the likes of Weezer and the Smashing Pumpkins. Helmet’s reach makes sense given that the band's career arc traversed multiple scenes in a short time. Starting out with one foot in New York’s avant-garde sphere following Hamilton’s tenures with Glenn Branca and Band of Susans, Helmet’s earliest releases on the iconic indie label Amphetamine Reptile in ’89-’90 landed them in the middle of a burgeoning underground wave that included other cult acts like Cows, Killdozer, Today Is the Day, and others. Along the way, Helmet also became associated with the artier side of New York’s hardcore and post-hardcore circles alongside Quicksand and Orange 9mm. Metal audiences—and bands like Sepultura and Pantera —embraced them as well. By 1994, Helmet found themselves in the thick of the alternative rock zeitgeist as their video for “Milktoast,” their contribution to The Crow soundtrack, scored heavy rotation on MTV. And just prior to the band’s breakup in the late ’90s, Helmet toured with Korn and Limp Bizkit. Hamilton’s hypnotic, earworm-like riffs have a way of instantly getting under your skin and sticking to your brain like gum. So does the grooving but strangely counter-intuitive approach to rhythm that sets the band's sound apart to this day. So it’s easy to see why Helmet's signature style rubbed off so readily on other bands. In fact, it's hard to imagine Meshuggah or the Dillinger Escape Plan evolving the way they did without Hamilton’s proto math-metal vocabulary to build on. But in spite of his master’s degree in jazz composition, Hamilton imposed a rigid, primitivistic structural frame on Helmet’s music that he's never completely broken free of. Most of the time, he hasn't really tried. Not unlike Guided By Voices mastermind Bob Pollard, Hamilton has more or less recycled the same formula for Helmet’s entire career, insisting on defining the band by its limits even long after it was creatively expedient to do so—shocking when you consider that, in his time away from Helmet, Hamilton played with Bowie and Joe Henry, nearly joined Wire, and worked on film scores with composer Elliot Goldenthal. The good news is that Hamilton takes more chances than he ever has on Dead to the World, the band's eighth studio album and fourth since Hamilton re-launched the Helmet brand with a revolving cast of side musicians. Things start out promisingly enough when, on album opener “Life or Death,” Hamilton manages to find the elusive middle ground between the tinny grain of the band’s early (and recent) non-album singles and the lush, pumped-up-for-airplay tone of the first Helmet 2.0 album, 2004’s Size Matters. Hamilton also explores melody more fearlessly than ever. On “Bad News,” he nods at Revolver-era Beatles. And the title track might be the most layered and spacious of anything Hamilton's ever released under the Helmet name, with its somber cello occupying a prominent place in the mix. Strings play a key role on the eerie “Expect the World” as well. Meanwhile, “Look Alive,” with its haunting vocal line, is arguably the first time that a Helmet tune has conveyed genuine pathos. And when Hamilton slows down and reprises \\\\\"Life or Death\\\\\" at the end of the album, you can make out the harmonic fabric of his chords more clearly than ever before. But the Elvis Costello cover “Green Shirt,” his attempt at spry pop, lands too close to the ill-conceived hard rock bubblegum of Lita Ford’s “Kiss Me Deadly” to make sense as a Helmet tune. Going all the way back to 1994’s Betty—Helmet's only other album with genuine variation —Hamilton proved that he was actually capable of introducing melody into the band's vocabulary without dulling its edge. Hamilton may have started out as a barking vocalist, but he developed into a tunesmith at a time when he was still coming up with vital, intricate riffs. Both Betty and 1997’s Aftertaste contain examples of Hamilton ingeniously weaving vocals and riffs together, expanding while also staying true to Helmet’s core sound.Try, for example, to sing a song like “It's Easy to Get Bored” while playing (or even air-guitaring) the rhythm guitar part without tripping up. In such cases, Hamilton’s experimental instincts and songwriting acumen came together seamlessly. That doesn't happen nearly enough on Dead to the World, where too much of the material stumbles in a confused attempt to marry Hamilton’s increasingly generic pop sensibilities with the savagery of classic-era Helmet. The two elements don’t gel, and both sound forced.Longtime fans will recognize touches of that old Helmet magic in songs like “Red Scare” and “Die Alone,” with its spiraling riff and 3-on-4 rhythm that's long been one of the band's most recognizable hallmarks. But Hamilton has undeniably lost some of the touch that captivated his audience the first time around. Up ‘til the band's breakup in ’98, Hamilton's elliptical lyrics were marked by an intellectual distance that created a rich space between the words and the music—and, crucially, separated Helmet from the glut of their angst- and rage-driven peers.Since 2004, Hamilton has written more openly about relationships, which might have added texture to the music if his lyrics weren't so painfully one-sided and mean-spirited. Not to mention that he continues to attack New Age ideals, as he did all the way back on the early non-LP track “Shirley MacLaine.” To still be harping on the same topic almost 30 years later points to an alarming lack of growth and self-awareness. At least back then, the quirks in Hamilton's lyrics gave them character.Now, when he growls embarrassing lines like “Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!” at the end of “I <3 My Guru,” Hamilton just comes off like an aging, bitter misanthrope with no substance to offer in place of vacuity that still bothers him so much. (Try moving out of L.A., maybe?) Lyrics aside, the elephant in the room on any latter-day Helmet release is the absence of founding drummer John Stanier. Before Stanier re-invented himself as an agile, polyrhythm-juggling finesse player in Battles, he was basically a one-trick pony whose ultra-tight snare crack became as integral to Helmet's sound as Hamilton's riffs.Stanier's brute simplicity provided the yin to Hamilton's yang, and the band hasn't really been the same since his departure. It's encouraging to see Hamilton reaching for new modes of expression on Dead to the World. Ultimately, though, after making such an indelible and unique contribution to the language of modern heavy rock, Hamilton continues to show that he's hemmed-in by the style he invented.\"],[22582,\"Alicia Keys is a creature of habit when it comes to her music. With “Piano and I,” the first track on her hugely successful debut album Songs in A Minor, she started the tradition of opening her albums with a clearly marked intro. Although the format varied—wordless classical compositions, piano-backed spoken-word pieces, a short poem—these intros generally served two purposes: reminding us of her piano chops and elucidating her state of mind during the recording process. If you study a person’s habits enough, a picture of who they are should start to emerge. Yet HERE, Keys’ sixth studio album, does little to further our understanding of who Keys is.“The Beginning (Interlude),” HERE’s opener, sets the scene for the album to work as a series of extended metaphors. So when Keys says “I’m the musical to the project fables\\/I’m the words scratched out on the record label\\/I’m the wind when the record spins\\/I’m the dramatic static before the song begins,” you don’t need to take it literally. Instead, by personifying hip-hop, she is performing the first of several shifts in narrative perspective.It helps to take this into consideration early on, so that it’s not entirely confusing when Keys starts singing from the perspective of a 29-year-old addict on “Illusion of Bliss.” Or on “Kill Your Mama,” where she takes on the role of spokesperson for all of Mother Earth’s wayward children, piling the platitudes onto a simple guitar melody: “Is there any savin’ us\\/We’ve become so dangerous\\/Is there any change in us\\/Even for the sake of love.” Still, this is an Alicia Keys record, and it wouldn’t be wrong to expect her to devote time to herself. There are only three tracks on which you could safely guess that she is giving any insight into her world. “Work on It” is a look just beneath the surface at a relationship that takes, well, work— but the intrigue is lacking, even with production from the usually unflappable Pharrell Williams. “Girl Can’t Be Herself” is surely the anthem for her makeup-free movement and, by her own admission, a tool for working through some of the insecurities that she tackles in the lyrics. “Blended Family (What You Do For Love)” rolls along as an earnest-but-slightly-awkward song about the dynamic within her home, before getting completely sabotaged by a throwaway verse from guest A$AP Rocky.HERE is punctuated with interludes that feature recordings of candid discussions between Keys and her friends including, reportedly, Nas. It seems unjust that these brief appearances spark more curiosity about the speakers than the songs that refer directly to the artist with top billing, and the rest of the tracks do little to address this balance—at least from a lyrical standpoint.To her credit, she flexes some surprising dexterity, moving easily between ballads and more uptempo beats and varying her delivery to occasionally take on a rapper’s cadence, for example on “The Gospel.” She’s probably not about to rebrand herself as a spitter, but the piano melody textured by a stuttering drum pattern works well. The drum programming comes courtesy of Harold Lilly, while songwriting and production duties fell largely to Mark Batson and Swizz Beatz, who left no traces of his signature sound. Along with Keys the four form a production group called The ILLuminaries, and they prove on several occasions how the hivemind approach to beatmaking can pay off.The rhythms on HERE represent a departure from her previous efforts and indicate a willingness to experiment with her sound but the lyrics, which rarely betray a sense of adventure, cancel out most of this good work. While it might not mean much in the age of streaming, there is something particularly confounding about the decision to relegate the most exciting lead single (“In Common”) to a bonus track on the deluxe edition, when the rest of the album didn’t quite follow through on the song’s promise. Alicia Keys has worked hard to build up enough name recognition; she can tick off multiple successes after several years in the game; she has earned the right to throw caution to the wind. It’s hard to shake the feeling that this record was a missed opportunity to do so.\"],[22604,\"At first, Topaz Jones sounds like the sort of young, positive-thinking emcee who should pay tithes to Chance the Rapper on an annual basis. But repeated listens to the 23-year-old New York rapper’s Arcade reveal the intricacy and subtleties of Jones—he’s not the earnest pup sniffing around your ankles, but a fully formed personality, an approachable everyman rapper who’s more Oddisee and Open Mike Eagle than Vic Mensa.Jones’ persona is enriched by a deep love of old funk and soul music (his father Curtis played guitar for the influential band Slave), and he frequently uses live instrumentation. “Grass (Survivor’s Guilt)” transitions from light adult-contemporary guitar to thudding boom-bap, mashing together conflicting thoughts in the same way Jones weaves a love song into a thought about romance as a “great distraction from checking the evening news and staying up on what’s happening.”“Tropicana” occupies the same fleet-footed space as other intoxicating, breezy singles from this year, like Joey Purp’s “Girls @” and Amine’s “Caroline.” But Jones manages to weave details and asides in the lyrics that require repeated, close listens (it also proves he’s more than capable of double-time raps and old-school flows). “He killing but you still say, ‘free my bro,’ truth be told he should do his time\\/but hey that’s another song,” he offers casually, hinting at a larger world than he has time to get to inside a two-and-a-half minute toe-tapper. It’s a reminder of the potency that a flighty, sub-three minute rap song can contain, and the depths rap often plunders through beats that fill floors with joyous dancing bodies.Jones is also an excellent hook writer, transforming the fantasy of the funky “Powerball” with a gospel-hued, reality-crashing bridge of: “What’s going on\\/nothing but the rent, nothing but the rent, nothing but the rent.” The song's cheeky “what if I won the lottery” concept is fleshed out by his chuckling reminiscence: “I graduated all they gave me was a piece of paper\\/no ‘good job’\\/no goodbye\\/not even ‘see you later.’” The humanity of the moment is telling: How else could you expect to “move up” in life without the aide of the lotto, while dealing with the quotidian reality that education rarely provides a pragmatic leg-up?The piano ballad “Untitled” showcases his soulful voice, framing the song as a declaration to his mother he’s moving out while sneaking a tender autobiography. He calls back to this “hidden track” a few songs later, trading the piano for guitar (again, no drums) and offering a few more personal details: “My prom date just got engaged, I’m happy for you Marissa\\/that night in June I was probably just too nervous to kiss you,” he sighs, seconds after noting the colors of his childhood home were painted as the house gets put on the market. These moments are affecting because they are the work of an empathetic writer—he gives everyone in his stories autonomy: Jones has searched himself for the story and held onto the moments he thinks matter, not merely assumed he is the story. With Arcade, he makes you a part of the story, too.\"],[22585,\"Gaika Tavares is from the south London neighborhood of Brixton. It is a heterogeneous immigrant neighborhood endemic of the city’s rapid pace of gentrification. Just this year, protests erupted after a cluster of small businesses along the area’s railway hub were presented with sharp rent increases. Gaika returned to Brixton from art school just as the face of the neighborhood began to change. He notes, in an interview with the Fader, that the schizophrenic logic of real estate development would place an artisanal grocery store across the street from a housing project. That image in itself, while increasingly common throughout the globe, still feels like some anachronism playing itself out, as if the future of the neighborhood was flipping off its past.In just the last two years, Gaika’s been busy archiving this experience of local change into defiantly industrial and viscerally uncomfortable music. His self-released mixtape Machine and his sophomore release Security (for Dre Skull’s Mixpak label) were the building blocks for a musical identity that he has called “ghetto futurism.” In each, he’s honed his blood-curdling howl and hypnotic patois into a sophisticated weapon he uses to castigate the milquetoast evil of the Queen’s government. He is not exactly a rapper, hewing closer to a dancehall deejay (in the style of Popcaan or Vybz Kartel), but the riddims he chooses to “toast” to are startlingly hybrid. He simultaneously borrows from the opiated beats of Clams Casino, the futurist dancehall of Rizzla, the industrial sneer of Death Grips, and the digital discomfort of Objekt or Amnesia Scanner, combining them into a slippery and metallic iteration of unique dance music. His latest release, Spaghetto (and his first for Warp) is a protean collection of eight songs that Tavares has described as his reggae lovers rock record. Opening with “Neophyte,” he displays a new liturgical aspect to his sound. There is nearly a minute of humming, ambient static, and clouds of hisses before he enters the scene. It renders the entire vibe of the album far more gothic than any of his previous releases and allows himself to widen the scope of his sound and subject matter. In “Neophyte,” he considers the ways in which the black body has been pathologized by racist theology: “We're insecure in this image of God,” he says, and repeats with desperate urgency a warning about the shared vulnerability that creates: “Don't you know they'll break your body?\\/Don't you know they'll take your body?” He’s joined by Leila Adu, whose chorus (“Feelin' so raw\\/Livin' in these times\\/Oh, raw, so”) gives the track gospel-like feel. In fact, Gaika creates his version of lovers rock by weaving electronic gospel into his dystopian sound. He manipulates his voice in different ways, dropping his howl for a syrupy and sometimes shaky singing voice, and relies on the help of female vocalists. He resides mostly in the background of “The Deal” complementing the singer Alyusha with sharp lines (“It's the deal that we made in blood\\/And it's written on your skin”). It almost sounds like a knockoff Kelela track, but Gaika's voice is such a weird instrument. It can be goofy and melancholic, almost recalling Lil B. He adds a tinge of goth sad-boy to his production that can soften the acidic dystopian vibe he usually works under, like on “Glad We Found It,” where he relies on a strangely tantric whisper that is overly earnest but lovable. It would almost be more interesting he if sung more songs with his inimitable howl. When he does, like in songs like “3D,” his screed on gentrification and cold city politics feels more forceful and intimate. That said, Spaghetto is a strong EP from an artist who is surely going to release something even more wondrous variable and strange. He might not have the range, but he does sure have an intelligent sense of adventure and experimentation. Perhaps his music works so well because of its hybridity: mixing dancehall into German techno into gospel into stuff that sounds like Yeezus, all so powerfully. As Homi Bhabha theorized in regards to colonization, hybridity in cultural expression was an essential form of subversion on the part of the colonized and the oppressed. Gaika, like say, Elysia Crampton, is able to fuse vernacular forms into the sounds of popular culture in ways that are pleasurably disruptive and undeniably in your face.  \"],[22560,\"Michael Berdan has a brawler’s voice, spittle-flecked and dissolute. Those nagging vocals seized center stage on Perfect World, the blistering 2015 debut LP from Uniform, Berdan’s duo with multi-instrumentalist Ben Greenberg. Theirs was a marriage made in industrial-punk Hades, draping righteous pique over a grind lashed together from guitar groan and staple-gun electronics. Over the course of six songs—capped by churning, spoken-word downer “Learning to Forget”—the NYC-based pair forged a bracing, singular sound as strong as its Bad Religion-esque logo, strong enough to sustain a cult career.With Ghosthouse, Berdan and Greenberg demonstrate a healthy willingness to interrogate and even upend that sound. The duo’s core certainly remains in place: that punishing glower, that pounding thump, those declamations. But as the title track convulses, it is overwhelmed by a smear of effects, a mutation that might have sat in the background on their first album suddenly assuming center stage. Crazed Sabbath cover “Symptom of the Universe” represents Ghosthouse’s most significant departure. Thundering pop-metal riffs cement the song’s melodic backbone, ultimately exploding into the kind of frenzied, epic soloing that fell out of mainstream favor a decade back; effects skitter and sizzle at the margins, while Berdan’s chants are yanked backwards through vocal filters. Rob Zombie and Mastodon may be the last touchstones you expect to encounter on a Uniform record, yet they apply here. This, after all, is what the EP format is truly for: to bravely dip a toe into the unknown, to strain a bit against the boundaries of what listeners have come to expect. Sophomore LP Wake In Fright arrives early next year; we know, now, to anticipate anything and everything.\"],[22589,\"Bret Easton Ellis recently said if he were to rewrite American Psycho for modern times, he’d change the setting from late-’80s New York to today’s Silicon Valley, and his psychotic anti-hero Patrick Bateman would haunt the offices of a startup. In this updated version, Bateman probably spends his weekends cruising through Northern California in his Tesla Roadster for getaways to Napa, and presumably makes regular trips to Burning Man. As he drives his sports car with wanton abandon, the speakers rumbling with bass, I like to imagine he’s listening to the lite-EDM duo the Chainsmokers. On some balmy day somewhere in the Valley, he has perhaps downloaded their latest release, Collage EP, onto his smartphone to enjoy at his leisure. And he is listening to them not only because everyone in the country is (they’ve dominated the Billboard chart this year with three songs in the top 10, each for multiple weeks on end), but because the DJs Drew Taggart and Alex Pall, on a fundamental level, would be his people: bros in the prime of life, and caricatures of society’s most reviled. If charts are the most reliable reflection of who the most powerful artists in the country are, the Chainsmokers are without a doubt kings of the hill. Yet, unlike any of their peers, even in the world of festival-ready EDM, Pall and Taggart have lent their full-throated support to the tech-bro lifestyle and all its connotations. They speak in the garbled lingo of “iterating” and “disrupting” culture. They preview bits and pieces of songs on Snapchat, and use Hype Machine as a market research tool to hone in on an audience. They wonder aloud about the “return-on-investment” and “reach” their relationship with the press warrants. When networking with Calvin Harris, they say they “basically brain-raped him” with their inquiries and curiosity.Yet, they don’t want you to forget they are red-blooded males. As Pall so lovably admits: “Even before success, pussy was number one.” Taggart famously beefed with Lady Gaga and Halsey on Twitter, unleashing a casual flurry of misogyny in his wake (later claiming he was hacked). On their website, a bio provided by them proudly reads the Chainsmokers are “17.34 combined inches” (the measurement of their penises measured from tip to tip). Taggart lists “Entourage”’s manic Ari Gold as an inspiration, but they also want to be seen as “curators,” “creators,” and “nerds.” All of this is to say, they have painted themselves as hilariously repugnant and horribly fascinating all at once. Moral turpitude and coarse language withstanding, they are still massively popular, and they themselves are not on trial—the music they make is. With Collage, they paint a photorealist portrait of their manspread over the charts. Collage conveniently collects the group’s biggest from the year, and each of these songs works on a finely tuned algorithm. The recipe for a Chainsmokers song is basically two parts airy hook, one part lilting female vocal, and a few dashes of saccharine melancholy and sugary synths. Aesthetically they are close cousins to Calvin Harris’ poptronica and Kygo’s soporific trop-house, but their song structure borrows from forebears like Deadmau5 and Avicii. They’ll still use drops, but they have softened the edge of that serotonin spike by highlighting choruses and melody in pastel color. It makes their music instantly familiar and malleable, and thus radio-friendly. Take “Closer,” for example, their biggest song and a duet between Drew Taggart and the alt-pop singer Halsey. The song derives its power from a sleek and simple chord progression that mirrors the song’s chorus (“We ain’t never getting older”), and borrows heavily from the Fray’s mid-2000s soft-banger “Over My Head.” The chord progression reinforces the chorus, as if it were humming behind Taggart in unison. The song’s narrative is relatable and anthemic but intimate-sounding: A man meets an ex at a party, hooks up, but then remembers why he hated her in the first place. The millennial populism of the lyrics (“Stay and play that Blink-182 song\\/That we beat to death in Tucson, okay”) make the track feel manically personal. Add in a little bit of sneering class resentment and conspicuous consumption (“So, baby, pull me closer\\/In the backseat of your Rover\\/That I know you can’t afford”) and you’ve got a giant hit on your hands. It’s undeniable—powerfully catchy and easy to whistle, with a light veneer of sad-boy sweetness covering EDM’s biting aggression.Elsewhere they are more faceless, feeding off of the energy that a series of female vocalists gives to their tracks. Alex Pall has said that his main function in the group is as A&R, booking guests for individual songs and tailoring each one to fit a different demographic. With Daya, they crudely masquerade as the xx in “Don’t Let Me Down,” and (in their parlance) put forward “LMFAO with better clothes” in “Inside Out” (featuring Charlee). In each case, they find a different route to the reptilian brain, stripping back the McMansion architecture of an EDM song and redecorating with items procured from Anthropologie.Perhaps, what is most interesting about the Chainsmokers is the cynicism of their approach. Their music is essentially an accretion of trends, a packet of market research. EDM’s boom-and-bust cycle has come to an end, and they’ve weathered the drought, presenting themselves as part of a lovably hateable lifestyle brand that grips the nation’s young and powerful. One thing about cynics is they tend to survive, and Chainsmokers seem engineered above all for survival.\"],[22584,\"Tyvek have been going for over a decade, and at different points throughout the Detroit punks’ tenure, at least 22 people have counted among their ranks. Kevin Boyer’s voice, guitar, collaged cover artwork, and lyrics have always been at the band’s center, but he’s quick to point out the obvious—that each contributing member brings something unique to the table. “Tyvek is always changing,” Boyer told Maximum Rocknroll. “There’s always a period of relearning, half-retracing our steps, but we always find ourselves in a different place from where we left off.” They change their approach semi-regularly, but they don’t sound like a brand-new band with every release.The band’s sound is fairly well-defined. It’s loud punk music, guided by Boyer’s shouted abstract poems. Sometimes the songs are faster, sometimes they’re more anthemic, sometimes they’re choppy, and sometimes they’re all over the place. It really depends on who’s playing. Beyond the more visible albums and singles released by bigger indie labels, they’ve put out piles of CDRs and tapes. Then there’s the sprawl of music released by the members’ other bands. Mountains and Rainbows and the Intended, for example, both had strong debut albums arrive this year. Members of Protomartyr and Saturday Looks Good to Me have played in Tyvek. The list goes on like that for a while. Tyvek’s new album Origin of What is an acknowledgement of the band’s history; it features seven musicians from across the band’s lineups. Every new song shuffles the players, and other than Boyer, the only constant is Fred Thomas, who recorded the album and drums on 10 of the 12 tracks. Thomas and Boyer go way back: Thomas recorded a 2002 Boyer solo project, and more recently, worked on Tyvek’s On Triple Beams. These two anchors become important when Origin of What weaves between slower, paced material and all-out bashers. The opening two tracks “Tip to Tail” and “Can’t Exist” fall at the rowdier end of the spectrum, showing Tyvek at the height of their kinetic earworm powers. It’s also a one-two that shows a huge range in guitar tone—bleary echoing guitars linger in the background of the former while the latter is all crunch and distortion.The faster, punchier stuff is counterbalanced by songs like “Origin of What”—a six-minute track with a more gradual, dense tread that addresses U.S. Steel and the decline of the Euro. Boyer has talked about the importance of the “subtle tics” in Tyvek songs, which is true—details and texture are always key to the character of their records. There's a moment on “Choose Once” when a once-prominent vocal is suddenly swallowed beneath the song’s huge primary guitar line, as if Boyer’s mic was kicked over. Then there’s “Tyvek Chant,” a song comprised of repeated screams and guitars that seem to come through an AM radio feed, abstracted by crackles and fuzz. Several pieces on Origin of What show that the Tyvek operation is generally more subtle than their shout-along, high-speed rock‘n’roll masterworks might suggest. “Underwater Three Dub” is the most gentle point of the record—a collaboration between Boyer, Thomas, and Shelley Salant (who makes spacey, hypnotic instrumental guitar records under the name Shells). While this melody floats and shimmers, Boyer sings a mantra of sorts: “No limits. Smash limits.” Aided by the instincts of his collaborators, Boyer threads together these wordy, detail-stuffed songs that are fast and staid, intense and gentle, paranoid and curious. Punk can be uniform and boring. By spreading out and proving adept at several modes, Tyvek show that this music can be plenty inclusive—that there are no limits.\"],[22392,\"While their recorded output was inversely proportional, the earthly fates for father and son Tim and Jeff Buckley were eerily similar. Whereas Tim released nine studio albums in his lifetime before a heroin overdose at the age of 28, his son Jeff released but one studio LP before drowning in the Mississippi River at the age of 30. And after their too young deaths, their posthumous fates have also been parallel, with a plethora of live recordings and outtakes swelling both Buckleys’ legacies. Since he had less material to draw upon, Jeff's discography and cult have sadly become the definition of barrel-scraping: a 2CD set of demos, a deluxe edition of Grace, three live albums, a live DVD, another album of soundboard tapes and demos, not to mention this year’s cash-in of covers. Jeff’s aura is lit by his unfulfilled potential, while Tim’s is shaped by the cautionary arc of an artist: from young fledgling to fully-realized artist to a man broken by the end of his life.Father Tim’s legacy continues to fly under-the-radar, in part because he recorded and released records at a clip, toured constantly, and never amassed a big fanbase. From his baroque-pop self-titled debut in 1966 through his astonishing avant-garde primal scream Starsailor in 1970 to the B&D r&b of Greetings From L.A., Buckley evolved and molted so quickly that even the most dedicated fan wouldn’t have been able to keep up. Even though a release like Lady, Give Me Your Key unearths never-before-heard material, it still doesn’t reveal anything new about the mercurial man.Part of what makes Key a lukewarm listen is its relation to one of Buckley’s heavy-handed early albums, 1967’s Goodbye and Hello, right before he matured with his expert fusion of folk and improvised jazz on 1969’s spellbinding Happy Sad. While the excellent 1999 set Works in Progress found him making leaps and bounds towards his breakthrough with every take, Key finds him still on the other side of that discovery, near the cul-de-sac of an exclusively “folk” artist. Bob Dylan was pushing at every boundary of the genre with each new album, but Buckley’s own breakthrough was still a year off.The unreleased title track is a sly play on the dual meanings of “key,” though it might be a red flag to begin a romantic relationship with anyone stashing a kilo of a controlled substance in their home. The demos of “Knight-Errant” and “Carnival Song” will land on modern ears like Ren Faire throwbacks, the heavy crackle of the acetate making them more of historical interest than listening pleasure. “Sixface,” another one of five unreleased songs included here, features the kind of lyrics that drastically age this particular era of Buckley’s songs with gobbledygook lines like, “Your seven seas and contraband on bluebird sun.” That said, you can hear how he trashed the rest of that quickly-strummed song, kept the opening plea of “Come here woman,” and later recast it as the central howl on Starsailor’s kinked and manic opening assault just a few years on.Some of Goodbye and Hello’s better moments are presented here in stripped-down acoustic versions, peeling away some of their studio trappings. “Once I Was” gets pared back and slowed to a crawl, the lonesome prairie harmonica line that hounded the released version nowhere to be found. The powerful “Pleasant Street” retains its power even in this crackly version, before Buckley decided to soar into a higher key at the chorus. The driving congas are missing on “I Never Asked to Be Your Mountain,” leaving just Buckley’s furious 12-string guitar and voice. It’s a striking early song, even if it reads now as a haphazard defense of being a deadbeat dad to his son: “The Flying Pisces sails for time\\/And tells me of my child\\/Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache\\/He begs for just a smile\\/O he never asked to be her mountain.”When there was a concert paying tribute to his father in 1991, “Mountain” was the song that Jeff Buckley decided to tackle and make his own. For a man who was all but abandoned by his father during his lifetime, there’s a latent rage and rightful sense of indignation when Jeff recasts his father’s voice as his own. It’s a bittersweet irony that in taking on his father’s song, it became his own coming out party, establishing Jeff as an iconic new voice and setting him on a path that would tragically echo that of his father. But while Jeff didn’t live long enough to scale those same heights, just beyond the scope of Key, we can hear just how high Tim climbed. \"],[22347,\"Mary Halvorson has been hailed for her technique ever since the debut of her trio. Recorded with bassist John Hébert and Xiu Xiu drummer Ches Smith, the guitarist’s first album as a bandleader referenced the power of noise-rock and the manic leaps of melody prized by her onetime teacher Anthony Braxton. Nearly a decade after that big splash, Halvorson still shreds with distinction, and that’s just one widely admired aspect of her art.With each subsequent recording on the Firehouse 12 label, she has kept a recognizable language intact while refusing to repeat herself. First, she turned her core trio into a quintet, adding alto sax and trumpet. Then she built the band into a septet, incorporating trombone and tenor sax. As her lineups have increased in size, Halvorson’s sophistication as a composer has come into focus. After a solo-guitar covers project in 2015, she’s back to enlarging her compositional palette—this time with an octet that adds pedal steel guitarist Susan Alcorn to the roster.This isn’t one of the instruments you’d typically expect to hear in a jazz group of any size, but its expressive range makes it a perfect fit for Halvorson’s quick-change compositional style. Alcorn’s pedal steel can suggest the warmth of country-western aesthetics, and also the droning sustain of ambient moods, often within the same tune. Opening track “Spirit Splitter (no. 54)” opens with a swaying line for the pedal steel on the surface. But underneath, the song teems with melodic activity. Ingrid Laubrock’s tenor saxophone navigates a tricky, ascending phrase, while other brass and reed players hit strutting, staccato passages. Amid the manic quality of the writing, there is still a relaxed vibe thanks to the players’ collective subtlety. The well-blended sound of this group can also be heard during the song’s spotlight features, as when trombonist Jacob Garchick improvises behind alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon’s incendiary solo.On Away With You, performances veer from tightly scripted to more free-sounding sections, before heading back toward established themes. But these transitions rarely feel jagged. The title track begins with arpeggios from Halvorson’s guitar that gradually fade into the background once harmony lines for the other instruments take over. After a development section, Alcorn’s guitar emerges, referencing Halvorson’s original part. Then the two guitarists break the theme down again, collaborating on some intense, minimalist riffing. Though Halvorson’s flintier attack is usually distinguished from Alcorn’s more rounded tone, here that’s not always the case. On “The Absolute Almost (no. 52),” Halvorson picks up a slide, occasionally emulating the sound of her pedal steel counterpart. Elsewhere, Alcorn uses an extended solo on “Fog Bank (no. 56)” to evoke experimental strumming effects that will sound familiar to Halvorson’s fans. The composer-bandleader doesn’t take as many solos this time around—she prefers to linger inside the sound of her octet. But when Halvorson does cut loose, as on “Safety Orange (no. 59),” she’s as inventive as ever.Trumpeter Jonathon Finlayson sneaks up on the listener, moving from a mellow to a regal sound in the course of a few bars. And Ches Smith’s drumming is similarly adaptable—offering straight-ahead swing rhythms as well avant-garde marches and clattering explosions. There aren’t many fast tempos to be found on Away With You, though the album still has a live-wire feel, thanks to the density of the writing and the crispness of all those performances. The result is one of Halvorson’s most entrancing sets yet—and the first one in which ensemble interplay seems even more important than the various soloists’ individual fireworks.\"],[22571,\"Having watched the shelf life for buzz bands grow ever shorter during the late ’00s, Sleigh Bells seemed to understand the need to make the most of their moment. In the wake of their breakthrough debut Treats they worked fast, firing off a couple more LPs within a year of each other, as if trying to refuse the world the chance to forget about them. Though it suffered the inevitable diminishing returns expected from a band that got everything right the first time around, 2012’s Reign of Terror nearly matched the blunt force of their debut, while distinguishing itself just enough with its arena-rock lean. But by their third effort 2013’s Bitter Rivals, the sugar rush had become a headache. The album was genuinely obnoxious in a way its predecessors had only pretended to be, and almost as troubling for a band whose power stemmed from their laser focus—their resolve to drive a single idea, brick on the gas pedal, head first through any obstacle in its path—it was strangely noncommittal.   For their fourth album, Sleigh Bells did something inherently risky for a band so of-the-moment: They took their time, piecing together Jessica Rabbit in stops and starts over three years, and it sounds like it. Recorded in part with Mike Elizondo, the seasoned Los Angeles producer best known for glossing up records for Eminem and his Shady\\/Aftermath cohorts, it’s a hodgepodge of clashing sounds and concepts that’s united only by its indiscriminate maximalism. Anybody holding out hope for another great, singular inspiration to strike the band again the way it did on their distortion-addled debut probably won’t find it even worth a cursory stream. What the album lacks in vision, though, it attempts to compensate for through sheer exertion. If nothing else, the duo has never seemed to be trying harder than they are here, so although Jessica Rabbit is even more scattershot than Bitter Rivals was, it at least has a sense of showmanship that album didn’t.  The album also smartly runs with the one thing that Bitter Rivals did right: giving more control to singer Alexis Krauss. Krauss had always been the face of Sleigh Bells, their head cheerleader and fun ambassador. Her past as a member of a teen-pop band was central to the group’s mythos, their link to the very music they were subverting. But as integral as she was to the band’s image, Treats didn’t give her all that much to do. Derek Miller’s compressed guitars were so loud, so blown out, that often all Krauss could do was play against them, injecting her airy voice here and there, and even then mostly to make the guitars feel that much heavier in comparison.   On subsequent efforts, Krauss has dialed up the ferocity to the point where she’s no longer juxtaposed against the fray—she is the fray. And as she takes on increased songwriting responsibilities on Jessica Rabbit, she’s also seized the chance to show off her full vocal range. On “Rule Number One,” her voice climbs from a Kesha sneer to a robust Xtina wail as she belts “POP ROCKS AND COKE MAKE YOUR HEAD EXPLODE!” over Miller’s hair-metal riffage. Somehow, she’s even louder than the guitars.  While Krauss relishes the opportunity to play the pop star she never got an actual chance to be, Miller succumbs to a reduced role. His spliced guitars propel “Crucible,” an admirably spirited mashup of circa-’87 Whitney Houston and Licensed to Ill-era Beastie Boys, but it’s hard to even guess what hand he might have had on the Elizondo co-production “I Can Only Stare,” a guitar-free, high-drama pop number closer to something you’d find on a Leona Lewis record than anything on Treats. Similarly, the brooding, EDM-tinged “Unlimited Dark Paths,” as with far too many Elizondo productions, sounds like it was somehow conceived with Skylar Grey in mind.   Even when Jessica Rabbit treads into generic territory, Krauss manages to leave a personal stamp on the material. “I was dreaming of a dead end street that we used to run down,” she sings on “Lightning Turns Sawdust Gold,” over a slinky, lighter-waving groove more than a little inspired by Santigold’s “Disparate Youth.” Elsewhere she calls out a partner who wastes a Friday night getting high and watching The Lion King, the kind of specific, seemingly autobiographic detail that rarely made its way into the first couple Sleigh Bells records. She takes ownership of these songs in a way she never did before.  So Jessica Rabbit is Krauss’s show, and she’s a show worth watching. The problem is it’s just not very catchy. On their first two albums, Sleigh Bells always had a granite hook to balance out the volume. But too many of these songs are just bluster in search of a purpose. Casualties of the duo’s noncommittal approach, they fall into a thankless gray area, too tinkered-over to function as punk, yet too haphazard to be great pop.\"],[22586,\"Eventually every rapper hits the point where they stop keeping up with the trends, either because they’ve lost interest in them or they’ve been left behind by them. It’s hard to tell which is the case for Jeezy. Perhaps he felt burned by the commercial failure of last year’s hitless Church in These Streets, a kinda-sorta attempt to engage with the modernist sounds of new Atlanta, or perhaps his heart was never in it, but on Trap or Die 3 Jeezy stops pretending to give even the slightest damn what listeners under 25 might be into. An album in title but mixtape in spirit, it’s a back-to-basics statement from a rapper who, even at his most commercial, never really strayed all that far from the basics to begin with.  “Let’s take these bitches back to ’05,” Jeezy rapped on “Way Too Gone,” from 2011’s TM 103: Hustlerz Ambition. That was three albums and five years ago, so it’s not like he’s ever been one to put the past behind him. It used to be that all that distinguished a Jeezy album from a mixtape was the potential that from time to time you might hear his authoritative groan over something other than the same default synth presets and trap snares, but with a tracklist dominated by Jeezy’s old-guard producers Shawty Redd and D. Rich, Trap or Die 3 promises from the outset that won’t happen. Amid the barrage of battle-cry adlibs and synthesized clatter, opener “In the Air” ends with a rant about “this watered-down shit I keep hearing on radio,” affirming the old truism that rappers only complain about the radio when they aren’t on it.  So Trap or Die 3 casts Jeezy as a true defender of trap, a music style that isn’t remotely endangered, in his own way every bit as evangelical about the craft as Jurassic 5 used to be about conscious hip-hop. A less charitable read is that he’s just trying to take an easy W after a couple of under-performing projects. That’s not the worst strategy at this stage in Jeezy’s career—by playing it so safe, the project often can’t help but hit its mark. “So What” moves with the ruthless efficiency of a slasher movie score, and “Goldmine” is similarly pared down to just the essentials: taut pianos, a few stray string stabs, and a ruthless snap of a beat. Jeezy seems reinvigorated by the familiar terrain. “Run a Fortune 500 from a pre-paid,” he boasts on the trim Yo Gotti feature “Where It at.” “Like That” nonchalantly lands the album’s most random punchline: “Have a threesome with the money: just me, you and Oprah.” And on the kinetic “Let Em Know,” the old T. Rex moves with velociraptor dexterity, matching a twitchy club tempo with a springy, hooky flow. There’s always a thrill in hearing that colossal voice move with that kind of speed; it's like witnessing somebody dunk an anvil.  Trap or Die 3 offers real reminders of Jeezy’s greatness, then, something Church in These Streets couldn’t claim. But some of these songs just sound terrible. “It Is What It Is” suffocates under a trash heap of gaudy, circa-2006 modulated horn noises, and its drum machines hit with all the tact of firecrackers going off in a tin can. “Recipe” continues Jeezy’s trend of inheriting the dullest beats Mike WiLL Made-It will sign his name to. And though courtship has never been Jeezy’s most fruitful muse, “Sexé” finds him putting even less effort into his come-ons than usual (“Bitch you know you sexy with your sexy ass…girl you know you flexing with your flexing ass.”) That track also features the record’s most flabbergasting inclusion, a partially inaudible verse from Plies that, to judge from its helpless mastering, he apparently recorded into an iPhone 4 from a bathroom stall.   How does something like that even make it onto a major-label album? Def Jam couldn’t have shelled out a few bucks to have a Plies verse re-recorded? It’s clear that in the streaming age labels have begun rubber-stamping releases that they previously would have intervened with, figuring there’s little to lose if the budget’s low enough. That’s good news for rappers who used to struggle just to get an album released. But for all the flak that label A&R teams get, at their best they incentivize innovation, pushing rappers to become something greater than themselves and providing them the resources to make it happen. Jeezy is nearing 40, and the window to promote him not just as a trap star but an actual star is closing. Nobody’s giving him that push anymore.\"],[22587,\"Shirley Collins is so deeply woven into the folk tradition, her own life story could be the dramatic tale of a forgotten threnody. Lodestar is Collins’ first album in 38 years, her first since she regained her ability to sing. Back in the late ’70s, following her divorce with her husband Ashley Hutchings, leader of the Albion Country Band, Collins lost her voice and retired from music. The doctors diagnosed her with dysphonia, but you might put it more fancifully; heartbreak robbed of her powers, just as some capricious faerie might steal away a child.A working-class woman from rural Sussex, Collins learned traditional English songs passed down from her grandmother and aunt and soon fell in with the early folk revival. After meeting the song collector Alan Lomax at a party, she traveled with him across America, collecting music from foundational figures such as Bessie Jones and Mississippi Fred McDowell. The journey was serialized in her book America Across The Water, and some of the recordings found their way into the Coen Brothers’ seismic O Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack. Today her admirers are legion: from Will Oldham to Billy Bragg to Current 93’s David Tibet, who was instrumental to coaxing Collins back to the stage in 2014. But as the comedian Stewart Lee—another long-time fan—writes in the liner notes, Collins’ music is “egoless,” her voice a conduit for these ancient and timeless songs. Never has this been so obvious as it is on Lodestar.At 81, Collins’ voice has grit and grain, both old and strangely ageless. There is the sense that she has stood still, and folk has revolved around her. Recorded in Collins’ front room in her cottage in Lewes in rural Sussex, Lodestar is comprised of interpretations of English, American, and Cajun songs dating from the 16th Century to the 1950s. She is surrounded by a small coterie of collaborators, chief among them musical director\\/producer Ian Kearey of Oysterband and Ossian Brown and Stephen Thrower, members of Cyclobe and both formerly of the English post-industrial group Coil. Speaking of Lodestar, Kearey resists easy comparison to Johnny Cash’s latter-day recordings with Rick Rubin, but there are clear parallels. Essentially the trio’s role here is to curate an atmosphere that gestures back to Collins’ storied past, while authentically capturing her in the here and now.There are fiddles, mandolins, and picked guitars, with Brown adding a droning hurdy-gurdy here, and a church pipe organ there. On several songs, there is something Collins simply refers to as “The Instrument”—a unique hybrid of a mountain dulcimer and a five-string banjo, which she commissioned back in the ’60s and played on 1968’s The Power of the True Love Knot. An opening 11-minute piece titled “Awake Awake—The Split Ash Tree—May Carol—Southover” weaves a rich web, tying together apocalyptic balladry, wailing hurdy-gurdy, Pagan carols, and the jingling bells of a Morris dancer. As Lodestar opens up, the theme of death takes hold—although life in these songs is cheap, and people perish in matter-of-fact ways. “Cruel Lincoln” is the tale of a mason conned by a landowner, who returns to seek revenge. In the background, you can hear the birds sing in Collins’ garden, even as the tale of butchery unfolds: “There was blood in the kitchen, there was blood in the hall\\/There was blood in the parlor where the lady did fall.” On “Death And The Lady,” which Collins first recorded with her sister Dolly in 1970, a wandering woman comes face to face with the Grim Reaper; but the quaver in Collins’ voice lends this version a faltering quality, only intensifying its sense of somber fatalism.If her voice is smaller now than back in the day, Collins is still capable of surprising range. A take on the old Cajun lament “Sur Le Borde De L’eau,” popularized by the Louisiana guitarist Blind Uncle Gaspard, is truly haunting. But a spry mischief runs through the nonsense song “Old Johnny Buckle,” in which the Johnny is given medical advice to rub his wife’s injured leg with gin, but drinks it instead, and is consequently sent to hell. This seam of black humor persists into “The Rich Irish Lady,” a song about a wealthy woman who spurns a doctor’s romantic advances, then falls ill and throws herself at his mercy. Not only does the doctor deny her, he announces that he will dance on her grave, and as the track segues into a manic Kentucky fiddle piece titled “Jeff Sturgeon,” you can imagine Collins kicking up her heels in her front room, cackling her head off.Many of the recordings Collins made in her song-collecting days were of aged singers, transmitting the tales and melodies they themselves learned in their youth. Back then, she was their custodian, but after a lifetime carrying them, she sounds at one with them; they have grown around her, and she has grown around them. That Lodestar exists at all feels like a minor miracle. That it is so exquisitely done is a small blessing on top.\"],[22550,\"For an artist whose bio reads that she was “born in 1784 in the backseat of a sea-foam green space pinto,” LA-based soul singer Kadjha Bonet’s debut LP The Visitor sounds a bit closer to home than that. Her sound is retro-fitted, but you only have to travel to, say, the experimental jazz-meets-soul-meets-singer-songwriter traditions of 1974 to find her home planet. Her voice twists Roberta Flack’s velvet tone around the archness of Shirley Bassey over creamery-rich strings, producing a sound as familiar as it is haunting. “Honeycomb,” is the album’s lead single, and alongside mid-album tracks “Nobody Other” and “Portrait of Tracy” it sets forth the best case for Bonet. Both are couched in a majestic sort of of blaxploitation soul, a mix of half-remembered Bond themes the string section from Curtis Mayfield’s 1972 epic Superfly. Bonet's voice is the twist in the fabric, the element that sends the song down a Lewis Carroll rabbit hole; her falsetto on “Nobody Other” creates a vortex where the Isley Brothers’ and Aaliyah’s version of “At Your Best” meet. It also features a rolling Hammond organ, another classic crate-dust sound.  Bonet employs the intentional oxymoron “fickle majesty” in “Honeycomb’”s lyrics, and the phrase is also an apt description for the album. The Visitor is an amazing virtuoso performance, both for Bonet’s voice and for the many instruments she plays on it. However, the songwriting loops and twirls around styles and concepts that traditionally have straight-line meanings, and it creates a bit of ear fatigue, especially when so much of the album sits in a luxurious mid-tempo. On “Fairweather Friend,” Bonet discovers the limits of a friend’s loyalty and mourns it with a cool, laconic vocal that drains all the sorrow of the song. The trilling harplike ripples behind her are lovely, but the song is a little inert.Bonet can’t be faulted for ambition; the plush arrangements bring to mind Janelle Monáe’s The ArchAndroid in their scope and scale. “Francisco” swirls together late-’60s Beatles psychedelia and “Walk On By” woodwinds into something that might be called “Sgt. Pepper soul.” On the title track she delivers the impressionistic lines “Skin the color copper\\/She comes without a call” in an overwhelmed rush. Immediately thereafter, “The Visitor” spills into a well-composed orchestral mini-suite and closes with a vocal run that displays the stunning full breadth of her voice. But The Visitor doesn't quite equal the sum total of its impressive pieces. Like a lot of talented artists working underneath their potential, Bonet offers a collection of familiar references, immaculately recreated, without telling us something about herself that we might hold onto. She is a master at her craft, but she hasn’t quite figured out what she wants to say just yet.\"],[22464,\"In a few short years, New Zealander Connan Mockasin has proven himself game for all manner of chameleonic collaboration. With just a few days in Marfa, Texas, he cooked up a little something with Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes, wrote for and served as Charlotte Gainsbourg’s backing band, and apparently played around with Vince Staples and James Blake on a not-released project. But most tantalizing was a long alluded-to collaboration with Sam Dust, formerly of the British dance-punk Late of the Pier. For all of the rapidity of those other connections, Mockasin and Dust first began smushing together their weird Play-Doh pop songs back in 2009. Meaning that well before Mockasin proclaimed Forever Dolphin Love and busted out a FreekiLeaks slow jam and Dust’s band imploded, Soft Hair was slowly growing.Hinted at seven years ago and many mixing delays later, Soft Hair finally appears. And for those tantalized\\/ perplexed at the thought at Mockasin’s creepy castrato set against the heavier, tweaked beats that Dust made as LA Priest will instead find him hewing much closer to the former’s sound. The soggy pretzel logic of Pod-era Ween informs songs like opener “Relaxed Lizard,” most pointedly with that band’s obsession with early Prince. It’s a good fit for Mockasin’s squeaky voice—which can twirl up to “Camille”-like heights without having to speed up the tape—but also for Dust, who can dip into Prince’s vibrato with conviction. “Lizard” almost passes as a helium-voiced sexy little number, until the come-on of “I’d love to fuck you” has to share space with the admission “when you find she’s seventeen” deflates the balloon completely.The waterlogged skank of “Jealous Lies” is a drunken ditty that replicates the kind of lo-fi weirdness that everyone from Paul McCartney to Aphex Twin has doodled in their home studios. The slow rise and fall of distant ocean waves and flanged-out guitar lines keeps “Lying Has to Stop” from being any kind of conventional beach track. It’s slow bubble could be seductive, except for Connan’s discomfiting come-on “I like to watch you run\\/But I’ll never touch your bum.” Dust’s dramatic over-emoting on “In Love” sticks out, but it’s the croaked chorus of “in love with the Japanese girls\\/in love with the Chinese girls” that turns the song irredeemably creepy.Every so often, the album strikes that tricky balance between queasy and cute. “Goood Sign” is strange and charming in equal measure, Arthur Russell mumblecore on downers, set atop a slo-mo ’80s Italo horror synth soundtrack. The drum machine may be set to ‘somnambulant’ on “Alive Without Medicine,” but it makes for a lazy groove that syncs well with Super Mario water world bloops. Dust finds a rubber boot beat midway through, only to have Mockasin’s voice break the spell and have the track resolutely meander off course. “l.i.v.” is a mild, languid closer, but it’s not hard to think that after seven years spent cooking, Soft Hair’s results come out half-baked.\"],[22570,\"The idea of a Jim James solo career was slightly perplexing at first. My Morning Jacket is a band in a true, old-school sense—now with a fixed lineup, any character in which would be hard to replace—but Jim James is the sole songwriter, and it has always been his vision driving them. What, exactly, was he leaving out? Yet as 2013’s Regions of Light and Sound of God suggested and his new record Eternally Even confirms, there are other ways to wield his hardly-of-this-earth voice, other ways to meld genres within his idiosyncratic hybrid of American music—music that wouldn't quite fit in the MMJ framework, but which needs to exist nonetheless.Eternally Even, logically enough, is more of a companion to James’ last solo LP than it is to My Morning Jacket’s stunning 2015 release The Waterfall, particularly in its deeper indulgence of James’ soul influences. But it takes those soul elements and submerges them in psychedelic textures, making for a head trip of an album. Regions was a strong record in its own right but felt less like a statement than a collection of songs—which, with material dating over the course of a few years, it sort of was. But Eternally Even sounds as if it was sequenced as one piece that requires front-to-back listening. James goes all-in on a frayed, psychedelic-soul aesthetic—“True Nature” sounds like an old funk song dropped in an aquarium. Many of the songs are built off of small instrumental passages that weave the album together: The simmering, festering bed of synths, bass and guitar in opener “Hide in Plain Sight” recurs in “We Ain’t Getting Younger Pt. 1,” which in turn pairs with its Pt. 2 to create the monumental core of the record. Eternally Even has also been touted as his most directly political writing of his career—pointedly released just before Election Day. This is another thing that, at first glance, could go almost awry—a topical Jim James record almost sounds like an oxymoron. James is not a literal writer, or at least not at his best when he’s being literal. His lyrics don’t work that way; his voice very much does not work that way. James can be most evocative when you have no clue what the hell he’s talking about. Who knows the meaning behind “Steam Engine,” yet it’s one of the most powerful songs he's ever written; this is the guy who wrote a song literally called “Wordless Chorus” and has penned numerous catharses built on “oh-ah” refrains and guitar freak-outs rather than narrative journeys. But he winds up succeeding, thanks to the haunting quality hanging over much of Eternally Even, reflecting the tensions of 2016. In fact, James only occasionally dips into concrete imagery you could associate with America’s political climate, with other songs only making oblique references. Sure, it’s clear where “Same Old Lie” is coming from, with lines like “If you don’t vote it’s on you not me” and “Is there any peace to be found in a lifetime?” Otherwise, it's one meditative note among many: There’s the rumination on mortality in “We Ain’t Getting Any Younger,”and then the more personal reckoning in “Eternally Even.” The album’s impact is rooted in how, collectively, humanity searches for hope for the future. As the album draws to a close, that seems to be where James wants to lead us. After all the twists and ruptures across the album, we get the floating hymn of “Eternally Even”—a song with James in near-reverie, letting his voice glide over an instrumental that sounds like clouds parting. That’s where the James we always knew comes through: offering his trademark transcendence, that voice cutting through the haze and murk of the album, of this year. And it acts as a salve when we most need it.\"],[22599,\"A$AP Mob’s proper debut album begins with a two-and-a-half-minute skit that takes place in a New York bodega. Pushing lead single “Yamborghini High” over seven minutes, it’s the kind of move that could easily be frustrating. Instead, it’s pretty funny: It’s a group of men trying to out-cozy each other, arguing about who has the most comfortable outfit. A$AP Rocky arrives with tall tales of a ridiculous getup that he boasts was inspired by global warming. It feels natural, which is a welcomed evolution for Rocky, aka That Pretty Motherfucker, who has for the longest time been far more concerned with designer credibility than wearability. The skit is a signal for what’s to come—an infectious sense of camaraderie and a marked return to A$AP’s core sound and strengths.In practice, Cozy Tapes is an A$AP Rocky album, as he appears on all but three songs. (For comparison, Ferg is on only two tracks, and Ant is at second-most with just four features.) Whether intentionally or not, the rest of the Mob readily acknowledge that it’s Rocky’s show. In one skit, they’re convinced to go somewhere only after verifying Rocky won’t join them. In another (there are a lot of skits here), someone’s pursuing a woman, and his greatest attribute is his association with Rocky and the perks that come with it. Taking the record for what it is, Cozy Tapes is Rocky’s most cohesive project since his debut.Beyond being the face of the group, Rocky proves that he remains, by far, the most talented rapper in the Mob—including Ferg. Each track on Cozy Tapes finds him successfully using a new flow: “Crazy Brazy” is an impressive display of agility; “Money Man” is all measured and melodic repetition; and “London Town” is his best, with bars that spill over and build on themselves. It’s the first time since LIVE.LOVE.A$AP where Rocky’s pure rapping ability is the focal point. He’s long been lauded as an expert stylist and curator, but that too often has been a distraction from his skill. Though the highs of LONG.LIVE.A$AP are very high (“Goldie,” “Long Live A$AP,” “1Train”), the entire album is bogged down by an obsession with high-profile collaborators and manufactured swagger, like an oversized Rick Owens outfit. Rocky, for his part, never rapped about much more than material goods, but that aspiration felt important when he was doing so over beats that he could command and felt specific to him—not overpriced ones that would go to the highest bidder. Cozy Tapes has a very modest roster of producers, which allows him to set the tone and vibe. None of these songs would stand out on their own (à la “Wild for the Night”) if not for Rocky and the Mob’s efforts on top of them.No matter how much Rocky excels, Cozy Tapes is still billed as an A$AP Mob album. As such, it is eons beyond Lord$ Never Worry, their debut mixtape, which is nothing more than a bloated victory lap that feels laughable four years later. On Lord$, there was a concerted effort to showcase the lesser known members of the collective, hoping to turn them from secret weapons into superstars. The tape succeeded in shining a light on Ferg, but no one else has popped off as intended.  Instead of trying to showcase individuals, Cozy Tapes has a great cohesion, with Ant, Nast, and Twelvyy playing bit roles. The exception is “Nasty’s World,” a track very much set up to be Nast’s “Method Man.” He’s a capable rapper, but that’s not enough, especially when younger rappers (like Lil Uzi Vert, Lil Yachty, and MadeinTYO—all showcased here) are succeeding and amassing followings with more experimental styles. Further, Nast sounds better on the subsequent track, “Money Man,” where he apes Rocky’s flow.Cozy Tapes’ emphasis on Rocky brings into question why it was ever turned into a group effort. Even the guests—most notably Tyler, the Creator, Wiz Khalifa, Skepta, and BJ the Chicago Kid—highlight Rocky, rather than upstage him. The most obvious answer is that the album is a tribute to the late Mob co-founder A$AP Yams, who would have wanted to see all of his friends excel. Yams was the architect of the A$AP sound, which has always been defined more by coolness than sonic markers: When Rocky made the big-budget shift from LIVE.LOVE to LONG.LIVE, a forward-thinking attitude remained consistent. Yams posthumously executive produced Rocky’s AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP, but that record felt more like what Yams would’ve wanted Rocky to make (that is, follow his heart) than what he, himself, would produce (a detritus-free swag rap album). Despite admirable verses, Cozy Tapes proves that A$AP Mob does not need to be Wu-Tang or Odd Future to succeed as a collective. It’s acceptable to have a star and a backup, with a few talented MCs to round things out and play straightman to the others’ flashy ways.Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends- is a very good hip-hop record even if it arrives at a time where the A$AP Mob are not at the center of the hip-hop zeitgeist. Rocky consistently entertains without delivering any one-liners, and the album is sequenced to mask some of the lesser members’ weaknesses. Cozy Tapes stays true to its name. The Mob grew immensely and then lost its spiritual guide, just as it needed someone to give them direction. In Yams’ memory, they turned inward looked at what they did best. It may not be the most ostentatious effort. But it is comfortable.\"],[22558,\"As a founder of indie rock institutions Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, and Folk Implosion, Lou Barlow’s career is synonymous with the scratchy production of an iconic lo-fi pioneer. When Barlow started releasing albums under his own name with 2005’s Emoh, he redefined himself as a more traditional singer-songwriter. And with last year’s Brace the Wave, he stepped even more decisively into “maturity” by crafting a solemn post-divorce album filled with complex adult emotions.Barlow’s hushed singing on Brace the Wave conveyed the panic inherent in facing a major midlife upheaval. But after such a personal album, his new five-song EP Apocalypse Fetish feels like a retreat from a late-career blossom. As its title suggests, the new EP tackles end-of-the-world angst, which might have made for a suitable counterpoint to Brace the Wave’s lyrical themes if Barlow hadn’t chosen to strip the new material down so that it emphasizes his voice and down-tuned ukulele.Barlow has been playing the ukulele since Dinosaur Jr.’s 1987 album You’re Living All Over Me—long before it became the instrument of choice for cute YouTube covers. But Barlow has never fallen prey to the preciousness that is often ascribed to the instrument. On Brace the Wave, for example, he used a baritone ukulele as a textured guitar, not a prop in a play. This time around, though, the ukulele booms in the middle of the mix, the toylike timbre of its strings offsetting the musical balance like a bull in a china shop.Of course, we’ve heard skeletal arrangements and jarring mix choices from Barlow plenty of times before. But strangely enough, Apocalypse Fetish stumbles into murky waters, as if Barlow couldn't decide between returning to his lo-fi days or sticking with his current, more discreetly elegant sound. Like Brace the Wave, Apocalypse Fetish is full of additional trimmings that Barlow and returning producer Justin Pizzoferrato tuck behind the backbone of the songs. On the title track, for example, a sudden appearance of acoustic guitar and keyboard in tandem splashes the song with drama and color. Barlow even double-tracks the ukulele at times and his bass remains more felt than heard. Still Pizzoferrato’s naked recording style that served Brace the Wave so well only highlights how incomplete these new arrangements are.As these songs show, Barlow isn't losing a step as a composer—his craft sounds more effortless as he grows. Unfortunately, Apocalypse Fetish is far too easy to mistake for a bunch of demos. On “Anniversary Song,” the absence of percussion actually strengthens the choogling rhythm of Barlow’s strumming, but it’s still framed as though he were performing it in a coffeehouse. Even if you think that works the first time around, Barlow scoops the percussion again two songs later on “Try 2 B,” a song that betrays the barroom rock‘n’roll stomper it truly is at heart.Likewise, the ends of some of his verses on “Pour Reward” glow with a tail of reverb, but the song never finds the middle ground between its dry immediacy and its atmospheric gestures. “Don’t trust anyone\\/When it's us who can't be trusted,” Barlow sings on the title track. “We’re perverse\\/The safer we are\\/The more unsafe we feel\\/That’s the curse.” Having fleshed out personal crisis so thoroughly the last time around, it's anyone's guess as to why Barlow holds back from doing so while tackling a major social crisis on this EP. But by this point, Barlow is well beyond having to force the raw amateurism that once defined him. He’s no amateur anymore, as even Apocalypse Fetish proves in spite of itself.\"],[22415,\"Brevity is among Mannequin Pussy’s strengths, but a controlled volatility is the Philadelphia quartet’s calling card. The mood of any given song can zap with a disconcerting swiftness from the playful to the chaotic. This dynamic persists on record and on stage. Opening for Colleen Green at Baltimore’s Metro Gallery last August, the band kicked up a series of shoegaze-y whorls, detonating their abrupt thrash-punk before the audience could let its guard down.Beginning in New York City, Mannequin Pussy was formed by childhood friends Marisa Dabice and Thanasi Paul, and their early demos set an ineffable foundation: indecipherable, sub-minute hardcore bursts, propelled by Paul’s sharp drumming and Dabice’s lashed punk chords. By 2014 debut LP Gypsy Pervert, the melodies buried in the group’s sound had clawed their way to the surface. Paul swapped out his drum kit for a guitar, and the band’s lineup reshuffled, while track lengths expanded modestly. Significantly, Dabice found her footing as a singer and songwriter, as evidenced by smart standouts like “Clue Juice” and “My Baby (Axe Nice),” where second-wave American punk and 1990s cuddlecore made uneasy common cause.For all of Pervert’s advances, it never quite gelled as an album. Romantic does. Its volcanic peaks and gauzy valleys hew to a sequential logic; neither a build nor a decline, but rather, the ferocious push-pull of a mosh pit. Dabice’s vocals have taken on a bitter insistency that suits themes best described as interpersonally political. Romantic also benefits from a consistent, road-tested lineup that includes bassist Colins Regisford and drummer Kaleen Reading. This tautness allows the band to double down on what it does best and roll a few dice.All lurch and glossolalia, “Pledge” suggests a lost My Bloody Valentine single harboring the paranoid stoicism of death metal. “Meatslave One” is a 56-second lamentation of smart-phone narcissism dressed in grunge flannel. The turbulent “Emotional High” and “Kiss” treat friend-dynamics from near and distant removes, respectively, with no punches pulled. On “Beside Yourself,” the don’t-look-back anthem that closes the album, the four mass their voices in angelic chorus to leaven what is a jagged, collective scorching of earth.A wild energy animates the 20-minute Romantic, as it spills out in every direction. This is most evident on “Ten” and “Denial,” when Dabice’s personality is especially harried and panicky, her lyrics Jenga-stacked and tripping over themselves, the songs supercharged. “Ten” rails against that kind of depression that can confine you to your bedroom, buckling so hard that the song risks shaking itself into pieces. “Denial,” a jangly, introspective self-inventory, explodes in wracked gasps. “Pick yourself up, baby, everything’s gonna be fine, but if not, so what?” she counsels, pleading. “You’ll get it right the next time\\/You should stop getting down on yourself, everyday.” These are words to live by.\"],[22600,\"Sid Vicious loved ABBA. Joe Strummer loved ABBA. Pete Townshend really loved ABBA. As a five year-old boy on a Welsh council estate in 1977, I loved ABBA. My mum and dad loved ABBA. If ever I went round to a friend’s house whose parents had a record player in the living room, you could count on there being an ABBA LP leaning in the Formica cabinet beside it. Everyone, so it seemed in my five year-old’s perspective of the universe, loved ABBA.  The four Swedes—two couples, Agnetha and Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid (aka “Frida”)—first invaded British shores in 1974 at the Eurovision Song Contest in Brighton with their winning entry, “Waterloo”; the United Kingdom awarded ABBA “nil points” on the night, making their subsequent domination of our charts one of the sweetest revenges outside the pages of The Count Of Monte Cristo. They properly conquered in 1976 with their Greatest Hits, the year’s biggest-selling album and the second biggest-selling album in Britain of the 1970s (beaten by Simon & Garfunkel’s Bridge Over Troubled Water which had the advantage of a six-year head start). The same year saw a triptych of UK number ones: “Money, Money, Money,” “Fernando,” and the unstoppable “Dancing Queen,” which sold over a million copies and spent six solid weeks at the top. That the latter’s parent album, Arrival released in October 1976, should consolidate their stronghold was a fait accompli. By 1977 ABBA were unshiftable, omnipresent and commercially invincible.  Arrival was their fourth studio album but the first to forge an identity in tandem with its introduction of their soon-to-be iconic trademark reversed B logo. Its three predecessors—1973’s Ring Ring, 1974’s Waterloo, and 1975’s ABBA—had been a series of costume-changing forays and false-starts through folk-rock, glam, light ballads, and novelty rock‘n’roll. Nobody yet regarded ABBA as an albums band until the million-selling phenomenon of 1976’s Greatest Hits propelled them to the forefront of the market. An intriguingly-misnamed 15 track compilation from an act who’d so far made the UK singles charts just five times, to British audiences Greatest Hits acted as ABBA’s equivalent to a debut album, its success highlighting a major transformative shift: from the bedroom turntable at 45 rpm to the family stereo at 33 1\\/3. ABBA could never have succeeded as a teen pop act alone. The coup of Greatest Hits owed much to its appeal to the same age group as seen on its cover: four adults sat on a park bench in contrastingly coupled yin and yang of romantic bliss and collapse.   If Greatest Hits certified ABBA as undisputed superstars, on Arrival, the first album to follow it six months later, they finally looked like superstars, the kind who travelled in private helicopters like the one on the cover in which they’re cocooned with curiously cool expressions. The distance between this image and the terrestrial park bench portrait of Greatest Hits can be measured in light years. They could be The Tomorrow People. They could be from Tatooine. They could be four superbeings itching to escape some spooky spherical Phantom Zone. They are unmistakably other.  At their best, as on Arrival, ABBA are as mysteriously out-there as Bowie, as rococo as Phil Spector, as unbearably sad as the Smiths. At the centre of their infinitely bright star is a throbbing black mass of pain. “The Winner Takes It All” from 1980’s Super Trouper is still the debate-settler that ABBA are pop’s greatest tragedians, hailing as they do from a land of inherently fatalistic art, from the films of Ingmar Bergman to the face of Greta Garbo. The pagan Swedes of old believed that the end of the world was a coming inevitability they called “ragnarok.” ABBA are the sweet echo of that same ancient stoic pessimism. Ragnarok‘n’roll.  The second track on Arrival and ABBA’s only US number one in April 1977, “Dancing Queen” is one of the greatest pop records ever made because, like so many of the greatest pop records ever made, it throws multiple reflections. Its surface beauty and emotional depth is wholly dependent on the ear of its beholder. For some, it’s an emancipatory cry of joy. For others, a bawl from an abyss of sorrow. The song’s first discernible human sound is a suspended, exhaled “Ooo-ooh!” It could be a dove-like coo, or it could be a suppressed sob. Perhaps this is the song of someone who wants to be Esmeralda but knows they are Quasimodo; the harrowing dream of life outside as imagined by somebody imprisoned indoors. The “dancing queen” could be an isolated young girl alone in her bedroom, too scared, too shy, almost certainly believing herself too hideous to step out into Friday night; her one happiness her unrealistic fantasy that she could find love amongst the beautiful people out on the dancefloor.  In this, its darkest reflection, the one directed by Bergman and starring Garbo, “Dancing Queen” is a song about the loneliest girl in the world, a “How Soon Is Now?” in “Rock Your Baby”’s clothing.   It’s safe to say that the ABBA writing team of Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus, and manager Stig Anderson were not trying to create a “How Soon Is Now?”; the abandoned first verse of its original 1975 demo began with the bubble-gum burst of “Baby, baby, you’re outta sight!” But they were trying to write a “Rock Your Baby.” The rhythm of “Dancing Queen” was directly inspired by George McCrae’s 1974 hit, even if theirs hasn’t quite the same slickness of syncopation. There’s a strange falter, as if the beat is stumbling under the weight of the flamboyant Liberace piano pounding overhead. “Dancing Queen” is almost disco, were it not for that rhythmic limp. It’s clubfooted disco, American R&B as could only be made by white Vikings who didn’t fully understand the instructions.  The power of their music lies in the enigmatic Mona Lisa smile created by similar accidents of mistranslation. As Andersson once stressed, “We are not Anglo-Saxon.” ABBA were four spectacularly talented Nordic persons trying to emulate Western Anglo-Saxon pop. Their ancestral blood was non-Christian, an ice-and-fire race who believed in giants, dwarves and elves, of ancient pagan sagas that inspired Wagner and Tolkien. The members of ABBA could learn and sing in English, but they still thought like Scandinavians. Their phrasings made grammatical sense but their assembly of words were not the natural choices of any lyricist for whom English was a first language.  It may also explain why the biggest-selling album in Britain of 1977 opens with a song about a schoolgirl aching to sleep with her geometry teacher. There is no ambiguity of meaning in the harmonic rush of “When I Kissed The Teacher.” “One of these days,” sings Agnetha, “gonna teach him a lesson alright.” The moral dilemma of this unexpurgated Lolita pop is only numbed by its sheer innocence of delivery. But then “love” in ABBA songs, legal or otherwise, rarely runs smooth. “My Love, My Life” and “Knowing Me, Knowing You” are two adjoining sides of the same heartbroken prism, the words of both virtually interchangeable. “I know I don’t possess you\\/So go away, God bless you” wails the first. “Breaking up is never easy I know\\/But I have to go,” sighs the second. In ABBA songs people are always going, never to but forever away.  None of the lyrical protagonists on Arrival are happy. “Carrie,” the heroine of the neurotic disco-ragtime “That’s Me,” is a self-deprecating mess. The woman in the daft “Dum Dum Diddle” is ill with sexual frustration, literal second fiddle to her maestro lover who’d sooner pluck his Stradivarius. The narrator of the Cabaret-inspired “Money, Money, Money” yearns for a rich Trump-style suitor, but “if he happens to be free, I bet he wouldn’t fancy me.” Men, too, get just as raw a deal on “Why Did It Have To Be Me?,” Björn’s barroom boogie about a sap who loses his heart, all but one lap-steel and two fingers of whisky short of vintage Hank Williams.    And then along comes Jack the Ripper. “I am behind you, I’ll always find you,” screech the banshee sisterhood of Agnetha and Frida on the predatory “Tiger,” a fabulously unsettling psycho-pop thriller of urban dystopia and Droogish violence not so very far away from Diamond Dogs: “The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream.” “Tiger” is an alarmist horror story of metropolitan evil as imagined by folk who did most of their songwriting in an idyllic country cottage on Stockholm’s island peninsula. It’s also one of the better demonstrations of the sonic voodoo that occurs in the vacuum between Agnetha’s and Frida’s voices, a skull-rattling counterpoint when their respective wavelengths collide to create a near-supernatural vibration.   This same nuclear fusion of blonde soprano and auburn mezzo-soprano is why all attempts to cover ABBA songs end in failure. They are literally inimitable. ABBA’s music lands on the ear in bold strokes, but it arrives there through the most meticulous construction. They are not European impressionists but Northern renaissance masters, building up the sound layer by layer, one coat at a time with fanatical precision. Hence the glow in the opening notes of “My Love, My Life,” an ethereal cosmic tone evoking the fellow Scandinavian-blooded Gustav Holst. Hence the Valkyrie choir of “Dancing Queen” detonating its apocalypse of goosebumps. And hence why Arrival’s closing title track feels like being serenaded to sleep by God.  “Arrival,” the song, is colossal. Less a song, since there are no words, than a glacier of sound, the eerie buzz of divine light as it harpoons through stormy clouds. “Arrival” was named after the title of the album had already been decided. As originally written it was called “Ode to Dalecarlia” in honour of the Swedish folk province where, as late as the 19th century, the local culture still communicated in medieval runes straight out of The Hobbit. Melodically, “Arrival” is therefore ABBA at their most inscrutably Nordic and, to Anglo-Saxon ears, at their most other. It is a hymn from beyond the stars.  Last month it was announced that ABBA are due to make a live “comeback” of sorts in 2018, though seemingly not in physical body but some form of virtual spirit. Described as “a time machine,” the project in partnership with American Idol mogul Simon Fuller will “enable a new generation of fans to see, hear, and feel ABBA in a way previously unimagined.” Touring holograms, perhaps? If so, it would be a fitting fate for the intangible enigma of ABBA. At once here and not here, teasing us in the void between. Forty years later, still waiting for them to arrive.      \"],[22566,\"Pras Michel first came to Wyclef Jean at his dad’s church in New Jersey looking to join a band, not a rap group. Wyclef was already something of a local celebrity in the mid ’80s, writing raps in a session produced by Kurtis Blow for a group called Exact Change (on a single recording that was never released), and picking up the nickname the Rap Translator. Pras sought out Clef to play trumpet in the church band. As Wyclef tells it, Pras was a dreadful trumpet player, but he introduced Wyclef to two young musicians from his Newark high school: the mononymously known “Marcy” and a choir singer named Lauryn Hill. Even then, Hill was preternaturally talented, with a deep-rooted knowledge of R&B and Motown soul. Pras was an instrumentalist who was privy to rap as a kid but blocked from listening to it, instead spending long afternoons scanning the dials of his family radio for hard and soft rock. And he sought out Wyclef, who was already adapting the music of the Caribbean to fit his own, to add more reggae flavor into the mix. When Marcy abandoned the group after a few sessions, the trio adopted the name Tranzlator Crew, then later, Fugees.The Fugees, as many have come to know them, appeared fully formed in 1996 on “Fu-Gee-La,” the lead single from the trio’s ground-breaking, major label opus, The Score. But “Fu-Gee-La” predated the polished, finished project, starting as a raw loosie produced on the fringes of a session for a “Vocab” remix. It was created in the early-mid ’90s when the group was still experimenting, on a beat Salaam Remi originally made for Fat Joe. In those moments, before The Score was even conceived, the Fugees were slowly coalescing into a unit. Under the direction of Kool & the Gang co-founder Khalis Bayyan (then Ronald Bell), they were working on their debut album called Blunted on Reality.Each member had a unique musical history, leading to a sonic information trade of sorts—capitalizing on Lauryn’s internal soul music archive, Pras’ hard- and soft-rock reference points, and Wyclef’s reggae reworks. The smorgasbord of sound registered as rap but only when stripping several layers of context away; the Fugees packed reggae-flecked, raucous romps and remixes into 18 tracks, and attempted to package it as traditionalist hip-hop. The result was a commercial flop, selling (literally) 12 copies, and sending the group back to the drawing board. For all its eclecticism, Blunted on Reality is still a relic of its era—heavily indebted to rap’s elite samplers and sound-bending maestros De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Main Source, and even Digable Planets—and it's a bit raw and rough around the edges, a mostly croon-free ragga rap opus that’s far less explicit with its social and political ideals than The Score but twice as enthusiastic. The album scans as a style sampler of early ’90s alt hip-hop. But with the benefit of hindsight, it’s a fun, low-stakes gambit straddling the margins of boom bap, jazz rap, and reggae fusion without pause, and it’s a transformative experience for its MCs.The trio have said in the past that they let producers wrestle away creative control of the record, creating a product they didn't recognize, and they carefully distanced themselves from it during the press junket for The Score. But Blunted on Reality is essential to the myth of the Fugees and to the sonics of their seminal album. Without this commercial misfire, there is no colossal comeback story, no extra push to silence naysayers who wrote the album off as a failure, and they couldn’t have made something as refined as The Score without making this record first. Despite its status as the underwhelming precursor to a classic, Blunted on Reality is a marvel of pure energy and noise that musters up rage and exuberance in equal measure. It’s clearly a response to racial injustice, xenophobia, and inner-city violence, but the album never wages war with any of these topics directly. Instead, there are one-off references to shootings, to the Klan and black oppression, and to intolerance, amid a party pack. Its zeal is sadly as timely as ever. “Hide nigga hide, flee nigga flee, run nigga run\\/For I’ve got my hood, my cross, my tree, my gun\\/My rope, and it’s a long one,” Lauryn recites in the intro. Seconds later, Wyclef puts it even more plainly: “You maintain to put a negro in pain.”Blunted on Reality sits squarely at the intersection of New York City and Croix-des-Bouquets, mixing big-city swagger with an outsider’s mentality (ideas best articulated by interludes “Harlem Chit Chat” and “Da Kid From Haiti”). The reggae influence lines the seams of songs like “Temple” and “Refugees on the Mic,” which forgo heavy boom-bap for more leisurely, island-friendly tempos. The accents disappear on the shout-rap tracks, but sneak out for the hooks on “Recharge” and “Boof Baf” and in the opening moments of “Giggles.” It’s a triumph of black American immigrants, constantly mixing cultural cues. The breakbeat on the roughneck rousing “How Hard Is It?” is almost New Jack Swing-like, while “Nappy Heads” makes an escapist anthem out of an Earth, Wind, and Fire ballad. Slowly but surely, the Fugees find their voices on Blunted on Reality, taking turns with bludgeoning verses that do most of their damage with sheer force. Lauryn often sounds MC Lyte-ish in her inflections, less assured and measured in her pronunciations than she would become on later albums, but she is still clearly the group’s X factor, with raps that burst at the seams and a standout solo cut (“Some Seek Stardom”). When the dust had settled, the trio had three hit singles and a platinum album to their name, and Blunted on Reality had been reduced to an asterisk in the Fugee story, Lauryn would later tell Ebony in November ’96 that “kids need to know there’s more to life than a five-block radius,” that the Fugees spoke for the disenfranchised. The Score delivered that in its messages, but before that, Blunted on Reality proved it with an uncompromising sound. \"],[22520,\"Sun Ra’s presence on the latest Merzbow record is odd: blink and you might miss him completely, but squint and you can notice him almost everywhere. The only time it’s blatantly obvious that Masami Akita, the man behind noise legend Merzbow, is using Sun Ra’s recordings as source material comes in the first 10 seconds of Strange City. Opener “Livid Sun Loop” begins with overlapping saxophones and drums, but Akita quickly steamrolls those into a dense cacophony. For the rest of the album’s 103 minutes (66 on CD and 36 on LP, both titled Strange City but containing different music), he steadfastly maintains that busy din.Yet focus your ears intensely on Strange City—preferably through headphones—and Sun Ra’s music peeks out through Merzbow’s noise wall. (The Ra estate gave Akita material from 1966’s The Magic City and 1967’s Strange Strings, which he remixed and treated while adding his own original sounds). Rattling drumbeats grow out of crackling static like weeds in a garden, bassy rhythms undulate beneath rolling roars like shifting tectonic plates, and pretty much every screech and squeal could pass for a wailing horn. Strange City is decisively a Merzbow record, but Sun Ra lives in its DNA.Where Strange City stands in Merzbow’s massive discography is easier to suss out. Many of the strengths Akita has developed over roughly four decades of noise devotion are put to use here. He creates relentlessly forward-moving music with so much going on that it feels three-dimensional. During such lengthy tracks, your ears and brain accept and acclimate to Akita’s ruthless sounds, and his seemingly random noise eventually starts to feel normal.Strange City is most successful on the two half-hour-plus tracks that make up the CD version. “Livid Sun Loop” is filled with destructive sounds and stabbing rhythms, but it also has a narrative arc developed through 32 minutes of sonic drilling. On “Granular Jazz Part 2,” Akita grapples most seriously with Sun Ra’s creative spirit. Devoted primarily to the trebly end of the spectrum, the piece subtly rides Ra’s rhythms while building a space-bound aura, a fitting way to grapple with an artist who claimed to come from Saturn.The three tracks on the LP version of Strange City—all titled as parts of “Granular Jazz”—are less distinctive. In some places, Akita falls back on stock noise moves like firing-laser jolts and helicopter-style whirr. Something interesting happens on every piece, though, and the closer “Granular Jazz Part 4” is particularly fascinating due to its relative restraint. Surprisingly distant and subdued, it’s like Merzbow’s ballad of Sun Ra, an elegy for a virtual partner coming after 100 minutes of sonic boxing. You could call Strange City a Merzbow victory, but it couldn’t have happened without Sun Ra on his team.\"],[22574,\"Over the last few years Chicago has been one of hip-hop’s most conspicuous artistic incubators. This year alone, the hip-hop and R&B artists Jamila Woods, Joey Purp, Saba, and Kweku Collins have enjoyed breakout attention as indie auteurs with respective solo projects. All of them have worked with Chance the Rapper and others in the same scene, and two are signed to the same label, Closed Sessions. Now, that label’s house producer, oddCouple, is getting his turn with a new record called Liberation, which gathers up a bunch of this familiar Chicago talent for a showcase compilation. Born in Milwaukee but long based in Chicago, Zach Henderson adopted oddCouple as a solo act several years ago after initially sharing the name as half a duo. Henderson played bass and cello earlier in his life, and he now folds live instruments into his beats, which are warm and muffled and frequently meander towards breakdowns instead of looping back on themselves. Liberation follows 2015’s Chatterbox, which oscillated between a soulful instrumental beat tape and a rappers' roll call. This new one is more fleshed-out and timely, and finds oddCouple doubling down on the recent success of his counterparts and elevating his own craft at once. There isn’t an outright misstep, but since many of the featured artists on Liberation have recently released their own singular statements, a few performances feel second-rate or less than vital. Still, nothing here screens like a called-in favor, and Henderson is a smart matchmaker. Joey Purp stands out on “Visions,” a twinkling chipmunk soul loop that gets the producer’s characteristic build-it-up-to-break-it-down treatment. Purp is a casual, confident rapper with the rare knack to boil things down to palatability while avoiding cliche. “It’s the places we live in that they refuse to go\\/So when we speak about struggles they can refuse to know,” he raps. The woozy and feverish “Love Above” is set compellingly against a chorus that is upbeat and whimsical. The song switches up several times, back and forth between Kweku Collins and Jamila Woods, but its Woods’ wonky chorus that sticks.Several songs on Liberation feature strings, but none feel as big as those near the end of the album. On “Hereditary” oddCouple rolls out the red carpet for GLC, a veteran Chicago rapper who quietly helped pave the way for the city’s current relentless indie bent. (“Why you ain’t signed?\\/Wasn’t my time,” he rapped triumphantly on Kanye West’s first album.) The emcee hasn’t lost a step or the slur in his voice, never a flashy rapper but always a commanding presence. The Cleveland artist and Closed Session signee Kipp Stone gets a deserved look here too, making the best of a thoughtful hook with his raspy baritone, shouting “Just listen at me\\\\\" and \\\\\"Hands up, don’t shoot!” before the elder statesman launches into a gorgeous pair of verses. Musically, the most interesting moments on the album come at the end of songs, when Henderson redirects and then turns away from the vocalist he’s holding up, usually stripping back elements from the beat. He has a nimble way with transitions within a song, and is never abrupt about switching gears into sparse, live-played trail-offs; these moments feel like carefully placed and immediately recognizable fingerprints. Some of that effect is missing on the lone instrumental, a sleepy track that swells towards the dance floor but never commits fully. Still, a solitary send-off is a smart maneuver on a wider scale as well, and Henderson has done more than enough to stamp out his identity as a producer throughout. \"],[22452,\"Ween famously broke up in 2012 after Aaron Freeman told Rolling Stone—but not his bandmate Mickey Melchiondo—that he needed time to convalesce after a drug-related breakdown. This marked the first time since 1984 that the two childhood friends would ostensibly retire their alter egos, Gene and Dean Ween, for their civilian names. While Freeman made it to the other side of that dark period with a baptismally purgative album, Melchiondo remained the same technically gifted clown in all his endeavors. Now, this consistent energy extends to his solo debut with the Dean Ween Group, the first invocation of his original band on an album since its dissolution and recent reinstatement. And in its ambitious genre hopping and sometimes-hilarious-sometimes-cringeworthy childishness, The Deaner Album is the closest thing to a proper Ween album in a decade.Much like Ween’s early output—think God Ween Satan: The Oneness through Chocolate and Cheese—The Deaner Album is a collagist pursuit that simultaneously honors and apes the various styles it probes. “Mercedes Benz” experiments with the funky lurch of Parliament-Funkadelic, while “Shwartze Pete” celebrates Les Paul with the legend’s nasally, vintage guitar noodling. Lead track “Dickie Betts,” an instrumental highlight, is an improvisational southern rock tribute to the former Allman Brothers Band guitarist, and maybe even a self-referential nod to the guitarist’s leap from second to first in command.Most noticeably, however, The Deaner Album intuitively echoes songs that have populated Ween’s variegated discography, something that seems inevitable given the band’s self-perpetuating mythology—their “brownness.” The arena-primed “Garry” sounds like if Chocolate And Cheese’s “A Tear for Eddie” was reconfigured as a Lynyrd Skynyrd ballad, while “Gum,” a truly grating listening experience during which Melchiondo lists kinds of gum, is a close cousin to “Candi” and borrows the disquieting triangle jabs of “Spinal Meningitis.” And of course, this wouldn’t be a Ween-peripheral record without a shit reference so “Doo Doo Chasers” checks that box and ends the record on a particularly brown note, much the way “Poop Ship Destroyer” concludes Pure Guava.Puerile antics are seemingly foundational to what made Ween so great, but really it was the band’s delicate balance of sincerity and irreverent surrealism. This had everything to do with the dynamic between Gene and Dean, the former a more philosophically minded, if outlandish, songwriter, the latter the brash, instrumental wonk. So even though Dean’s album features guest appearances from the Meat Puppets’ Curt Kirkwood, and punk drummer Chuck Treece, The Deaner Album lacks a fundamental humaneness and veers toward uncouth, guitar face-inducing force.This pays dividends for the bar-rock and instrumental tracks on this record, but a lot of the lyrics and imagery can be ham-fisted (“Charlie Brown” is a song about being unlucky, for example), and in one case, crudely misogynistic. “Tammy” is a seedy tale whose chorus details using the song’s namesake as a sexual object and then murdering her with a shotgun: “Tammy, bring me my Shammy\\/So I can clean my shotgun and bury you below.” Ween occasionally made forays into politically incorrect territory, but Deaner’s latest entry isn’t so much funny as it is straightforwardly unnerving.The comedic and lyrical height of this record, however, belongs to “Exercise Man,” which paints a plainspoken portrait of a “fucking douchebag exercise man,” who works out every day even though he will “die at 57 of a heart attack.” It is a really quick, blunt song about the futility of constructive behavior and boasts the description: “He uses the weight room at the Motel 6,” which should have been a punchline about Drake’s softness three years ago. It’s aware that it’s aggro and is brutally funny. And perhaps that is the small magic of The Deaner Album: it makes you feel like you are in on a longstanding inside joke with an old friend. Even if the joke is super dumb and at times problematic, it is strangely comforting to know that the guy responsible hasn’t changed one iota. \"],[22588,\"At 11 albums strong, Common’s career has passed through so many stages that he’s got a trail of shed skins, including two or three different rappers (and half a rockstar) along the way. So when his later-period albums, from 2014’s tough and sorrowful Nobody’s Smiling to this week’s striking Black America Again, are called a return to form for the Chicago-bred MC, it may be important to clarify which form he’s returning to, and establish some signposts for hearing an album as momentous as this one is. Back in 2014, Common’s frequent collaborator Questlove called for a revival of protest music in the wake of a grand jury’s decision not to indict the police officer who killed Eric Garner. Scarcely two years on, ugly racial rhetoric has characterized a seemingly endless campaign season, outrage over extrajudicial police killings has taken on a sort of sick rhythm, and it’s actually hard to remember a world where there was a shortage of protest music. D’Angelo’s Black Messiah, Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly and Solange’s A Seat At the Table, among others, have upended expectations and reinvigorated and expanded the category frames (hip-hop, soul or simply black music) placed around them.This is important context for listening to Black America Again, partly because great albums from the Okayplayer\\/Soulquarian family seem to come in waves—and there is a strong case to be made that Black America Again is to Black Messiah what Like Water for Chocolate was to the 2000-era classics Voodoo and Things Fall Apart.  Some of the big-room soul flourishes (courtesy of John Legend and BJ the Chicago Kid) trend toward the thematically safer sound that characterized Com’s Oscar winning Selma song; a touch expected—corny, even—if still emotionally stirring. But overall Karriem Riggins’ gritty, moody production provides Com with his most eclectic (and apt) sonic backing since Kanye's production on Be. It may also be the angriest—and not coincidentally, sharpest lyrically—we've seen Com since his Ice Cube dis “Bitch In Yoo”—warmed-over beefs with Drake notwithstanding.Yet there is clearly more to Black America Again than just ripped-from-the-headlines timeliness. After all, in a season when #BlackLivesMatter is at the front of the public consciousness, pretty much every artist who shows up to the BET Awards (and a bunch who didn’t) has adopted the appropriate signifiers of Woke-ness—right down to erstwhile Rubber Band Man T.I.—without necessarily touching artistic greatness. It is, in fact, the way the current mood dovetails with Common’s personal story arc that gives it its power. After prophetically calling on America to “Impeach [Bush] and elect Obama” on Jadakiss’ 2004 “Why” remix, Com has arguably spent the Obama years seeking a worthy opponent for his battle skills—and failing to locate one. The bloodshed and racial tension of 2015-16 have finally focused his considerable firepower. It also doesn’t hurt that it was helmed by the brilliant Karriem Riggins, the Detroit-based drummer who has been a staple of Common’s live band for years—and who has truly stepped into his own with his production work here.Riggins works firmly in the post-metric genre-verse first explored by J Dilla, but he is one of the few beatmakers who can truly hang with the master. His sonically grungy, emotionally and rhythmically complex arrangements push Com’s flow into an off-balance, never-quite-slipping dance that will be familiar to longtime fans as Com’s zone. From the moment he stepped on the scene in the early ’90s, Com has been a sharp battle rapper, noted for laying down bars in solid combinations of gut-punches like a prize fighter, yet capable of a sort of tipsy whimsy when he allows himself to be loose.This is exactly the side of Common that Riggins’ compositions bring out of him, and for the first 10 tracks or so, the album flows along flawlessly. Frenetic drum patterns rush ahead of the beat even as noodle-y electric jazz textures and screwed vocal samples pull backward at different speeds, interrogating the meter of  “straight” time in ways that recall Dilla’s drunken drums. Bilal’s vocals add another layer of virtuosic dissonance to several tracks while Common’s Yoda-like constructions (“As dirty as the water in Flint the system is”) create internal rhyme schemes and tripping-into-the-next bar rhyme schemes in counterpoint with the off-kilter beats.The chemistry is so right, in fact, it’s enough to make you re-evaluate Com’s career arc, at least since 2000. For many fans his artistic growth peaked in the Soulquarian era, then spun out on Electric Circus where he maybe got a bit too loose. In this reading of Common’s story arc, recent outings (2011’s The Dreamer\\/The Believer; 2014’s Nobody’s Smiling) are less comeback triumphs than back-to-basics bootcamps, or the solid road-game victories he needed before he regained the confidence to stretch out and loosen up a little again.The single and title track “Black America Again” is a brilliant case in point; huge piano chords overpower a drum break that is EQ’ed into such crispy upper reaches of the treble range that it threatens to disappear, an inversion of all conventional pop or hip-hop logic. Even Stevie Wonder’s relentlessly melodious voice is chopped and phrased in unexpected ways and Com’s delivery channels the spoken-word of his idols the Last Poets in a way that stands alongside his very best verses: “You know, you know we from a family of fighters\\/Fought in your wars and our wars\\/You put a n***a in Star Wars\\/Maybe you need two\\/And then maybe then we’ll believe you.”Momentum falters a bit on “The Day Women Took Over” a well-meaning narrative that posits woman-power as the solution to all problems but reduces them to embodiments of abstract virtues, rather than identities or agents of their own desires, reminiscent of Spike Lee’s Chi-Raq. But Common finds his footing again with “Little Chicago Boy” (the requisite variation on “Pop’s Rap”) and “Letter to the Free,” which serves as a sort of closing argument. If it ends the album on a more sedate note, the choice feels deliberate, reminding us that in his most inspiring moments, Common is swinging at the Big Questions of our time, and that even his loose improvisations are still part of a larger project. It’s very much worth unpacking that project, since it both dovetails with and cuts against the grain of modern Black activist thought. Common has in fact taken heat for suggesting in interviews that Black people should respond to racism by “extending my hand in love.” Even as he gives voice to his hurt and anger and eloquently runs down the undeniable crimes committed against Black Americans, he seems to be asking again throughout the album’s lyrics what freedom could even look like in this America—and time and again he suggests that freedom itself is an act of improvisation, of imagination, that begins now: “We write our own story.”It’s in the context of these bigger ideas that Com lands some of his biggest gut-punches of all time, while rapping in his simpler, prize fighter mode: “No consolation prize for the dehumanized\\/For America to rise\\/It’s a matter of Black lives\\/And we gon’ free them so we can free us…”—bringing home again the sheer magnitude of the forces he’s been dancing with all along.\"],[22455,\"The music of Sam Ray’s Ricky Eat Acid project has always elicited a kind of déjà vu. Whether it’s his journal-entry song titles or the way his music sounds like field recordings of a mental thunderstorm, the experimental producer\\/songwriter tricks you into thinking you are hearing extracted elements of your own past. Describing the inspiration of a mix he curated in 2014, Ray mentioned his fascination with a “paranoid, summer-y feeling that something familiar isn’t as familiar as it looks at first glance.” Though his sizable discography has often mined regret and retrospection, Talk to You Soon is the most severe account of an emotional haunting. It explores the idea of how personal upheaval perverts both memory and the comfort of nostalgia. There is a strange paradox about the way we remember things. As Israeli neuroscientist Yadin Dudai explained it on a 2007 episode of Radiolab: “If you have a memory, the more you use it, the more likely you are to change it. So, if you never use your memory, it is secured.” Such is the way that Ray explores this fixation of the past. On several songs, lyrics are cast as repeated chants that assume different meanings from their first utterance to their final. Where “Nice to See You” transforms from robotic to sincere with its eponymous phrase, “This Is as Close to Heaven as I Get” degrades from blissful to sinister over the course of a dozen repetitions of the song’s titular statement. The beautiful, far-too-short midpoint of the record, “Know,” interpolates the unfinished clause “Before I know you” into various phrases, including the forlorn “It seems to me, that you’d be happier\\/Before I know you.” By playing with these repetitions, Talk to You Soon asks at what point does gazing inward turn from self-reflection to distortion.While Ray’s previous Ricky LP, Three Love Songs, was an ambient record indebted to the KLF’s warped field recordings, Talk to You Soon feels more like impressionistic vignettes about the disparate feelings born out of trauma. From the moment the swirls of “‘hey’” introduce a dizzying volatility, complete with string arrangements from Owen Pallett, there is a nagging sense of discord. It’s the sonic equivalent of when someone says, “Hi, how are you?” and you say “Good!” even though you are moments from a nervous breakdown. The rest of the album roils on from there, and even if we are temporarily distracted by IDM-indebted beats or palliative synth glows, anxiety always looms in the margins.Ray’s piano playing has much to do with Talk to You Soon’s unraveling nerves. On “Spinning About Under the Bright Light in Bliss,” a gentle swell abruptly turns to percussive jabs. The underlying progression remains, but it is beleaguered by shrill notes as though Ray’s left and right hands are at war. “In the Grocery Store,” with its spectral melody, sounds impossibly distant from its mundane namesake and more akin to the title theme of The Exorcist. It’s these discrepancies that remind us that the world inside your head and the one you inhabit can be so unaware of each other. It doesn’t matter if you are in a supermarket, or fucking, or even having a good day—your mind can rebel at any moment.The closest Talk to You Soon comes to a complete psychotic break is the anarchic “As We Speak,” which features abrasive screaming from LA-based post-metal outfit Wreck and Reference. Unlike the unnerving electronics that whirred before, this track is a melting point of hoarse howling, crashing drums, and the wailing of an alarm siren. The acute panic attack lasts for a minute before yielding to an adrenalized heartbeat and veering into nervous percussive twitches. This moment is so abrasive, so intense, that the remainder of the album feels exhausted from its own introspection. Though maybe that’s the point Ray is trying to make here. Nominally, the final two tracks, “On a Good Day” and “‘ok’,” suggest that perhaps we have finally reached some calm after emotional tumult, but their languor recalls the dreary effects of overthinking. Can there be any respite for someone who lives so thoroughly inside their own mind, who is prone to over-analyzing and distorting the past? Although Ricky Eat Acid excels in making supernaturally empathetic music, these final moments of Talk to You Soon are especially isolating, a final warning to the listener that when gazing inward becomes pathological, it casts an endless pall.\"],[22480,\"The afternoon before releasing Keep Flexin, Rich the Kid posted a video of himself dancing to the opening track, “I Don’t Care,” while puffing on a cigar and counting a stack of crisp hundred dollar bills. The video ends abruptly when a fire alarm goes off in the room—Rich freezes and drops his jaw with cartoonish flair before blurting, “Oh shit!” Staged or not, the video more or less sums up Rich the Kid’s playful charm: Here’s a guy who seems perpetually bemused by his own success even as he performs it.Rich the Kid has been a prolific presence in Atlanta rap for a few years now; Keep Flexin marks his seventh solo mixtape since 2013 and that’s not counting his numerous collaborative tapes with Migos, Makonnen, and his Rich Forever label signees. His sound is fairly straightforward by contemporary standards, especially when compared to that of his more distinctive peers like Lil Yachty or Lil Uzi Vert. Still, he’s mastered the fundamentals of Atlanta rap: an ear for melody, a hook better than most, and triplets like he’s the fourth Migo.In keeping with its title, Keep Flexin largely concerns itself with the trappings of wealth and stardom. Aesthetically speaking, Rich’s music can be called street rap, even if these songs feel far removed from the streets. These are light, bubbly anthems, befitting their shallow subject matter. “You hear that? That’s ice,” Rich explains at the outset of “Doors Up,” as he fidgets with his chains over a glimmering synth arpeggio. Airless lead single “Don’t Want Her” is nominally about the dispensability with which Rich views women (see the caustic refrain, “I throw out that bitch ‘cause she garbage”) but even here, he can’t help but boast, “Flexin’ I’m making them vomit\\/The rollie is water, it came out the faucet.” On “Liar Liar,” he jumps on the increasingly crowded bandwagon of Future impersonators, though as always, his outlook remains sunny (“I took a trip to the jeweler\\/I drop my wrist the in cooler”), in contrast to the song’s darker hue.Keep Flexin boasts an impressive roster of guests and for the most part, Rich puts them to good use. Jeremih smooths out the jerky “Greedy” with his gooey hook while matching his host’s braggadocio (“I count paper, don’t read it\\/Call me Mister Big Shot”). “Dat Way” finds Migos in prime form (“Pick up the phone and call Kanye,” Quavo instructs, alluding to Migos’ recent management deal with G.O.O.D. Music) over a twitchy, string-heavy beat. “Going” is essentially just one big Desiigner hook—your mileage here will vary depending on your personal tolerance for unintelligible gurgling and “Brrrrrah!” ad-libs. Disappointingly, Young Thug sounds pretty unengaged on “Ran It Up,” coloring inside the melodic lines that Rich establishes. Still, Thug manages to offer a brief window into his life (“Recording on the back of the bus and I’m po’d up”), evoking a devastating image of his idol from the documentary film The Carter: drugged-out, working feverishly, very much alone.This sort of tension is sorely missing from most of Keep Flexin, a record that’s happy to catalog the perks of being an ascendant rapper while turning a blind eye to the costs. While previous Rich the Kid releases like Trap Talk contrasted the street life that Rich had known with his current plush lifestyle, Keep Flexin offers few such juxtapositions. He does briefly acknowledge previous struggles on “Doors Up,” (“I was just hustling, I wanted a chance”) and on “Blessings,” he stops to take stock of how far he’s come: “I had to learn a lesson\\/Lose it all in a second\\/I made it here that’s a blessing\\/Get the money not stressing\\/You better count your blessings.” Rich the Kid certainly seems to live by that mantra, though he’ll need to dig deeper if he wants others to relate to his journey.\"],[22543,\"Technically speaking, Australian musician Carla dal Forno is a singer-songwriter, but her solo debut album shows her mindset is closer to that of a lighting director or set designer. Where even experimental singer-songwriters privilege vocals and chord progressions, dal Forno emphasizes the marginal details,  to the extent that what we might think of as the “song” at the core of each track either dissolves outright or lingers in the background as a set of out-of-focus shapes.Dal Forno’s approach falls closer in spirit to ambient music. Only one song on You Know What It’s Like emphasizes her voice to the point where you’d consider it the “lead” vocal, and she doesn’t even sing on half the tracks. She obviously takes after Grouper in the way she occupies the sumptuous gloom of her songs like a ghost, but her grandiosity and shamanic presence suggest a subdued modern answer to an outsider-art icon like Moondog.Intro track “Italian Cinema” starts things off on an extravagantly strange note, with layers of sounds resembling the cyclic, serrated rotation of helicopter blades. At times, dal Forno uses found sounds—water pouring from a teapot to introduce “The Same Reply,” a crack of distant lightning at the beginning of “Fast Moving Cars”—to provide hints of setting. But she never lets the sounds eclipse the music's intensive focus on mood. Smoky and ominous, You Know What It’s Like simmers, both musically and thematically, with powerful undercurrents that dal Forno never quite spells out.On “Fast Moving Cars,” the album’s first vocal tune, dal Forno navigates that thorny zone of longing where she’s prodding the object of her affections not to be so passive. “It’s safe to assume that I like you best, so don’t be so frightened,” she sings. Her unassuming place in the mix actually serves the resolve in her voice—once you pick up on it, the album’s gravity becomes hard to deny. Even when dal Forno tips her hat to Nico on “What You Gonna Do Now?,” she still manages to stake out her own territory. Much like other singer-songwriters who march unequivocally to their own drummer, Carla dal Forno is willing to provoke listeners on a number of levels without spoon-feeding them. With You Know What It’s Like, she manages to do so on her own terms, in a way that feels both distant and inviting and rewards the listener’s willingness to sit with the ambiguity in between. \"],[22579,\"Four years ago, in October of 2012, Nadya Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina of Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for “hooliganism” after staging a protest performance in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Pussy Riot leveraged performance and punk rock to critique the Putin regime as well as the Russian Orthodox Church. Although music was initially incidental to the project, Pussy Riot was championed in the Western imagination and among the international pop elite as a band—a characterization made manifest as Tolokno and Alyokhina were writ into riot-grrrl herstory and invited to perform alongside Madonna at a 2014 Amnesty International concert at the Barclays Center upon their release. As of last year, the pair has been releasing music for the music sphere, including the Eric Garner tribute “I Can’t Breathe,” a Le Tigre collaboration made for “House of Cards,” and a pro-refugee track filmed in Banksy’s Dismaland. Now, Tolokno is releasing a solo EP on Atlantic imprint Nice Life, produced by TV on the Radio’s Dave Sitek (who Tolokno also worked with on the chilling anti-corruption track “Chaika”).  Now, in a season where “pussy” has become a household word again, albeit for all the wrong reasons, the original pussy provocateurs have returned to exact their vengeance on macho would-be-rulers the world over. At least, that’s the narrative for Nadya Tolokno’s xxx EP. Working with pop music as a medium makes total sense for Tolokno, considering her irrefutable magnetism and keen understanding of media weaponization as well as the deity-like status with which we imbue pop music icons. That said, it’s disappointing to see the Pussy Riot name, which was built on principles of non-hierarchy, collectivity, and anti-capitalism, leveraged as a personal brand—something she has been critiqued for both by former members of the Pussy Riot collective and by other Russian feminists and activists. (Tolokno maintains that the Pussy Riot name can be taken up by anyone but as one meaning gets reified, the rest dematerialize.) The songs on xxx are a mixed bag. Two of the three tracks are written in English and either directly or indirectly anti-Trump. At a time when “the Russians” are synonymous with Bond villains or election hacking, there’s something thrilling about seeing Tolokno fire back at America’s own villainous tendencies. However, both of these tracks can ring a little hollow. Tolokno has said that “Straight Outta Vagina” was written as a response to patriarchy, misogyny, and the overrepresentation of dicks in pop music. In a phallocentric world where normalized derision of vaginas leads to lifelong body image issues, there’s a reason that Judy Chicago’s Dinner Party is in the Brooklyn Museum’s permanent collection. On the other hand, at a time when genital-centered essentialism is used by to perpetuate violence and to call for violent legislation against trans women, suggesting that only people with vaginas are affected by misogyny feels irresponsibly cis-sexist. Out of all the anti-Trump songs coming out recently, “Make America Great Again” is the most direct. It’s an earworm that’s not quite as disastrous as Le Tigre’s pro-Hillary jingle, though if we’re going by Tolokno’s own criteria (“Let other people in\\/Listen to your women\\/Stop killing black children”) it would be far more accurate to say that America Was Never Great. While the lyrics are relatively low key, the accompanying video is all-out brutal, splicing dystopian footage of real Trump speeches with gruesome imagery of Tolokno being branded, sexually assaulted, and tortured by Trump goons in orange wigs.  One of the more mesmerizing tracks is “Organs,” a deft Russian-language track (English translation can be read by enabling closed captions in YouTube) with Tolokno rapping on the interplay of bodies and the body politic while bathing nude in a tub of blood. “In 2014, I was released from prison and put into a bloody bath,” Tolokno tells The-Village.ru, citing “the annexation of Crimea, the fighting on the territory of Ukraine, the downed Boeing, attacks on political activists (including ourselves), the murder of [liberal politician] Boris Nemtsov.”The inspiration behind “Organs” is a sobering reminder that, burgeoning music profile aside, Tolokno is undertaking tangible, dangerous activism with regards to the Russian prison system. Shortly after getting out, Tolokno and Alyokhina co-founded Zona Prava, (Zone of Rights) an advocacy group meant to provide legal aid and informational support to prisoners, as well as Zona Pravda (Zone of Truth), a media site dedicated to in-depth coverage of courts, prisons, and labor camps, including trials, human rights abuses, hunger strikes. The video for “Straight Outta Vagina” co-stars a young girl in a balaclava, implying the potential of a new generation of feminists. Thinking about the inadequate, cursory coverage that the ongoing prison strike has gotten in American media, I can’t help but hope that the next generation is inspired not just by Tolokno’s fearlessness as a performer but also her fearlessness as an activist.\"],[22576,\"Huerco S.'s music is mostly a process of addition-as-subtraction, piling up layers until the faintest outline of the original forms remains—something like Hans Christian Andersen's “The Princess and the Pea” but with magnetic tape in place of feather mattresses. Obscure shapes lurk beneath a dark, oil-slicked surface, and when they poke their heads out of the murk, the glimpse you get is like a grainy photo of the Loch Ness Monster—mostly just shadows and guesswork.On this cassette for New York's Quiet Time, he takes the technique to a new extreme. These objects, whatever they may be, have disappeared far beneath the surface, until even their shadows have dissolved into the cold water, and all that is left is the merest ripple on the surface. In keeping with the series' emphasis on long-form pieces, the tape consists of just one track. It is 31 minutes long, and at first it seems to consist of nothing more than a single held chord run through subtle effects. The other tapes in the series, by Aquarian, Baby, and Money, tend to be structured more like mixtapes. Aquarian's veers between drone, footwork, and acid; Baby, a Los Angeles trio of RISD grads, massage bassy rumble, heavy metal samples, and massing choirs into an ominous and enveloping head trip.Huerco S.'s tape is the softest of any of them so far, but with its unrelenting focus, it conveys a different kind of intensity. Turn it up loud enough and its atmospheres are all-enveloping; they invite you to dissolve into them. The longer and more intently you listen, the more detail opens up, although “detail” might not be the right word for a sound like this, worn smooth as limestone. But somewhere, deep down beneath all that reverb, the chord occasionally modulates, and slowly shifting EQ variously highlights different parts of the spectrum: swollen bass, burnished midrange, and bright, silvery highs.The Kansas City-raised, New York-based musician has done something like this before on Colonial Patterns' “ChunKee Player,” in which reverb, EQ, and tape compression sanded down the contours of a slow-moving chord progression—maybe strings, maybe synths, maybe something else entirely—to a pebbly blur. But that sketch wasn't even two minutes long, and it still betrayed the hint of a pulse. Drawing out the technique half an hour's length and pacing its changes in extreme slow motion exert an entirely different kind of force on the listener. It is a kind of deep-freeze ambient; it is beautiful in a way that tends to obliterate distinctions. Depending upon your mood, you may find it calming, gloomy, or perhaps even strangely emotionally blank. It is an empty shell around a fathomless, sourceless echo. There are no musical events to speak of, no attacks, no moments of distinction; just remnants of sounds, a memory of where a sound once was, like something heard from the other end of a long, dark tunnel that you no longer remember how to find your way back across.\"],[22569,\"“We’re hoping that this be one of the greatest albums that ever come out.”Otis Redding says these words just before launching into “Respect” on April 8, 1966, wrapping up the first of seven sets he’d play over the course of three days at Los Angeles’ Whisky A Go Go. A few songs earlier, he first informed the crowd that they were recording the concert with plans of releasing it as an album, playing the newly-written “Good to Me” for the second time in nine songs simply because it was the single and they needed to get it right. For his ’66 stint at the Whisky A Go Go, he was backed by his road band, the Otis Redding Revue—a ten-piece group similar to the bands who supported him whenever he toured the south. This is the residency that is captured in its entirety on Stax’s six-disc box Live at the Whisky A Go Go: the Complete Recordings.Redding’s residency was a deliberate attempt on the part of the singer and his management to move him out of the Chitlin Circuit and into the mainstream. The idea wasn’t to have Otis record pop music, but rather bring his act straight to the rock audience. So they set up shop right on the Sunset Strip, home to such hip rock‘n’rollers as the Byrds, Love, the Turtles and the Doors, figuring there was no better place to introduce Redding to a white audience.Otis managed that crossover but not at the Whisky. It happened later at the Monterey International Pop Festival in ’67—backed then by Stax\\/Volt house band Booker T. & the M.G.’s—because he benefitted from the festival setting. In the open air, excitement spreads like fire. Indoors there is a different dynamic, particularly if it’s a crowd confronted with something they’ve never seen before, which was certainly the case of the Los Angelinos that headed to the Whisky to see Otis Redding that April weekend in 1966. Once Otis hit the stage on April 8, the applause was polite but not enthusiastic. He had to work to win that crowd, which he does by the end of the set, by which point they’re cheering “Respect.” At that point, Redding wasn’t unknown, particularly in R&B quarters—he had three Billboard R&B Top 10s, with a fourth soon to follow—but such gutbucket soul shows simply weren’t played in mainstream rock venues like the Whisky A Go Go.That alone made the three nights at the Whisky a step forward from Redding, who was hungry to become a star on his own terms. But the concerts alone weren’t the main thing: These shows were designed to be the primary source for an album, one that could capture the raw power of Redding on wax and hopefully bring in a wider audience. Throughout the seven full sets captured on Live at the Whisky A Go Go: the Complete Recordings—a box that doubles Stax’s 2010 set Live on the Sunset Strip, which contains about half of the sets from that April ’66 stint—Redding reminds the audience they’re cutting a record and, in a way, the sets are structured as recording sessions. Over the course of the seven shows, “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” is played no fewer than ten times, a sure sign that Redding wanted to be sure he nailed this song for the album. A few other songs appear nearly that often (“I Can’t Turn You Loose,” “Good to Me”) but he also made sure to play almost every song he and his Revue knew, throwing in covers of James Brown’s “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” and the Beatles’ “A Hard Day’s Night” along the way—anything that could snag new listeners.Once Volt\\/Atco heard the tapes, they decided the performances were too raw to release. Not only was fidelity poor, but the band sometimes seemed ragged, veering out of tune and maybe not locking in on a groove. Stax\\/Volt founder Jim Stewart decided to shelve the record for reason, bringing out a version of it ’68 called In Person at the Whisky A Go Go only after Otis had died and the market demanded more Otis. The Whisky A Go Go tapes served that very purpose over the years, popping up on vinyl in 1982 as Recorded Live and almost a decade later on CD as Good to Me: Live at the Whisky A Go Go, Vol. 2, with some tracks popping up as bonus tracks on a 2008 deluxe edition of 1965’s Otis Blue. The double-disc Live on the Sunset Strip seeming like the last word in 2010.Live at the Whisky A Go Go: the Complete Recordings, however, trumps them all. It simultaneously emphasizes the consistency of Redding and his Revue along with their quirks. Listening to the sets back to back, it’s hard to hear where the band allegedly strays off path: Whatever flaws that may exist in a given track tend to melt away in the context of a full set. There’s an electricity to the performances even when they bring the tempo down for the slow-burners, and a great thing about this box is that there’s plenty of space for the band to play. On the 1968 LP, the longest number topped out just over five minutes but here performances routinely clock in between six and eight minutes, giving the band room to vamp while Otis works the crowd. It’s not only invigorating, but it suggests how Redding’s southern soul was tied to James Brown’s nascent funk. Listen to how he closes out Saturday’s first set with a marathon eight-minute “Satisfaction” then picks up the next set with the same song, stretching this version out to nine minutes via interlocking horn solos—it’s nearly 17 minutes of white-hot down-home vamping that is earthier than Brown and the J.B.’s but undoubtedly comes from the same source.Nevertheless, the greatest thing Live at the Whisky A Go Go: the Complete Recordings offers is so much vital live soul from an era where the sound was in its prime but was rarely recorded. Perhaps Booker T & the M.G.’s were a tighter outfit than the Otis Redding Revue, but the rawness heard on Live at the Whisky A Go Go: the Complete Recordings has its own singular virtues, particularly because so little of these southern soul acts were recorded in the ’60s. That alone would make this a worthy historical document but, better still, it remains exceptional because it captured a moment when a premiere showman worked his hardest to win over new fans. Decades later, these 1966 concerts at the Whisky A Go Go still possess the power to convert skeptics so seems that Otis Redding did indeed get his wish: He made one of the greatest albums that ever came out.\"],[22556,\"The self-titled debut from the Olympians is a quintessential Daptone Records release, featuring many of the label’s best musicians as commissioned by the pianist and vibraphonist Toby Pazner. Pazner has played on many Daptone records himself, but he’s also occupied a Daptone-adjacent space as the keyboardist for the soul singer Lee Fields and others. That Aloe Blacc “I Need A Dollar” song you couldn’t escape—or stop listening to—in 2010? It was Pazner who played the signature piano take. As a listener, there’s a certain delight in chasing down session musicians in an album’s credits and threading together their careers. In jazz especially, that type of context is rewarding, knowing that this guy played with that guy and is now leading his own thing with both of them involved. This is the position Pazner is in with the Olympians, commanding a group of regulars that includes members of the Dap-Kings, Lee Fields’ band, and other players like Michael Leonhart, a noted trumpet prodigy who directs Steely Dan’s band and was formerly a house player for the now-defunct label Truth and Soul Records. The Olympians is a Pazner pet project years in the making: piling these instrumentalists on top of each other, boxing them in with smart arrangements, and then letting them out to play. A lot of The Olympians will sound familiar to Daptone devotees, but Pazner sneaks some ambitious switch-ups into a form frequently tied to grooves, and the addition of a sparse string section lends some space and delicacy to the sound. The usual discrete building blocks are never far: chugging wah-wah guitar, a persistently syncopated horn section, impeccable percussion. Halfway through “Venus,” a characteristically lush track that leans on bowing sideline strings, the song breaks in half—silent in the middle—to reveal a bumbling, then barking, then breathy, then rambling trumpet solo I’ve listened to dozens of times. Pazner smartly deploys dexterous solos like this throughout: an airy flute cuts through the end of the swampy funk opener “Sirens of Jupiter”; the reverse delay guitar on “Mars” achieves a measured psychedelic effect in contrast to the grace of the harp runs.There are riffs on the album that feel pleasantly misplaced or slyly repurposed, barely recognizable in their new setting. “Sirens of Jupiter” features a tucked away but recurring single-note vibraphone step down that jolts back to Menahan Street Band’s “Tired of Fighting.” Pazner, unsurprisingly, played the instrument on both songs. Later, “Europa and the Bull” opens with a first-generation drum machine ping and sighing guitar twang that evokes Shuggie Otis on Inspiration Information. The Olympians also sometimes tries to do too much: When “Mars” gives way to “Neptune,” a slowly uplifting number that almost floats away, it sounds like a heart-attack inducing cop chase scene that cuts into a happy-ending montage. The transitions between songs sometimes feel jostled together or even like sequencing mistakes. Still, like good session musicians, the Olympians never sound out of pocket. Pazner has a fever-dream like backstory for The Olympians that explains the mythical band name and song titles, as if this were soul music for or from the Greek Gods. Perhaps it’s a more compelling narrative than “yet another Daptone instrumental funk album,” but that latter tagline is trustworthy for a reason. The label’s house sound isn’t borne out of try-hard duplication as much as a finely tuned cast; Pazner has exemplified that approach and added some flair with a string section and his own ear. A few years ago the Daptone co-founder and engineer Gabriel Roth fessed up to a studio secret in an interview with the trade publication Sound On Sound. “The sound you want really is coming from the musicians,” he said. “And when guys have played together for a while it's not a strain to get a good sound.” Pazner knows this stay-out-of-the-way tactic well, and the Olympians make their toughest tricks sound effortless because of it.\"],[22575,\"Since his last major-label release, 2015’s Dreams Worth More Than Money, Meek Mill has been anything but silent. He put out a two-part EP (4\\/4), and fired up an assortment of beefs with Drake, the Game, Joe Budden, and 50 Cent. The largest course, of course, was with Drake, a Mean Girls meme-war that left Meek’s credibility so pummeled that fast-food chains felt safe enough to roast him. Even his MMG Boss Rick Ross distanced himself from his once proud protege (“I never took an L back when Meek fell…”). If nothing else, his next LP would be his best chance to define the next chapter in his story.But that LP, DC4, inspires more questions than answers. It’s ostensibly a mixtape, but it’s for sale on iTunes, suggesting the samples were cleared. Conceptually, it’s the fourth in his Dreamchasers series, a concept that defines both his side ventures and his identity. Meek’s struggle is quintessentially American. With the deck stacked against him from day one, his American Dream was laser-focused on climbing out of the South Philadelphia ghetto that claimed his father’s life. His Philly heroes in the State Property crew rapped as tough as they looked, and his hip-hop education played out on street cornersHe brings that energy to every one of his songs, and DC4 is no different. Taking a cue from Nas & Puffy, he starts off with nothing less dramatic than the “O Fortuna”-sampling “On the Regular,” produced by Lex Luger protege MP808. The opening bars serve as a prologue for the rest of the record, listing the things he will rap about: selling dope, going to court, wearing jewelry, drinking alcohol, having sex, smoking high-quality marijuana. Or as he puts it, “Stickin’ to the basics.” And if there’s a knock on Meek, it’s just that—he’s basic. Struggle rappers are constantly underestimated, dropping countless releases, scrapping for every ounce of recognition they can get. After more than a dozen releases, Meek Mill is really just a struggle rapper that made it. If he started from the bottom, now that he’s here, what else does he have to say?Not much, it turns out. Meek’s beat selection has always been impressive, especially considering his prolific output. And DC4 may have benefitted further from the relatively delayed release; The track list is loaded from top to bottom with bangers from young producers such as Sound M.O.B. (“Litty”) and the 808 Mafia. The features are a good indication of the sound he’s adopted, with guest appearances from Lil Uzi Vert, Young Thug, 21 Savage, and Migos’ Quavo. He takes a welcome left turn with the blues-guitar driven “Blue Notes,” built off a Snowy White sample, and puts on up-and-coming R&B crooner Guordan Banks with the Pusha T-featuring “Two Wrongs.”But when it comes to his rhymes, there’s little variety in his style. No matter the tone or mood of the beat he’s rhyming over, his rhymes are yelled rather than rapped. He’s 2016’s version of Bad Boy’s “Madd Rapper”—mad cuz he’s not getting enough “Shine,” mad cuz he didn’t get a tweet from the game’s biggest star. His energy at shows, honed from years of street-corner battles, is infectious. But on record, with his volume always cranked to 10, it really only works in small doses. And while he’s capable of detail-rich narratives, he never manages to focus on any one thought long enough to say anything of substance. Even the serial story of “Tony Story 3” is mired in hoary gangsta tropes.On DC4, Meek Mill is caught between his old life and his new one. His history with actual “gangsta shit” may have boosted his credibility—and profile—but now, it seems to be holding him back. He’s still prone to the occasional exhibition of garden-variety homophobia, but at least since he’s been in a relationship with Nicki Minaj, there’s been a noticeable reduction in misogyny. He almost certainly would love to graduate from his tough-guy street persona, but it’s as if he feels his core audience won’t let him. “You can't be hard all the time, man,” he told Billboard in an interview last year. “There's both sides to everything. What's wrong with it? Jay Z was a street rapper and he had a girlfriend.”He’s clearly thinking about how these pieces of his life fit into the larger struggle, but DC4 merely hints at powerful, ugly truths. The album’s cover is a collage of court documents (including his plea agreement) and a mug shot of an 18-year-old Meek, his face bandaged and eye swollen after a beat down from black cops. But he went harder on Funkmaster Flex’s Hot 97 show than he does on record, eloquently questioning the morality of the prison system and Flint’s poisoned water. Time will tell if Meek’s legacy outlasts the embarrassing Drake episode, as the only questions DC4 has answered are related to how he’d like his famous friends to promote his new record. But as an MC, Meek’s considerable potential remains untapped.\"],[22554,\"Freedom Jazz Dance, the latest volume in Columbia Legacy’s Miles Davis Bootleg Series, opens with a discussion. It’s October 24, 1966, and Miles and bassist Ron Carter are working out a bass line until Miles interrupts and scolds him gently: “No,” Miles rasps, “that’s too common. C’mon.” Carter at one point says, “I don’t understand.” Miles continues on, “Play E diminished…start with a B flat,” and finally, to producer Teo Macero in the control room, he says, as he does again and again on this set, “Play that, Teo.”After eleven takes—and twenty-three minutes of talk, rehearsal, and some ball-breaking—Miles, along with Carter, saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams (famously known as the “Second Great Quintet”), embark on the master of Eddie Harris’ soul-jazz number “Freedom Jazz Dance” that would appear the following year on the album Miles Smiles. In fact, each of the six tracks on Miles Smiles are broken down, pored over, and built back up by the musicians and the producers of this set (Steve Berkowitz, Michael Cuscuna, and Richard Seidel), who have unearthed outtakes, false starts, and, for the first time, studio dialogue. Virtually two-thirds of this three-CD set is the making of—and love letter to—his 1967 album Miles Smiles, one of his finest works that’s often overlooked in “best-of” Miles shortlists. The rest of Freedom Jazz Dance includes reels of material that would later appear on Nefertiti and Water Babies. The alternate takes and the lively banter plop you right there in the studio as the artistic process unfolds. It’s what differentiates Freedom Jazz Dance from past volumes of this enthralling series, which were all live concerts that showed how Miles’s groups evolved on the bandstand. Here the studio is the laboratory—and what a studio, the storied 30th Street Studio, a converted Armenian Evangelical Church between Second and Third Avenue, where Kind of Blue was recorded seven years earlier. Though compared to what the new quintet was up to by 1966, Kind of Blue sounds almost quaint.The dialogue on this set is often profane (“That was a motherfucker!”; “Don’t sit up there giggling, cocksucker!”); sometimes tedious (“Wayne, what’s happening? You want a drink? Want a hamburger?”); but usually mineral-rich. “Hey Wayne,” Miles says, this time in his brownstone on West 77th Street, “I was thinking about writing a blues…like in F and then going to A-flat, you know?” before he tinkers with the idea on an electric piano. During a take of “Orbits,” he says, “Don’t rush it, Tony.” On “Gingerbread Boy”: “Herbie, don’t play chords on your left hand, just your right hand.” Miles is nurturing, but very much the boss. While working through “Dolores,” he says to Herbie, “Don’t play nothin’ until you’re ready to play,” to which Hancock answers, “You don’t want that thing in there? I thought it was cute.” Miles says, “I don’t.\\\\\"One could argue that this volume is superfluous (“Give Wayne half of that hamburger, Bobby”). New listeners to jazz or to Miles Davis particularly might be disoriented, especially if they don’t recognize the voices of the band members or understand the significance of Teo Macero. (“Teee-o? Teee-o?” “I need moral support Teo—immoral.”) For the uninitiated, Miles Smiles, Nefertiti, and The Bootleg Series, Vol. I are almost certainly better places to start.Who knows how Miles Davis himself would even feel about this. Would he want the outtakes included? The banter? In his 1989 autobiography, he wrote of these years: “I made six studio dates with this group in four years….We recorded much more than what was released….And there were some live recordings that I guess Columbia will release when they think they can make the most money—probably after I’m dead.” But one could also argue the exact opposite, that this set is found treasure, especially to Miles completists, enthusiasts, musicians, and students. The producers don’t take jazz or Miles Davis fans lightly, or as ATMs. This documentation underscores the artistic process of one of American music’s most seminal bands. You can hear how the Wayne Shorter-penned “Footprints,” maybe the highlight of Miles Smiles, went from a slower tempo to the perfectly paced, ethereal master take. Or Tony Williams, just 20 in October 1966, go from great to spectacular by the session-reel outtake of “Nefertiti” eight months later. He’s equally mesmerizing on a rhythm section rehearsal of “Country Son,” as is Carter.It’s been a big year for Miles Davis. In April, there was Don Cheadle’s biopic Miles Ahead, accompanied by Robert Glasper’s original score and his additional tribute album Everything’s Beautiful, which included Erykah Badu, Laura Mvula, and Bilal; Prestige reissued a box set of his early 1950s recordings on 10-inch vinyl; he has a presence in the brand new National Museum of African American History and Culture. May would have been his 90th birthday; September marked 25 years since he passed. Even a Scotch whiskey called Kind of Blue, in honor of Miles, launched in August.If there’s a drawback to the ongoing releases and reissues from Miles Davis, it’s that it can steer attention away from jazz musicians on the vibrant scene today. Not that they shouldn’t welcome it; there will always be a lot to glean from Miles’ canon. And there will likely still be more finds from his Columbia vaults; his early-mid 1980s’ work, for instance, hasn’t been sifted through yet. That’s a good thing. There will always be something to look back —and forward—to.\"],[22528,\"Leipzig's Gunnar Wendel, better known as Kassem Mosse, has built up a tidy reputation as one of leftfield dance music's most respected figures while keeping his person completely out of the equation. Despite using a number of aliases—KMOS, Paid Reach, Seltene Erden, the Siege of Troy—Wendel has never made an effort to stay anonymous, exactly. He's never cultivated mystique, never used his aliases as a shield. (That might precisely be the reason he's been spared the scrutiny that Burial's William Bevan has faced.) He sits for the occasional interview, though there doesn't seem to have been a new one in English in five years, and speaks thoughtfully and in great detail about his processes and his philosophy. He even maintains a Facebook page. Yet he's clearly content to remain at arm's length from contemporary dance music culture. He prefers living in Leipzig to joining the crowded techno scene in Berlin, and it makes sense; music like his requires a certain measure of isolation.Even at its most straightforward, there's always been an element of mystery in Wendel's work. Loping house grooves may trundle ahead at 120 BPM—he's no stranger to the floor-filling anthem—but the background swims with wraithlike shapes, with creaks and clanks. Figuring out how a given track may have been made is largely guesswork, and largely irrelevant, too. The elements in his music seem less a matter of intention than tidal happenstance, like barnacle-studded scraps of plastic washed up on the beach after a storm.Wendel used to specialize in beaten-up and broken-down house, favoring figures suggestive of a note hastily scribbled in the dark—the torn scrap of crumpled paper bag smoothed flat against the knee of someone's Levi's, the ballpoint pen poking halfway through the rough, pulpy edge—yet still legible as dance music. But he has increasingly abandoned dancefloor conventions as he has moved further out. On Disclosure, his first album for London's Honest Jon's label, and his first long-form studio output since 2014's Workshop 19, he might be mistaken for an entirely different artist than the one who produced warm, bittersweet tunes like “578” and “Thalassocalyce.”The album covers plenty of ground, from his typical slow-motion house ruminations to tumbling, footwork-tempo dynamos, but nearly half the album's tracks are thorny synthesizer sketches—fistfuls of gurgle and ping, sometimes beatless, sometimes accompanied by tangled drum-machine patterns that tie the math-processing parts of the cortex up in knots. The opening “Stepping on Salt” gives us an idea of the kinds of tones to expect: sizzling, squelching analog waveforms yoked to broken-clock arpeggios over which the spirits of Daphne Oram and Delia Derbyshire loom large.Even the most overtly rhythmic cuts here warily skirt the edges of the dancefloor. “Phoenicia Wireless” is the kind of pensive, toe-scuffing house track that Wendel can probably crank out in his sleep, but the beat doesn't start up in earnest until nearly two-thirds of the way through, and it's forever on the verge of being swallowed up by hi-hat bursts that clatter like mid-century newsroom typewriters. Woe to the careless DJ who throws on “Aluminosilicate Mirrors” without taking a good, hard listen first: A few minutes in, the tempo starts drifting upward without warning, turning the frenetic footwork groove even more hair-raising.“Collapsing Dual Core” is one of the album's fastest, most unencumbered cuts, playing contrapuntal synthesizer lines against a TR-707 programming, and there's no arrangement to speak of, just a ceaseless series of tweaks to a few fixed patterns—a live jam par excellence. It tells you a lot about Wendel's method. Many musicians might have used what he's assembled here as the building blocks for something more finessed; they might have added more elements, woven emotive samples into the mix, teased out a harmony or two. Not Wendel: What you hear is what you get, and even the spindliest, most skeletal jam is exactly that and nothing more. It has no interest in meeting you halfway.And that's one of the things that's so weirdly satisfying about Disclosure: It feels honest, and it feels true to the standards that Wendel has set for himself throughout his career. For all its quirks and austerity, Disclosure doesn't feel like the work of someone who's being intentionally difficult. He's simply following his own path. The rest of us are free to follow if we wish.\"],[22540,\"The Dillinger Escape Plan’s blend of extreme harshness and technicality had a seismic impact on the metal and hardcore underground with the release of their 1999 full-length debut Calculating Infinity. Not unlike those ’90s-era hidden-image 3D posters, the New Jersey quintet’s transfiguration of progressive metal influences like Meshuggah, Carcass, Human Remains, and Deadguy required a cognitive shift to recognize the detail and structural complexity under all the noise. From that point on, DEP have shown a hunger for pushing boundaries while attempting to stay true to their essence.Every post-Calculating Dillinger Escape Plan album has contained head-scratching deviations from the original sound, something founding guitarist Ben Weinman and the original lineup once defined so clearly. By their last two albums, Option Paralysis and One of Us Is the Killer, the band had settled into marrying their signature mathcore style with high concentrations of melody and mid-tempo groove. As capably as they had found a middle ground, those albums pointed to a holding pattern. Dissociation, the band’s sixth and final album, touches often on the now-familiar template of pounding, grindcore-level noise flurries that once shook the world. Of course, Dillinger Escape Plan take sharp turns away from that template as well—often in the same song.Dissociation hits its stride when the band grafts new elements onto its classic sound—something that, for all their chops, hasn’t been easy to pull off in the past. In one four-song stretch, Dillinger Escape Plan stride across a variety of styles as confidently as the one they invented. “Fugue,” the first of those four tracks, tastefully emulates Squarepusher’s hyper-busy brand of synthetic future jazz before opening up into a vista of delicate, gloomy ambiance. “Fugue” makes you wish that Dillinger Escape Plan did a few more Aphex Twin covers or collaborate on a split with Squarepusher. It’s the first of several reminders that they are leaving some untapped potential on the table as they close out their career. On “Low Feels Blvd,” DEP’s familiar spazz-out crunch morphs into a grand jazz fusion section that you’d otherwise mistake for a Pat Metheny or John McLaughlin record. Not since Candiria’s heyday have extreme metal and jazz sounded like they belong together—a huge achievement for a band that built its reputation on sheer angularity. The song also stands out for how much vocalist Greg Puciato sounds genuinely unhinged. When Puciatio replaced original frontman Dimitri Minakakis in time for 2004’s sophomore full-length Miss Machine, he immediately increased the band’s threshold for melody, but he had to wait until after the Mike Patton collaboration EP Irony Is a Dead Scene to show the world his range. Unfairly or not, Puciato will continue to draw comparisons to Patton, especially on songs like “Surrogate,” where Dillinger scrapes close to Mr. Bungle\\/Faith No More’s bastardizations of Broadway-esque schmaltz.Nevertheless, “Surrogate” demonstrates how, somewhere along the way, Dillinger learned how to stop stacking changes in its songs just for effect. As “Surrogate” rolls from one style to the next—grindcore, a crashing downtempo section, film noir—the mood shifts convincingly as well. Where Dillinger once tossed styles around as if changing costumes, now they actually get into character. In flashes, the band still comes up with fresh sounds. “Honeysuckle,” for example, adopts a Latin-flavored grind as though Latin music had originated from some extra-terrestrial psychology.One of the things that made early DEP music so compelling was the way it conveyed the horrific malaise lurking behind the generic monoculture of the band’s native New Jersey suburbs—a sound so ugly grown out of a soulless environment. Now, the Dillinger Escape Plan aren’t anchored in a time or place, but that isn’t something the band has any control over. It’s a blessing and a curse that they will be forever synonymous with a particular period in hardcore and metal history. In subtle ways, Dissociation reminds us that the band hung in there long after the world could have passed it by.\"],[22374,\"Out of all the fascinating alternate takes, B-sides, rare compilation-only tracks and never-before-released sketches that comprise this expanded reissue of Public Image Ltd’s post-punk landmark, it’s a live version of “Public Image”  that is the real revelation. Part of an impromptu June 1979 concert in Manchester, the song keeps collapsing and restarting. “Shut up!” snaps John Lydon, responding  to audience jeers. “I told you it’s a fucking rehearsal.” Another PiL member explains that the drummer, Richard Dudanski, only joined three days ago. PiL relaunch the song only for Lydon to halt it with “Miles too fast!” The jeers erupt again and the singer offers a sort of defiant apology: if the crowd really wanted to “see mega light displays and all that shit,” they should go watch properly professional bands who put on a slick show. “But we ain’t like that... We’re extremely honest: sorry about that... We admit our mistakes.”This performance—an inadvertent deconstruction of performance itself—takes us to the heart of the PiL project as well as the post-punk movement for which the group served as figureheads. At its core was a belief in radical honesty: faith in the expressive power of words, singing and sound as vehicles for urgent communication. After the Sex Pistols’ implosion, Lydon was trying to find a way to be a public figure again without masks, barriers, routines, or constraining expectations. So it’s especially apt that “Public Image”—PiL’s debut single, Lydon’s post-Pistols mission-statement—is the song that  fell apart at Manchester’s Factory Club. “Public Image” is about the way a stage persona can become a lie that a performer is forced to live out in perpetuity. Lydon sings about “Johnny Rotten” as a theatrical role that trapped him and which he’s now casting off. Starting all over with his given name and a new set of musical accomplices, Lydon was determined to stay true to himself. The group’s name came from Muriel Sparks’ novel The Public Image, about a movie actress whose career is ruined but who, the ending hints, is freed to embark on an authentic post-fame existence. Lydon added the “limited” to signify both the idea of the rock group as a corporation (in the business of image-construction) and the idea of keeping egos on a tight leash. A comparison for Lydon’s search for a new true music—and a truly new music—that would leave behind rock’s calcified conventions is Berlin-era Bowie’s quest for a “new music night and day” (the working title of Low). Indeed it was Virgin Records’ belief that Lydon was the most significant British rock artist since Bowie that caused them to extend PiL such extraordinary license and largesse when it came to recording in expensive studios. That indulgence enabled the recording of three of the most out-there albums ever released by a major label: First Issue, Metal Box, Flowers of Romance. But it’s the middle panel of the triptych that is the colossal achievement:  a near-perfect record that reinvents and renews rock in a manner that fulfilled post-punk’s promise(s) to a degree rivaled only by Joy Division on Closer.The key word, though, is reinvention. Lydon talked grandly of abandoning rock altogether,  arguing that killing off the genre had been the true point of punk. But unlike the absolutely experimental (and as with many such experiments, largely unsuccessful) Flowers of Romance, Metal Box doesn’t go beyond rock so much as stretch it to its furthest extent, in the manner of the Stooges’ Fun House or Can’s Tago Mago. It’s a forbidding listen, for sure, but only because of its intensity, not because it’s abstract or structurally convoluted. The format is classic: guitar-bass-drums-voice (augmented intermittently by keyboards and electronics). The rhythm section (Jah Wobble and a succession of drummers) is hypnotically steady and physically potent. The guitarist (Keith Levene) is a veritable axe-hero, as schooled and as spectacular as any of the pre-punk greats. And the singer, while unorthodox and edging off-key, pours it all out in a searing catharsis that recalls nothing so much as solo John Lennon and the intersection he found between the deeply personal and the politically universal. There are even a few tunes here! But yes, it’s a bracing listen, Metal Box, and nowhere more so than on the opening dirge “Albatross.” 11 minutes-long, leaden in tempo, the song is clearly designed as a test for the listener just like the protracted assault of “Theme” that launched First Issue had been. Absolutely pitiless music—Levene hacking at his axe like an abattoir worker, Wobble rolling out a looped tremor of a bassline—is matched with utterly piteous singing: Lydon intones accusations about an oppressive figure from his past, perhaps the master-manipulator McLaren, possibly his dead friend Vicious, conceivably “Johnny Rotten” himself as a burden he can’t shake. “Memories,” the single that preceded Metal Box’s November ’79 release, is more sprightly. Like “Albatross,” though, the song is an embittered exorcism: Lydon could almost be commenting on his own nagging vocal and fixated lyrics with the line “dragging on and on and on and on and on and on and ON,” then spits out “This person’s had enough of useless memories” over a breath-taking disco-style breakdown. With “Swan Lake,” a retitled remix of the single “Death Disco,” Lydon is possessed by an unbearable memory that he doesn’t want to forget: the sight of his mother dying in slow agony from cancer.  If the wretched grief of the lyrics—“Silence in her eyes,” “Final in a fade,” “Choking on a bed\\/Flowers rotting dead”—recalls Lennon’s “Mother,” the retching anguish of Lydon’s vocal resembles Yoko Ono at her most abrasively unleashed. On the original vinyl, the song locks into an endless loop on the phrase “words cannot express.” But “Swan Lake”—named after the Tchaikovsky melody that Levene intermittently mutilates—is nothing if not a 20th Century expressionist masterpiece: the missing link between Munch’s “The Scream” and Black Flag’s “Damaged I.”Just as placing “death” in front of “disco” was an attempt to subvert the idea of dancefloor escapism, the title “Poptones” drips with acrid irony. A real-life news story of abduction, rape and escape inspired the lyric, with one detail in particular triggering Lydon’s imagination: the victim’s memory of the bouncy music streaming out of the car’s cassette player. This juxtaposition of  manufactured happiness and absolute horror is a typically post-punk move, exposing pop as a prettified lie that masks reality’s raw awfulness: for some post-punk groups,  an existential condition (dread, doubt) and for others, a political matter (exploitation, control). On “Poptones” this truth-telling impulse produces one of Lydon’s most vivid lyrics (“I don’t like hiding in this foliage and peat\\/It’s wet and I’m losing my body heat”), supported and surrounded by music that’s surprisingly pretty, in an eerie, insidious sort of way. Wobble’s sinuously winding bass weaves through Levene’s cascading sparks as well as the cymbal-smash spray he also supplies (PiL being temporarily drummerless during this stage of the album’s spasmodic recording). With PiL still between drummers, on “Careering” it’s Wobble who doubles up roles, pummeling your ribcage with his bass and bashing the kit like a metalworker pounding flat a sheet of steel. Levene swaps guitar for smears of synth, while Lydon’s helicopter vision scans the border zone between Ulster and the Irish Republic: a terrorscape of “blown into breeze” bomb victims and paramilitary paranoia. “Careering” sounds like nothing else in rock and nothing else in PiL’s work—as with several other songs on Metal Box, it could have spawned a whole identity, an entire career, for any other band. “No Birds Do Sing,” unbelievably, surpasses the preceding five songs. Levene cloaks the murderous Wobble-Dudanksi groove with a toxic cloud of guitar texture. Lydon surveys an English suburban scene whose placidity could not be further from troubled Northern Ireland, noting in sardonic approval its “bland planned idle luxury” and “well-intentioned rules” (rolling the ‘r’ there in a delicious throwback to classic Rotten-style singing). For “a layered mass of subtle props” and “a caviar of silent dignity” alone, Lydon ought to have the 2026 Nobel locked down. After the greatest six-song run in all of post-punk, Metal Box’s remainder is merely (and mostly) excellent, moving from the juddery instrumental “Graveyard” (oddly redolent of Johnny Kidd and the Pirates’ early British rock‘n’roll classic “Shakin’ All Over”) through the rubbery bassline waddle of “The Suit” to the stampeding threat of “Chant,” a savage snapshot of 1979’s tribal street violence. The album winds down with the unexpected respite and repose of “Radio Four,” a tranquil instrumental entirely played by Levene: just a tremulously poignant and agile bass line overlaid with reedy keyboards that swell and subside. The title comes from the U.K.’s national public radio station, a civilized and calming source of news, views, drama and light comedy beamed out to the British middle classes. As with “Poptones,” the irony is astringent.  Listening to (and reviewing) Metal Box in a linear sequence goes against PiL’s original intent, of course. As the flatly descriptive, deliberately demystified title indicates, Metal Box initially came in the form of a circular canister containing three 45 r.p.m  12-inches—for better sound, but also to encourage listeners to play the record in any order they chose,  ideally listening to it in short bursts rather than in a single sitting.  But what once seemed radically anti-rockist (“deconstruct the Album!”) is now a historical footnote, because anyone listening to a CD or other digital format can rearrange the contents however they wish.  And if you do doggedly listen to Metal Box in accordance with its given running order, what comes across strongly now is its sheer accumulative power as an album. That in turn accentuates the feeling that this is a record that can be understood fairly easily by a fan of, say, Led Zeppelin. It works on the same terms as Zoso:  a thematically coherent suite of physically imposing rhythm, virtuoso guitar violence, and impassioned singing. Lydon would soon enough ‘fess up to his latent rockism on 1986’s hard-riffing Album (also reissued as a deluxe box set at this time) on which he collaborated with Old Wave musos like ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker. That incarnation of PiL even performed Zep’s “Kashmir” in concert. Listening to Metal Box today, the studio processing—informed by PiL’s love of disco and dub—that felt so striking at the time seems subtle and relatively bare-bones compared to today. As the Manchester concert and some wonderfully vivid live-in-the-studio versions from the BBC rock program “The Old Grey Whistle Test” prove, PiL could recreate this music onstage (despite that fumbled “Public Image”).  Levene, especially, was surprisingly exact when it came to reproducing the guitar parts and textures captured in the studio. Even the band’s debts to reggae and funk can be seen now as a continuation of the passion for black music that underpinned the British rock achievement of the ’60s and first-half of the ’70s—that perennial impulse to embrace the formal advances made by R&B and complicate them further while adding Brit-bohemian concerns as subject matter. If PiL’s immediate neighbors are the Pop Group and the Slits, you could also slot them alongside the Police: great drummer(s), roots-feel bass, inventively textured guitar, a secret prog element (Levene loved Yes, Lydon adored Peter Hammill) and an emotional basis in reggae’s yearnings and spiritual aches. Metal Box is a landmark, for sure. But like Devils Tower, the mountain in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, it’s an oddly isolated one. In marked contrast to Joy Division, PiL’s spawn was neither legion nor particularly impressive (apart from San Francisco’s wonderful Flipper). Nor would PiL’s core three ever come close to matching the album’s heights in their subsequent careering (Wobble being the most productive, in both copiousness and quality). I was apprehensive about listening to this album again, fearing that it had faded or dated. But this music still sounds new and still sounds true to me: as adventurous and as harrowingly heart-bare as it did when I danced in the dark to it, an unhappy 16-year-old. Metal Box stands up. It stands for all time. \"],[22562,\"From 1999 to 2013, the American Wrestlers front man Gary McClure played guitar in the English shoegaze group Working for a Nuclear Free City. Despite being signed to the relatively small label Melodic Records (which just celebrated its 100th release in 2015), the band had big ideas and an even bigger sound—big enough, in fact, to land them a video game contract with Sony: they wrote “Silent Melody” for Infamous. Their dexterous, almost chameleon-like style stemmed from influences as disparate as Bill Evans and the Grateful Dead, and it managed to be psychedelic without sounding dated or hokey. Eventually, as band members began to focus more and more on solo projects, McClure took his omnivorous songwriting spirit elsewhere. He moved to St. Louis to marry Bridgette Imperial, and together they formed the core of American Wrestlers, whose self-titled 2015 debut was a similar grab-bag of musical influence. With Goodbye Terrible Youth, however, McClure seems to be turning his searchlight inward. The six-minute bedroom-rock epics from the 2015 album are absent here, as are the eight-track Tascam recorders they used to record it. The obvious shadow of other artists has faded, and what’s left here is an aging musician looking through himself to create something new out of the old. After all, the album’s main subject is described in its title: terrible youth. McClure isn’t shy about his memory. He doesn’t wince when he looks back. These are unabashedly personal and reflective songs, often filled with regret and loss, ugliness and shame. But, as McClure boldly sings on “Hello, Dear,” “Where goes youth, I go.”The album begins with “Vote Thatcher,” a death-obsessed track that speaks to a familiar theme for McClure: brutal policing. “I can always look to my son,” he sings, “to be stoned by policemen.” “Kelly,” the sixth track on 2015’s American Wrestlers, is also about police brutality, particularly the death of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man who was beaten into a coma by six police officers in 2011. It seems like a strange thing to begin an album about youth and memory with a song about modern policing, but there’s more to it. “My life for your throne,” McClure mourns on “Thatcher,” “I still can’t believe you died.” The words echo over a haunting synth melody. What is he bargaining for? Who is he bargaining with? We don’t get an answer. And as much as the album is about McClure’s own experience growing up, it’s also about the people who don’t live beyond youth. In this way, the music reflects both promise and tragedy in equal parts.Heavy guitar distortion—a staple in McClure’s work—colors over many of the songs on Terrible Youth. In “Give Up,” the album’s lead single, the constant buzz of rhythm guitar wins out over a catchy riff. “Amazing Grace,” a beautiful track about surrendering to happiness when the sun comes “bright across the rooftops,” bathes in a gentle hum, almost like sunshine itself. McClure’s use of distortion doesn’t evince ecstasy like it does for the Japandroids, nor does it mimic playfulness like it does for Youth Lagoon.  The distortion here is something else, something distressing. “Metal moans will multiply,” McClure sings on “Terrible Youth,” “we’re death in motion.” If the “metal moans” behind the distortion represent anything, it’s the discomfort of remembering where we’ve been, and as McClure suggests, where we’re going. What holds Terrible Youth back from becoming a really coherent, powerful statement is a kind of haphazardness in its arrangement. McClure doesn’t write choruses, he writes contrition, and sometimes this makes it difficult to take hold of any single resounding emotion in the music. Songs like “So Long” and “Blind Kids” rely on chord changes, but it’s rare for those changes, those shifts of feeling, to build toward anything greater.  And beyond casting an ‘80s sheen over the album, synth rhythms and melodies aren’t given any other direction or purpose — they rev the engine without propelling the car.   Although the scattered nature of some of the songs keeps any single narrative from taking shape, the album is a significant improvement for a band that’s still coming into its own, still, in other words, in its youth. When the heartache of memory gets to be too much, American Wrestlers are there to show us, as McClure puts it best, that “All that weight\\/It could be but it’s make believe\\/And when it stops it’s nothing.”\"],[22578,\"For the lead single of her second album, Tove Lo chose as inspiration one of the most-circulated and least-understood literary quotes of the past decade, the “Cool Girl” monologue from Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl: “Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.” People circulating this quote almost always leave out the fact that the woman delivering this soliloquy is a psychopath who will go on to rack up a body count. But why they circulate it is more telling: that in her misanthropy she’s elucidated something very real about relationships, and very bleak.Tove Lo knows a bit about bleakness and misunderstanding; she’s courted both from her first single. The bluntness of “Habits (Stay High)” ensured it’d cut through the crowd of anodyne rising pop stars but also ensured that for the next year Lo would field interviews about whether she actually lurked in sex clubs and picked up daddies on the playground. As a student of confessionalism, she knows audiences have an endless appetite for scandalous female writers, from Mary McCarthy to Cat Marnell to Fiona Apple to Britney Spears, and that they crave their honesty less than they do their imagined autobiographies, their self-destruction and bare flayed skin. As a student of pop, she knows that her industry parses women's vulnerability as empowerment, their pain as sexiness, their point as pop as usual. Lo certainly leaves herself open to misinterpretation—her Sticky Fingers-via-creepshot album art, her music’s endlessly quotable debauchery. Perhaps knowing this, she practically spells Lady Wood out: putting an explanatory interlude in the outro of “Imaginary Friend” (“I don’t know... I guess it’s kind of like a voice in my heart reminding me that there's nothing to fear”), all but defining “lady wood” on the title track, or addressing the audience on “Cool Girl”: “Now you can’t tell if I’m really ironic,” Lo sings, absolutely correctly.“Cool Girl” is equally a pop song, a delivery device for a sassy, stuttery chorus about being a cool girl. It's the line all smart music walks, and Lady Wood walks at album length. The album’s a showcase for Wolf Cousins, the Max Martin-affiliated songwriting collective that includes Lo and nearly a dozen others, including Swedish writer Ilya Salmanzadeh, Iranian producer Ali Payami and production duo the Struts. They’ve written about half the charts, but Lady Wood is as concentrated an outlet for their sound as you’ll find. But it’s equally a platform for Lo to argue, as she did on Queen of the Clouds, that the self-destructive affairs of a particular sort of woman are a subject worthy of four-part concept albums. Lady Wood is the first two parts: the high and the comedown, the party and the afterparty. The structural resemblance to the Weeknd’s EPs isn’t accidental. When Abel Tesfaye worked with the Scandinavian claque he became Lo’s direct colleague, and the debauched tableaux and nervous vocal tics of tracks like “Don’t Talk About It” and “Keep It Simple” sound almost tailor-written for him. The sound is basically the same, too: nocturnal, minor-key synthpop, less suited to dancing with tears in your eyes than waking up alone and disheveled the morning after. It’s the same sound the Wolves have worked for over a year, but in Tove as in Abel they’ve found an ideal collaborator, one who goes as dark as they do. For the most part, Lady Wood abandons the shock value of its predecessor; the title track and a couple nods to being “under the influence” are about as explicit as things get. But her ruminations and obsessions are the same: the fleeting freedom found in bad behavior; the compulsion of her women to tamp down their desires and their inability to do so; envy of the men in her misadventures, who have it easy. It’d be easy to play this as melodrama, but Lo sings most of the album without affect, so when she does emote, it counts for more: sneaking cutesy Betty Boop inflections into the backing vocals of “Cool Girl”'s chorus, belting into the void on the ballads, exclaiming “I’m gonna get hurt!” like it’s her deepest desire. That's on standout “True Disaster,” which begins as Marr-like feedback haze and turns into one of the year's best pop songs, a perfectly wrought instrument of self-laceration. (The effect’s somewhat ruined when the titular disaster reveals himself two songs later as mealy-voiced Joe Janiak, who barely sounds capable of manipulating a coffee machine, let alone a woman. This is why “True Disaster” should be a single.)That said, “True Disaster” isn't a perfect pop song. It suffers from Tove Lo’s primary weakness as a songwriter: her compulsion, at least once per track, to include a line that her Scandinavian colleagues might call “juicy” but that comes off more like a brand saying bae. At least on a track called “Lady Wood” you know what you're getting, but nothing about “True Disaster” prepares you for the line “I can't hide my feels.” Even the tracks free of such nonsense are so unrelentingly bleak and so professionally done that, at album length, they become interchangeable well-produced malaise. Yet when Lady Wood tries to go upbeat—as on “Imaginary Friend” and “WTF Love Is”—the resulting tracks are the weakest by far. The bridge to “Cool Girl” is designed to be the emotional core of the whole album, the moment Lo lets her guard down and reveals her true desires, but it just sounds like she’s emulating Sia. Proportionally, these are trivial complaints. Lady Wood is short, but Lo finds ample darkness to plumb. “Don’t Talk About It” recasts the girl squads so ubiquitous in pop culture as nihilistic cliques hazing each other into empty highs and dead-eyed selfies. “Flashes” does the same without the squad, Lo lamenting the effect on friends back home of so much mining her life for content: “When I fuck things up in front of camera flashes, what about you?” “Vibes” is deceptively chill, the supposedly lighthearted flirting of two parties with nothing between them but contempt. “What's your line, though?... Heard that before,” Lo teases, only to be negged down by Janiak. And “Keep It Simple”—befitting the title, just Lo and Cousins standout Payami—presents a scenario both hyper-specific and likely relatable: lying in bed with a rebound at some garbage hour of the night, flipping through an ex’s old sexts, feeling nothing. Payami’s synths land fast and loud like thunderclaps, and Lo pushes any impending connection or intimacy back into the dark. Then she pulls herself together for the drop, the cool girl once more.\"],[22414,\"You don’t come to one of Steve Hauschildt’s records expecting, or even hoping, to be surprised. The Cleveland electronic musician's consistency is one of his great strengths: His synthesizers ripple like a mountain stream at peak snowmelt, and his frictionless pulses represent only the finest qualities of electricity itself. They feel like dreams of a coal- and hydraulic-free future, when mammoth wind turbines and sparkling solar arrays offer the promise of a guilt-free grid.That’s not to say Hauschildt’s sounds or techniques are necessarily very original; he makes no attempt to disguise his debt to artists like Klaus Schulze, Edgar Froese, and Manuel Göttsching. But, much as his former band Emeralds did, he has succeeded in taking those influences and spinning them into a fusion that is his alone. Over the course of several albums for Kranky and a handful of CDR and cassette releases, he has channeled those spinning arpeggios into an unmistakable signature.Throughout his solo career, Hauschildt has signaled his disinterest in strictly repeating himself—thus the Vocoder and new wave experiments of Sequitur, and the occasional detour into ambient techno on Where All Is Fled. But it’s worth bearing in mind that Emeralds’ breakup, whatever its ultimate causes, was presaged by the radical shift in sound they took with their final album, 2012’s Just to Feel Anything. And what keeps many listeners coming back to Hauschildt’s records is precisely the promise that each album will sound practically interchangeable with the one that came before—just, perhaps, marginally better.On both of those counts, Strands succeeds, yet it also marks a shift in tone: At just eight tracks and 43 minutes long, it is noticeably more restrained. A few songs could have come from any of his earlier albums: “Same River Twice,” whose title goes to the heart of Hauschildt’s approach, unleashes a dizzying moiré of overlapping pulses—eighth notes, 16th notes, 32nd notes, all spinning like pinwheels whose tips are fixed with tinier pinwheels ad infinitum. But five tracks feature no arpeggios at all, which, given Hauschildt’s previous work, is a little like imagining a Four Tet record with no samples, or an Aphex Twin record with no drum machines.“Transience of Earthly Joys,” in which piano and pipe organ transmute into feedback-ripped synth squalls, has a quiet, blurry calm that's reminiscent of the most ambient moments on Cocteau Twins and Harold Budd’s The Moon and the Melodies. The rich, augmented chords and faintly detuned oscillator voices of “A False Seeming” and the slow, string-like passages of “Time We Have” also recall the The Moon and the Melodies, along with another 4AD album of a similar vintage: Michael Brook and Pieter Nooten’s 1987 album Sleeps With the Fishes, which framed melancholy pop melodies in velvety synthesizers and echoing guitar. In its slowest moments, Hauschildt’s album exudes the same sort of narcotic bliss. At points, it barely resists tipping into the maudlin, but that resistance, that willingness to inch right up to the edge of bathos without falling into it, is part of what makes it so captivating.It’s a bold move, slowing down like he has here. But by taking the emphasis off of rhythm, he allows us to focus instead on the texture of the sounds themselves. His patches are so physical—rasping, buzzing, peeling off like metal shavings—that you can imagine holding them in your hand. They feel like direct extensions of the silicon in the machines that produced them, like the transfiguration of sand into sound.\"],[22498,\"Over the course of Lambchop’s two decade-plus career, they have been remarkably consistent. Even with their various lineup shifts, there have never been any tumultuous breakups, no big reunions, no major controversies. Any of their 12 studio releases could reasonably be your favorite. But while each of their albums sound unmistakably like Lambchop, no two of them sound quite alike; from the bouncy alt-country of Thriller, to the stark lounge folk of Is a Woman, through the sweetly orchestrated ballads of their last album, 2012’s excellent Mr. M. As a frontman, Kurt Wagner–with his inimitable baritone, like an agoraphobic Bill Callahan–has also shifted and stretched in his own quiet way. Sometimes he’ll greet you with a pre-coffee grumble; other times, he’s singing in the shower with a wispy falsetto. Like any good leading man, Wagner redefines himself for the role he’s playing, but he never lets you forget that he’s in control.So while FLOTUS, the band’s Vocoder-drenched, largely electronic new album, might initially feel like a shock, the reinvention is not entirely unprecedented. Last year saw the release of The Diet, an album by Lambchop side project HeCTA– featuring Wagner, as well as drummer Scott Martin and multi-instrumentalist Ryan Norris– that found Wagner singing his characteristic melodies over dance beats and au-courant synths (“You shouldn’t have to change a thing, except your mind,” he sang in the album’s highlight). Those ideas come into full bloom throughout the nearly-70 minute FLOTUS, though it’s less tentative and more seamless, with even Wagner’s vocals sounding like an instrument in the mix (this is not merely Lambchopped and Screwed). Like Bon Iver on 22, A Million, Lambchop exist here as a modern Americana act refusing their genre’s assumed aesthetics. But unlike the post-Yeezus cacophony of 22, A Million, FLOTUS is as lush and gorgeous as any of Lambchop’s past work, sometimes floating by with the luxurious chill of hotel lobby music, but never losing its sense of direction.With the majority of the album eschewing traditional song structure, the most immediate way to listen to FLOTUS is as a bridge between its twin epics: the opening “In Care of 8675309” and its closer, “The Hustle.” In Lambchop’s lineage of long, slow-burning album openers, “8675309” is their longest and their slowest-burning. It also serves as a smooth gateway into the band’s new sound, with Wagner’s heavily effected vocals–like the church organ setting on a cheap keyboard with the speakers muffled–rising from tentative opening notes to full-blown crooning by the end, accompanying one of the album’s best melodies. Wagner has cited both Kendrick Lamar and Shabazz Palaces as inspirations for his new direction, but a more fitting reference here might be Future, whose use of Auto-Tune is less ornamental and more foundational to his very cadence and word choice. As such, “8675309” is not merely a great Lambchop song with a weird vocal effect; it’s a great Lambchop song because of the weird vocal effect. “The Hustle,” on the other hand, arrives at the end of the record devoid of any vocal effects. Hearing Wagner’s untreated voice by that point makes it sound even more powerful and vulnerable. “I don’t want to leave you ever,” he opens, his voice warbling and reverberating all on its own, “And that’s a long, long time.” Over the course of its jazzy, stuttering 18 minutes, the song slides between movements, like Destroyer’s similar tour-de-force “Bay of Pigs,” before closing with the faint sound of piano. “It was raining like a movie\\/And it was hard to look away,” Wagner sings, a fitting metaphor for how captivating and uncanny but wholly natural the song feels.While none of the other tracks on the album are as immediate as “8675309” or as stunning as “The Hustle,” they each reveal their charms on repeated listens. The ones that focus on simple, repeated phrases–like “You are very remarkable” in “NIV” or “Take it on the chin” in “Directions to the Can”–become catchy in an effortless way. The less vocal-focused songs function as opportunities to appreciate the other members of the band. Tony Crow’s piano in “Howe” is as lyrical as any of Wagner’s appearances, and Matt Swanson’s bass in “Old Masters” slithers with soulful charisma. Every part of the record speaks to the greater whole, from the album cover (a close-up shot of Wagner’s wife, Mary Mancini, the Chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party posing with Obama), to the title: both an acronym for “First Lady of the US” and, according to the liner notes, “For Love Often Turns Us Still,” a meditation on how simple things still render us speechless. “Given enough time, I can pretty much draw a correlation between any separate objects,” Wagner has said. The disparate pieces of this album play to that strength, unfolding like a long riddle.It’s to the band’s credit that FLOTUS exceeds its novelty. In a year when Springsteen, Bowie, and the creator of a hit Broadway musical have all cited Kendrick Lamar’s music as an inspiration, FLOTUS does not come entirely out of left field; it’s a solid, satisfying listen, devoid of context. Wagner’s lyrics are as cutting as ever (“See the flowers wilt\\/From the government they built\\/As the hammers wail\\/On a ship that hasn’t sailed”) and the band already sounds comfortable with their new sound, settling into a weightless groove that make you feel as if they’ve played this way forever. It’s one of Lambchop’s greatest strengths, that even when they’re overtly experimenting, they wear it as naturally as the garish pearls that have adorned their stage attire. “There’s that old saying about an artist having only one or two good ideas in his life and is doomed to repeat them,” Wagner recently said in an interview. “I reject that notion. I think I have maybe five.” What’s clear after listening to FLOTUS, is that he’s only getting started.\"],[22413,\"Roman Flügel has released hundreds of tracks over the roughly quarter-century since he began putting out records, and in them he has explored many permutations of four-on-the-floor dance music: hard techno, acid trance, willfully lunkheaded electro-house, lyrical deep house. The Frankfurt native doesn't tend to stay in any one place for too long. On his 2014 album Happiness Is Happening he delved into glinting synth-pop and Krautrock's motorik chug; earlier this year, his Verschiebung EP explored polyrhythmic drum sounds as dry and scratchy as strep throat.Even within the context of that panoply of styles, All the Right Noises stands out as something we haven't heard from him before. The moods and sounds may be recognizable from his recent work, much of which has tilted toward contemplative states; glinting synthesizer patches transmit a pensive air, and the analog drum machines maintain a kind of stone-faced calm. But this is the furthest that Flügel has strayed from the dancefloor, at least for such an extended stretch.It isn't strictly an ambient album. “Warm and Dewy” plows ahead at a quick-stepping 130 beats per minute, battered by tablas and brandishing hi-hats that couldn't be sharper if they'd come straight from the J.A. Henckels factory. (This, too, is new territory for Flügel: The drums sound a lot like he's been listening to Shackleton’s classic Skull Disco fare, in fact). But four-on-the-floor beats are an exception rather than the norm, and even when they appear, they make a beeline away from the functionalist dictates of contemporary dance music. Following the gorgeous, clear-eyed ambient opener, “Fantasy,” “The Mighty Suns” drops us into a curious kind of middle ground: It's fast-paced, but it feels half-speed; the pulse nods to dub, yet the bright keys and faintly naïve melodies echo Kraftwerk. It sweeps you up in colliding waves of contrapuntal melodies, a sensation at once both relaxing and slightly unsettling: You're never quite sure in which direction it will move next.Rhythmically, the album peaks early, just three tracks in, with the polyrhythmic lurch of “Dead Idols.” Triplets snap against 4\\/4 rhythms, and an off-kilter clunk pulls the groove into a strange, elliptical shape; the first dozen times you hear it, you can practically feel your brain straining to parse the timekeeping. Shackleton's influence is audible here, too, along with the doomy menace of an artist like Demdike Stare, with wraithlike voices ratcheting up the tension as minor-key bleeps sound an ominous alarm. The rest of the album tackles far more soothing sounds: “Nameless Lake” harnesses the chirps and chimes of Amber-period Autechre; the elegant, strutting “Dust” reimagines Jean-Michel Jarre as downbeat acid; and the melancholy “Planet Zorg” is sad-sack ambient house with a hint of shoegaze thrown into the mix, sparking memories of Superpitcher remixing M83.But the most satisfying material here may be the simplest. “Believers” offers the merest hint of kalimba plucks spun through delay and the occasional piano chord. Very little happens, and captivatingly so. The same goes for the closing song, which at first listen might sound like a new age spa soundtrack, complete with electronic crickets deep in the mix. Listen closely, though, and you can hear Flügel's playful spirit at work in the song's richly expressive piano and restless synthesizer improvisations. He effortlessly squeezes so many ideas into its barely-there, four-minute frame, it's easy to wish he'd settle in and record an entire album of such quietly masterful pastoral mood-setting.\"],[22572,\"As one-half of Single Minded Pros alongside Doc West, the Chicago-bred, now Brooklyn-based beatmaker DJ Rude One compiled a Rolodex of ’90s rap gods with his production work. The intro to new solo effort ONEderful lays out his credentials by assembling shout-outs from guys like Kool G Rap, DJ Premier, even DOOM (via a static-heavy audio message, as though recorded in his hidden underground lair). But on the record, Rude chooses not to call in old favors. Instead, he assembles a new list of contacts, all dedicated to the hard-boiled ethics—atmosphere heavy, hooks optional, Wu-Tang reigning over all—of NY orthodoxy. The lean, 10-track ONEderful is a grubby set of blood-in-your-mouth street raps, dusty record scratches and musty, subterranean beats. On “Mr. Goodbar,” Brooklyn-by-way-of-the-Ukraine emcee Your Old Droog flows with the blunted thump of the Kool Genius. Conway the Machine calls out all studio gangsters on the concrete-cold piano keys and tough drum loop of “Andre Drummond.” Elsewhere, “Street Scenes,” featuring Chicago’s Jeremiah Jae, is built on clinking piano keys that recall the Wu’s “C.R.E.A.M.” Roc Marciano gets two tracks—“Murder Paragraphs” and “Triple Black Benz”—because his rasping voice is suited for Rude One’s gritty sound. Almost everything here is sonically consistent, with rapper and producer perfectly in sync; no small thing when it comes to producer compilations that shuffle through guest spots this quickly.The best beat, though, is actually out of step with the rest of the tape. The Mr. Muthafuckin eXquire-featuring “Tyrannosaurs eX” is all swarming ’80s synths and Moroder-style pyrotechnics, hinting at a different direction. The only unequivocal disappointment is “Supreme Trunks.” Conway’s Griselda Gang sibling Westside Gunn has recently established himself as one of NYC’s real emerging talents, but he’s hampered here by a grating keyboard stab that’s impossible to navigate, even with his energetic flow.DJ Rude One succeeds, though, by keeping his focus narrow and his lens firmly fixed. ONEderful is short, snappy and completely disinterested with any kind of traditional song structure. It moves with beat-tape momentum, and has no concerns other than letting its rappers do whatever the hell they want. A low-key release, maybe, but if you just want to just listen to some stalwart rhymes over brass-knuckle beats, Rude One proves an excellent foil.\"],[22462,\"On the same freezing February day in 1968, Wendy Carlos, Suzanne Ciani, and John Mills-Cockell all stopped by Robert Moog's studio to acquire his latest prototype, the Moog Modular synthesizer IIP. And with it, all three trail-blazed new paths for electronic music. Carlos went on to bring the strange synthesized sound into public consciousness with the epochal Switched-On Bach. Ciani went on to use her Moog and Buchla synthesizers in commercials, creating unimaginable sounds that slyly infiltrated the public's subconscious.Mills-Cockell’s contribution to electronic music, though, was a bit harder to parse. That’s changed this year. The first person to have a Moog in Canada, Mills-Cockell used it to heighten the psychedelic weirdness of Intersystems, whose work was compiled earlier this year. A short-lived multimedia ensemble, Intersystems’ installations and be-ins melded abstract visuals, eerie spoken word and otherworldly electronics from Mills-Cockell in a manner that rivaled the sensory overload of Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable. (Mills-Cockell also provided synths for the likes of psych-pop outfit Kensington Market, Bruce Cockburn, and Anne Murray.) Now comes a look at Mills-Cockell's adventurous trio Syrinx, which pitted his Moog against the drums and hand percussion of Alan Wells and the electric saxophone of Doug Pringle. Syrinx released only two albums in the early ’70s before disbanding. And while RVNG’s wont is to plunder and cull unreleased tapes, so singular are these two studio albums that with RVNG's handsome 3xLP set, the label reissued them intact, with a third disc given to unreleased takes and a stunning live document of the trio performing with the Toronto Repertory Ensemble. All but unknown in the US, Syrinx carved out a niche for themselves in Canada, sharing bills with the likes of Miles Davis and Ravi Shankar, while the brief cha-cha whirligig of “Tillicum” became the opening theme for a CTV Network documentary program, “Here Come the Seventies,” embedding its curious mélange of brass and circuitry into viewers’ ears.If the small number of composers and academics who got their hands on the Moog synthesizer wound up defining the early electronic music cannon, even fewer of them integrated the unwieldy instrument in a band or pop music without being labeled a novelty act. Silver Apples and the United States of America might be Syrinx’s closest contemporaries, but there’s a nimbleness and grace to the group that gives the sense of the group dancing beyond the confines of genre. It’s there from their very first number, “Melina’s Torch,” which feels wistful rather than weird. While electronics during this era were often deployed to mimic psychedelic mind states at their most intense and immersive, Mills-Cockell’s use of them instead suggests the contemplative comedown. There’s gentleness and elegance to numbers like “Journey Tree” and “Chant for Your Dragon King” that make for some of the most disarming experimental music of the era.The buzzing sine waves snaking through the uptempo “Appaloosa-Pegasus” suggest that the band could also venture into stranger climes. By the time of 1971’s Long Lost Relatives, they had abandoned the pastoral airs of their debut for a more imposing sound. “Tumblers to the Vault” is an apt title, suggesting a precision and physical prowess you can hear in the songs: Mills-Cockell’s Moog is as luminescent as jumping jack firecrackers while Wells’ hand drums and shook bells do pinwheels around it, all of it capped by Pringle’s sax lines nailing perfect somersaults between the two.The better part of Tumblers is given over to three versions of “December Angel,” a nearly ten-minute journey that appears in studio version, demo and live rendition with an orchestra. Weird squalls introduce the studio version, Mills-Cockell getting his Moog to chime like a celeste. The demo version of the song, on piano, lays bare the melody at the heart of the trio’s music. But the live performance might be the most surprising, with space that allows for violins and bells to swell and sparkle in the firmament. Midway through, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Syrinx wasn't a groundbreaking group using the newfangled Moog to make mutant pop, but rather forward-thinking scholars of Debussy. Beyond being merely Switched On, Syrinx envisioned where electronic music would go decades later, being a pliant thing that at once eluded and embraced other genres, making them into a singular, impressionistic sound. \"],[22557,\"Denver’s Khemmis traffic in longform doom metal, letting their anger spread gradually rather than unleashing it all in one torrent. It’s an unlikely sound to gain wider attention, as it’s resistant to translation and often encourages the depression that’s consistent with its tempos. Where many of their peers double down on Master of Reality worship or tread into more psychedelic or progressive waters (as is the case with Pallbearer, their main contemporary), they elongate the time-worn dual guitar harmonies of Thin Lizzy and Judas Priest, working within a more traditional metal context. Hunted, their second record, sees them making strides in finding their sound, with leads as poignant as their accompanying vocal work.When your band’s vibe derives mainly from the melody, those leads better be solid, and Khemmis’ core, guitarists and vocalists Phil Pendergast and Ben Hutcherson, make the sorrow in their songs downright joyful. Opener “Above the Water” establishes this rule quickly, with jubilant leads that rival Iron Maiden’s sprightly guitar work. They’re not bogged down by Hunted’s overarching gloom; rather, they justify the songs’ weight, serving as a gliding bridge between lumbering cliffs. The ending of “Candlelight” shows how Pendergast and Hutcherson can be tricksters too, by bending what would be a showstopping riff and burying it in the murk. “Beyond the Door” even features a ZZ Top-esque boogie where they sound like Billy Gibbons wandering through a wasteland, the shuffle acting as a last-ditch flare for any sign of life. (Get a Texan in your band—drummer Zach Coleman, who’s also played in cult black metal duos Vasaeleth and Dagon—and that influence is bound to rub off somehow.) Pendergast’s somber war cry carries the music as much as his own guitar work. His pealing tone suggests mightiness, but what shines through is what a toll such power can take. “Three Gates” plays around with how death metal and doom influences combat each other. “Gates” is also a nod to the Peaceville Three—Anathema, My Dying Bride, and Paradise Lost—whose earlier works fused death metal vocals, doom pacing, and a bleak outlook. Khemmis have stripped the cobwebs off those bands’ more Gothic moments and revealed the rock ‘n’ roll heart lurking beneath, and “Gates” is a prime example of how their lack of varnish works in their favor.\"],[22485,\"One doesn't have to be a broken-hearted straight male (or even a Nobel Prize voter) to fall in love with Bob Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks, but it might help. Filled with open-ended and often gender-specific pronouns, the yous, hers, hes, shes, and theys remain unnamed on all but one of the 10 songs on the moody 1975 epic, each a glowing invitation for listeners to fill in the blanks with their own nearest available emotional devastations. Often referred to as Dylan’s “breakup album,” it’s likewise become just that for many listeners, both expressing and absorbing great aloneness. Dylan himself professed confusion about the album’s popularity. “It’s hard for me to relate to that,” he said the year Blood on the Tracks was released. “I mean, people enjoying that kind of pain.”But as plenty have pointed out in the wake of Dylan’s Nobel for Literature, his music is about far more than just his lyrics, and Blood on the Tracks is a prime example of just what that more constitutes. Beyond the emotional wreckage, Blood on the Tracks might be Dylan’s most welcoming LP, its music projecting an undeniable warmth. The disc-opening “Tangled Up in Blue” uncorks the feels via an experimental narrative that fights conventional linearity, but the reasons to keep listening are contained in the first 11 seconds of forward motion before Dylan’s voice enters. Only after that do lyrics even matter, and (on Blood on the Tracks, anyway) he is pretty fantastic at both.Blood on the Tracks is pleasing and complete enough to visit repeatedly, until the syllables become words, the words resolve into meanings, and all of it becomes internalized, a space accessible even without the presence of the album. Perhaps the least dated of Dylan’s recordings, there is a nakedness to everything. Untainted by the politics and cool of the ’60s or the gated drums and overdubbed productions of the ’80s, Blood on the Tracks hits with the same immediacy in the 21st century as it did in 1975.Just as much as Pink Floyd or any other mid-’70s LP-minded artist, Dylan uses the studio to create and sustain a mood on Blood on the Tracks, and this mood is what survives. Drawing from two sets of sessions and at least three configurations of not-fully-identified musicians to capture a singular batch of songs, the album is a full package of writing, performance, and atmosphere. Withdrawing an early version of the album on the eve of release, musicians from sessions in New York disappeared into the credit of “Eric Weissberg and Deliverance,” and musicians recorded later in Minneapolis received no credit at all. Though he received no separate title on the album itself, it is also the first album on which Dylan himself served as sole producer, assembling musicians on his own, sometimes to confusing effect. While staying within the parameters of folk-rock, Dylan finds a rich array of approaches, moving between the vivid brightness of “Tangled Up in Blue” and “You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,” the soft-voiced late-night guitar\\/bass duets of “Shelter From the Storm” and “Buckets of Rain,” and the pained autumnal crispness of “Idiot Wind.” “Nobody sings Dylan like Dylan” ran one of Columbia Records’ ’60s advertising campaigns, but by the early ’70s consumers were deluged with multiple generations of New Dylans, each expanding from territory that once belonged almost exclusively to Dylan, from Joni Mitchell to Bruce Springsteen, Leonard Cohen to Patti Smith. After a few years in the wilderness, when Dylan recorded for David Geffen’s Asylum Records (and Columbia released Dylan, scraping up unissued sessions without his consent), Blood on the Tracks might be seen as Dylan’s own assertion that nobody wrote Dylan like Dylan, either. For fans at the time, it was a revelation, both a few notches less cryptic than his ’60s surrealism, but no less mystical, folding in techniques of his old finger-pointin’ (“Idiot Wind”), blues-strummin’ (“Meet Me in the Morning”), vision-havin’ (“Shelter From the Storm”), and story-tellin’ (“Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts”) self, all while tapping into powerful new realms of vulnerability.As a writer, Dylan had been through about three lightly overlapping phases over the previous 15 years—young and Woody (1960-1963), young and visionary (1964-1968), and young and happy (1969-1973), and Blood on the Tracks built on them while promising something more. Officially retired and raising children during the early ’70s, Dylan had deliberately downshifted into a less complex lyric style beginning with 1969’s Nashville Skyline, in part hoping to shake some of the obsessive global audience he’d attracted. New Morning and other country-pop sessions from the period found Dylan playing with some of the brighter textures he would employ on Blood on the Tracks, but his reluctance to write in the symbolism-laden voice of his earliest years soon resulted in a period when he “more or less had amnesia,” as he later told an interviewer. Returning to active songwriting in 1973 and the road in 1974 with the Band for Planet Waves, many of his latest songs seemed to lack the all-seeing perspective of his earlier work.Dylan would say Blood on the Tracks was influenced by lecture classes he took with painter Norman Raeben in New York in early 1974. “You’ve got yesterday, today, and tomorrow all in the same room,” he said of the new lyric writing approach that resulted. Heard most vividly in the long-arc narratives of “Tangled Up in Blue” and “Simple Twist of Fate,” verses and lines present images like shuffled postcards connected by what Dylan referred to as a “code.” It is here that thinking of Blood on the Tracks as a “breakup album” becomes reductive, missing out on much of what the collection of songs has to offer, the “breakup” as much a concept as the bandshell concert loosely framing Sgt. Pepper’s. Just as much as relationships are about more than their breakups, breakup albums are about more than their relationships.Though the disintegration of Dylan’s marriage might easily be spotted in nearly every song on the album, there are also meditations on the ineffable passage of time (“Tangled Up in Blue”), a transitory love affair in the present tense (“You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go”) and media jackyldom and other bummers (“Idiot Wind”). For that matter, a full third of the LP’s second side is concerned with “Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts,” a nine-minute 16-verse ballad that bucks the album’s signature themes of time regained, implacable loves, and unnamed names. Though remaining convincingly jaunty throughout with a light melody that catches the details in forensic clarity, its drawn-out story is a chore to decipher. Unlike the ambient emotional narratives of the rest of the album, the linear ballad requires a full and present attention, a reminder of one of the ways that music consumption is different than reading. Reportedly once considered for a film adaptation, the screen may’ve suited its stage-directed characters better than folk-rock. Further separating it from the rest, the blood spilled on this particular track doesn’t seem to be Dylan’s own, detracting from the album’s bigger picture and only underscoring the unifying power of the other nine songs.Drawing on a range of songwriting tricks (including an open “E” tuning that assures that very few will play Dylan like Dylan, either), Blood on the Tracks emphasizes a feeling of raw expression. Singing live in the studio (with the exception of the overdubbed “Meet Me in the Morning”), Dylan placed his usual focus on capturing in-the-moment performances. And though his reputation for studio and onstage spontaneity is well-deserved, Blood on the Tracks also presents songs that he had spent almost all of 1974 writing and reworking. Personal, perhaps, the songs easily transcend their would-be biographies. If Dylan’s attitudes towards his partners sometimes stand out as patronizing—“You’re a Big Girl Now” acting as an equally infantilizing bookend to 1966’s “Just Like a Woman”—they reveal more about the nature of hurt than anything useful about the songwriter.One glimpse into the making of the album comes through the version that Dylan very nearly released, scrapping it at the last moment, after jackets and test pressings had already been made. Playing an advance copy at a family gathering in Minnesota in over the holidays, Dylan—at the behest of his brother—decided he wanted a brighter sound, less of a downer. Flexing his superstar muscle and anticipating Neil Young, Kanye West, and others, he had the album recalled, pulling together a band of local folkies in the days after Christmas 1974 to rerecord half of the songs. The New York acetate (most recently offered in 2015 for $12,000) is all late night atmospherics, mostly just Dylan and bassist Tony Brown, the sound of the former’s coat-buttons brushing against his guitar strings. Though tracks have come out via various box sets, bootlegs of the New York sessions—sourced warmly from the acetate—are every bit as magical as the final product, a classic all its own, minus a clunkier “Lily, Rosemary, the Jack of Hearts.” In Minneapolis, Dylan brightened up the sound (changing keys on “Tangled Up in Blue,” striking a lighter keynote) and toned down some of the crueler lyrics (especially on “If You See Her, Say Hello”). If atmosphere was lost (and it was, especially without the pedal steel-drenched “You’re A Big Girl Now”), then accessibility was gained. Charting at #1 on its January 1975 release, Blood on the Tracks is arguably the last Dylan album on which a majority of the songs became standards of their own, part of the invisible canon shared at coffee houses, college campuses, or anywhere bright-eyed young pickers might congregate. In that way, it is also maybe Dylan’s last album of originals to qualify as “folk music” in both senses of the phrase: the popular genre defined by the presence of idioms and acoustic instruments, but also the great shared body of songs with lives and language that exist apart from their studio recordings and original performers. With the Byrds and many others achieving their own hits with his tunes and Dylan himself often circulating unrecorded work via folk music zines and songwriting demos, this had long been the expected fate of Dylan's songs.Imagining Dylan as a simple songwriter, the template of Blood on the Tracks—sad boy with an acoustic guitar and a handful of chords—might seem basic, until one tries to replicate anything about it, or even just strum the songs at home. Blood on the Tracks lives alone in Dylan’s catalog, that open “E” tuning (which Dylan refused to explain to his musicians) often preventing the songs from sounding exactly right in the hands of others. It lives on in its own peculiar way. Dylan has seemed to keep “Tangled Up In Blue” in particular to himself, rewriting the song several times, both casually (playing fast and loose with the pronouns), and more formally, including a near-total rework released on 1984’s Real Live. One of the few older songs Dylan has performed consistently in recent years, even newer verses have emerged over the past half-decade. Nobody covers Dylan like Dylan either, apparently.Though the albums on either side of Blood on the Tracks both made it to #1 and contained hints of the same songwriting territory, via Planet Waves’ “Going, Going, Gone” and Desire’s “Sara,” especially, they were only just hints. Some of Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks persona remained visible via the two legs of the Rolling Thunder Revue, but the original open tuning never returned, and Dylan would soon bury his vulnerability, too. The surrealism would resurface in full force for 1978’s Street-Legal, but the musical appeal didn’t. It took another few decades for Dylan even to return to the warm string-band sound of Blood on the Tracks, coming closest on his two 21st century albums of standards, Shadows in the Night and Fallen Angels. For a restless musician, it was a combination of factors that only came together once, locking together to transmit themselves through the years.Even roughly 40 years later, Blood on the Tracks broadcasts hurt and longing so boldly it has become a stand-in, the type of shorthand a song licensor would deploy at the push of a button if it wasn’t so expensive and maybe too predictable. It manages a balance of old pain resolved and wounds so fresh they seem as if they might never heal, brutal personal assessment and doubt, unnecessary cruelties and real-time self-flagellation. While Blood on the Tracks can be a constant companion to listeners during periods of initial discovery, it (and Dylan’s whole catalog) has also become something to be lived with over a long period and put away for special occasions. Functioning like a literal album, the density of the passed time and pressed memories in “Tangled Up in Blue” grow richer with each passing year. As with the narratives of the songs themselves, Blood on the Tracks continues to absorb yesterday, today, and tomorrow, promising it can sustain new listeners as much as new meanings, should it ever have to be called back into service. \"],[22547,\"Joe Budden has defined himself as an intensely emotional tough guy who has never stopped putting everything out there, but the New Jersey rapper’s best music has frequently cut inward. Throughout his Mood Muzik mixtape-series-turned-brand, Budden has picked at and peeled away his depression, addiction, and the many embarrassments he’s collected as an eager public figure. When he’s down, he opens up. In many ways Budden is an under-acknowledged trailblazer of hip-hop’s 21st century relationship with the Internet, ahead of his time in living for and through the web as much as alongside it. He nurtured his online fans before it was an obvious play, earning and grooming a cult following of lyric-obsessed hip-hop heads, some of whom prize his legitimate emo leanings, and some who just love bars.On his new album, Rage & the Machine, Budden’s music is less moody but as densely lyrical as ever. His raps have long leaned on the preferred devices of the competitive lyricism he exemplifies: puns, metaphors, clever topicality. “I used to drive around the tunnel in a Lexus with a snub\\/Before Power 105 was sneaking breakfast in the club,” he raps on “Uncle Joe,” a track that plays on his preferred trope of bitter contempt for the current state of hip-hop.The record is produced almost entirely by the Providence beatmaker AraabMUZIK, a 27-year-old whose pyrotechnic pad-smashing earned him viral YouTube fame as an MPC whiz. AraabMUZIK, whose given name is Abraham Orellana, has been generously collaborative and experimental, producing for the Diplomats and many others in a meandering career. Unfortunately, Rage & the Machine skips over Orellana’s most interesting inclinations—forward-looking fusions of electronic, dance, and street hip-hop—in favor of his most traditional ones, an unfortunate fit for Budden’s reductionist New York rap nostalgia.AraabMUZIK isn’t the type to dwell on a beat, and has established a formula of programming drums that is both finicky and mechanical. On a song like “Flex,” a conspicuous lead single that features Fabolous and Tory Lanez, he piles drum sounds onto each other expertly before haphazardly triggering a sample atop. With a breathless, high-word-count approach to lyricism, Budden benefits from the boxed-in nature of AraabMUZIK percussion, which give him a wall to push against. “Forget” is one of the best bits of matchmaking, a short, verse-only ramble on a boom bap 2.0 beat that lets both artists play to their talents. “I Gotta Ask” is a committed Jay Z homage; instead of an Annie number, !llmind flips a Sondheim stage song into similarly whimsical territory. Budden adopts Jay’s cadence to run down his preferred list of boasts and persistent complaints. Elsewhere, some songs arrive a little late to the party in borrowed clothes. “I Wanna Know” samples a Manhattans loop which was also the thrust of a standout Madlib beat on Freddie Gibbs’ 2014 breakout album Pinata. Sample recycling might not be the faux pas it once was in hip-hop—Madlib himself wasn’t the first to pull this record—but AraabMUZIK’s simple chop and pitch-up make it feel like a blatant beatjack. On a separate song, a separate infraction: “Time for Work” has a hook sung by Emanny that he must have written while listening to Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em,” because the melody is all but the same. More generally, Budden has struggled with making catchy songs and this album carries a couple clunkers with gawky hooks. To the rapper’s credit, Rage & the Machine is one of his more accessible records, less emotionally insular than usual, but perhaps a little cold for that reason. It’s not a redesign as much as a measured refinement. There’s a fan service aspect to Budden’s music by now that hinges on his fixed audience. “What you expecting from me?\\/Why else you checking for me?,” the singer Jazzy wonders on a track called “By Law.” If you’re listening to a Joe Budden album in 2016, you probably already know what you’re in for. \"],[22537,\"In 2014, Kevin Drew of Broken Social Scene approached Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie about recording an album. Downie said he didn’t think he had any songs. “But,” he said, “I have been writing about Charlie.”“Charlie” is Chanie Wenjack, a boy who, in the 1960s, was separated from his family and placed in the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in Kenora, Ontario. His name was warped into the misnomer “Charlie” by his teachers. One day he escaped the school and tried to walk home. His family lived 400 miles away. He never made it. The album that Drew and Downie made, Secret Path, is, in Downie’s words, “an attempt to capture the feeling, somehow, of trying to get home.”The first residential schools appeared in Canada in the late 1800s, and the system survived until the mid-1990s; children were removed from their families and placed in distant boarding schools administered by local churches and funded by the federal government. The schools were developed to “take the Indian out of the child”; teachers forbid the students from speaking or writing in their native language and educated them exclusively in white culture and Christianity. The students suffered physical and sexual abuse; many died from disease, which spread recklessly through the schools. Others committed suicide. The Canadian government stopped recording the deaths of children in residential schools in 1920, and many of the original records have been lost or destroyed. A recent commission estimated that up to 6,000 children may have died while living in residential schools, and earlier this year a state of emergency was declared in the indigenous community of Attawapiskat after 11 people attempted suicide on the same day; one of the cited reasons for the suicide attempts is the lingering, cross-generational trauma of residential schools. Downie tells Chanie’s particular version of this story by developing its sense of place. The compositions on Secret Path feel more like haunted environments than songs; it sounds as if Downie, Drew, and the Stills’ Dave Hamelin—all of whom supply most of the instrumentation—are all wandering through these spaces with Chanie. (This quality might’ve been transferred to the recordings by Drew, whose albums with Broken Social Scene have such a strongly defined sense of place that listening to them feels like visiting individual cities.) The instruments, mostly acoustic guitar and piano, are recorded in such a way that they produce atmospheres out of minimal playing. Piano chords drone and occasionally sound as if they’d been reduced to their own echo, wrapping the songs in a kind of musical shadow. This is the most severe and spartan context that Downie’s sang in since his solo debut, 2001’s Coke Machine Glow, and his words for the most part land in the scenery as haunted, disconnected fragments. Downie, as a lyricist, is traditionally remarkable for his density. Unlike fellow Canadian poet Leonard Cohen, he is not particularly interested in space, and unlike fellow Canadian lyricist Joni Mitchell, his songs aren’t delivered by or assembled around characters. His work is rarely about himself, and in fact seems to flow from a composite perspective, a sensibility that shifts so often that it resists characterization or stability. He takes literature, history, and geography, and compresses them into living, shapeshifting jigsaw puzzles. A lyric from “Christmastime in Toronto,” from his 2003 solo album Battle of the Nudes: “With your dark epiphanies\\/Your true lines of smoke\\/Your glistening rails and streetcars all aglow\\/Always the wind and the persistent snow\\/Gets into your eyes and your mouth and every fold of your coat.” At least half of that line is from Chekhov, and the other half is a mundane image of winter in Toronto ascending into a realm of magic realism. On Secret Path, Downie’s words have a sudden respect for space; they never veer from Chanie’s story. In the first song, “The Stranger,” Downie resists projecting onto Chanie, and the lyric produces an ambiguity and anxiety that feels true to the theoretical feelings of a lost 12-year-old: “And what I’m feeling is anyone’s guess\\/What is in my head?\\/And what's in my chest?.” But Downie is also capable of reducing the narrative to a single heartbreaking detail, as in the title track, where Chanie seems to wrestle with the definition of the word “windbreaker” as he’s assaulted by wind and frozen rain (“Doesn’t do what they said it’d do\\/It’s just a jacket”).Downie’s more direct lyricism may also respond to how Secret Path itself a story of space—of the distance between Chanie and his family, of the yawning space between his footsteps as he walks over a seemingly infinite stretch of train tracks. The image of the train tracks is provided by artist Jeff Lemire, who illustrated a graphic novel around the album; Lemire wordlessly depicts Chanie’s life before and after escaping the residential school in elliptical, repeating images and rhythms: one Chanie and two other students on a swing set, just before they escape the school; one of a raven, which may or may not be Chanie’s hallucination, drifting in and out of the minimal, monochrome landscape, sometimes carrying a pair of articulated eyes in its beak; and one of Chanie’s father, who is a hallucination, and who materializes out of the only soft petals of color in the book. There’s an uncanny loneliness in Lemire’s pictures and in Downie’s words. “I can see my father’s face\\/Warming his feet by the stove,” Downie sings in “I Will Not Be Struck.” “We used to have each other\\/Now we only have ourselves.” He’s describing a kind of distance, a kind of space that can’t be filled or healed.In August of this year, the Tragically Hip played what is potentially their final show, which took place in their hometown of Kingston, Ontario. Downie had been diagnosed a few months earlier with glioblastoma multiforme, a terminal brain tumor characterized by necrotizing tissue forming around aggressive, undifferentiated cells, and which in x-rays appears as a shadow swimming through fluorescent regions of the brain. Downie’s memory was compromised; he remembered his lyrics through teleprompters that were arranged around the stage. In between songs, with 11.7 million Canadians watching the concert through the CBC broadcast and its attendant stream, he started to improvise; Downie identified Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the audience, and admonished him to start repairing Canada’s relationship with its indigenous population. “It’s going to take us 100 years to figure out what the hell went on up there,” Downie said. “But it isn’t cool and everybody knows that. It's really, really bad, but we're going to figure it out. You're going to figure it out.\\\\\" Secret Path, it seems, is Downie’s own way of figuring it out.\"],[22441,\"New Zealand guitarist Roy Montgomery has been involved with so much vital music that it’s hard to believe he’s spent most of his life not making any at all. In the early 1980s he was part of foundational Flying Nun band the Pin Group, then went silent for about a decade. He shifted into overdrive in the ’90s with free-rock outfit Dadamah, guitar duo Dissolve, and a string of excellent solo albums. The last of those, Silver Wheel of Prayer, came out in 2001, and since then he’s been quiet again, save for a few collaborations and an imaginary soundtrack.For anyone still under the spell of Montgomery’s mesmerizing ’90s work, there’s a lot of lost time to make up for, and apparently he thinks so, too. Motivated by some serious life events—including serving as volunteer firefighter during the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, and losing his friend and Flying Nun colleague Peter Gutteridge—Montgomery decided to get playing again while he still could. As he told The Wire, he vowed to “stop taking for granted always being able to return casually to composition and recording.” There’s certainly nothing casual about R M H Q, whose title stands for Roy Montgomery’s Headquarters. Montgomery has exploded his own creative floodgates to produce nearly three hours of music, available as four CDs in a set, or four LPs released individually. Each disc has its own title, lasts about 44 minutes, and works well as a stand-alone album. But R M H Q is especially compelling when you take it all together, or even just skip around from track to track. Montgomery’s self-made approach to writing and playing becomes deeper the more ways you hear it, and he varies that style throughout 30 pieces while always sounding like himself.Montgomery’s musical self is most tangible on the first disc, R: Tropic of Anodyne, the only one he sings on. His chillingly low voice has a somnambulant quality, as if he’s walking stoically through his own subconscious. Add his patient, slow-burning guitar, and these first eight songs become like a shadowy dream, the kind where figures are hard to make out and events feel mildly surreal. There’s naturally some darkness to R: Tropic of Anodyne—Montgomery seems to be working through some issues—but it’s a hypnotic darkness, and often a cathartic one, especially when he lets loose on guitar. There’s some wry humor here, too: take “You Always Get What You Deserve,” a wizened variation on the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” that makes accepting fate sound pretty cleansing.R: Tropic of Anodyne is RMHQ’s strongest chapter, with the most consistent, compelling tone. As if to prove his music isn’t always so downbeat, Montgomery spends the rest of R M H Q exploring a wider range of timbres. Through three albums of instrumentals—mostly centered on guitars, with some drum machine accompaniment—he sounds alternately eager, inquisitive, reflective, world-weary, and optimistic. In some spots he’s even giddy: on the second disc, M: Darkmotif Dancehall, he spends six minutes in “Six Guitar Salute to Peter Gutteridge” riding a bouncy, beatific wave. It’s a pretty positive album marked by rising tones and soaring crescendoes—classic post-rock from a guy who helped create that genre, whether or not he intended to.On R M H Q’s final two discs, Montgomery seems most concerned with testing out guitar styles, mixing weighty strumming, gradual string massaging, twangy extended chords, and a wealth of reverberant effects. Most of his playing throughout the set has a ringing, chorus-y hue that makes it immediately layered and atmospheric. That effect dragged down his last record, 2012’s Music from the Film Hey Badfinger, but because his playing on R M H Q is subtler and more varied, it’s now more a signature than an impediment. Often, it strikes a mood that enhances the emotions in Montgomery’s songcraft.As a result, your own mood may determine which parts of R M H Q hit hardest. I’m partial to the times Montgomery plays with abandon, as on “Riding” (from disc four, Q: Transient Global Amnesia). He piles chords until they cascade like a waterfall. But his more subdued moments—see the dusty, moonlit “And Later We Looked Up at the Stars,” on disc three, H: Bender—are just as gripping. And any mood will likely be affected by the set’s denouement, the 20-minute “Weathering Mortality.” Montgomery confronts his own expiration date, and his response—glorious chords that rage against dying light—typifies the life-affirming drive of R M H Q.\"],[22517,\"Despite the decades that have passed since porn moved from cinema backrooms to the internet, the phrase “porn soundtrack” still conjures raunchy funk guitars and that “bom chicka wah wah” sound. In the ’70s, the porn movie genre was still taking shape, while box office successes like Behind the Green Door and Deep Throat provided a template focused on male pleasure first and foremost. Working within the industry and yet pushing for more positive depictions of female sexuality, the late Candice Vadalla moved from being in front of the camera to behind it, a pioneer in feminist filmmaking. “Women were curious and wanted to see if there were some sexy movies they could enjoy with their partner, and there was nothing out there for that,” she once said of her own foray into directing blue movies.With her interest in body- and sex-positive activism, it makes sense that Royalle—who would adopt the stage name Candida Royalle—found a kindred spirit in Patrick Cowley. Having left the East Coast, both were 20-something transplants living in the sexually-unshackled playland of post-’60s San Francisco. In the early ’70s, Cowley provided soundtracks for Royalle’s street theater work with the Angels of Light (a spinoff of legendary troupe the Cockettes) as well as her performance projects, Warped Floors and White Trash Boom Boom.The Candida Cosmica EP is a fascinating, too-brief compilation of Cowley and Royalle’s recordings spanning ’73 to ’75. Predating Royalle’s own porn career, it shows where female sexuality and gay pornography, which is to say feminism and disco, briefly inhabited a shared space. (Some dates are hazy, but Cosmica may be contemporaneous with Cowley’s own gay porn soundtracks.) A decade before Cowley ushered in the Hi-NRG sound and scored a 1982 chart hit with Sylvester’s “Do Ya Wanna Funk,” Royalle was his early champion, occasional lover, and muse. The exploratory relationship between the two friends informs the slowly unspooling synth excursions of the five tracks here.Still a student at City College of San Francisco then, Cowley playfully repurposed equipment like the Serge modular synthesizer and Arp 2600 to electronically recreate Eden, using the primitive patches and filters to suggest gurgling streams and gentle air. Royalle occasionally lends her purrs and sighs, giving the synth-scapes a sense of beauty and wooziness. Only on the sultry closing “Tomato Song” does Royalle sing a proper song. She primarily provides an array of mewls, exhales, and murmurs that—through the lens of her subsequent career—scan now as libidinal. There’s a playfulness to her appearance on the title track, which Cowley then experiments with, converting Royalle into all manner of bird chirps, amphibian blips, wind howls, and the like. The track meanders, but delights, as Cowley’s electronics slyly turn Royalle into river, wind, woods, and then back to a nymph.“Elementals” is noisier, with Cowley evoking his early electronic forbearers. Its erratic blips and buried snatches of movie dialogue are reminiscent of Vladimir Ussachevsky, Luciano Berio, and Morton Subotnick, as Cowley sorts through just how to make electronics and the human voice work together. “Tantum Ergo,” meanwhile, is underwater electronic abstraction that brings to mind Jürgen Müller’s Science of the Sea. The nearly 12-minute “Shimmering (Where Am I?)” is the cosmic Quaalude at the center of it all, as Royalle harmonizes with Cowley’s undulating sinewaves, wondering aloud where she is. This parallels the sensuous strangeness of the Dark Entries label’s previously unearthed Cowley offerings. As “Shimmering” evolves, a tingling sensation feels at first physical, then mental, before the notion of a binary fades. Perhaps not as crucial as previous Cowley discoveries, Cosmica nevertheless intrigues, as Cowley uses his electronics to transform Royalle from flesh to a goddess, her every whisper echoing as if from some other dimension.\"],[22523,\"Roughly forty percent of the Hampton, Va., singer and rapper D.R.A.M.’s appeal is that he seems like just a really happy guy. His happiness is palpable, indestructible, communicable. His breakout hit was about the cha-cha, for god’s sake, a dance so winningly goofy in name and act that even 6-year-olds know to giggle at it. The chorus was about how he liked to cha-cha, and it was clear from the way he sang it that he meant it, goddamn it.After Beyoncé Instagrammed herself dancing to it, “Cha Cha” became the viral novelty hit that remained a hit after both the “viral” and the “novelty” wore off. D.R.A.M. quickly proved that he was going to stick around, pumping out a steady stream of joyful, heartfelt, and ever-so-slightly silly songs that treat rap and R&B like a big bubblebath. He has the broad, inspirational corniness of a star camp counselor, the kind of relentless motivational charmer who could coerce a roomful of older kids who should know better to get up and dance the chicken.Rap in 2016 is having a dizzy moment, in stark contrast with (or perhaps relief to) the sobering and dark times. Gentle positivity is suddenly a virtue, or an armor, and you can see it in music from new kids like Lil Yachty, who floats and gurgles amongst pink puffy clouds of beats like Kirby in his Dream Land, to Fetty Wap belting drunk-uncle love songs on Hot 97, to Chance, counting his blessings and bringing a lifetime’s worth of church services into the booth with him. D.R.A.M. doesn’t really have new ideas to pitch into this ball pit, but on his full-length debut Big Baby D.R.A.M., he reminds us that new ideas aren’t the whole game. The key to D.R.A.M. is his generosity, evident in his personality and his voice, a huge barrel-chested warble that lands somewhere in between iLoveMakonnen and Biz Markie. There is something sly in that voice, a sense that he is purposefully singing with just a little less certainty than he needs to, just to keep things relatable and allow you to belt along.Consider the first chorus of the first song: “I had to tell myself to go and get it myself,” he sings in a burly tone, and his vibrato wobbles a bit, like someone losing control of bike handlebars and steering towards a ditch. But then he comes in behind himself, stacking rich, flawless, three-part harmony, the top line a laser-cut falsetto, and you are gently reminded: He is actually a powerhouse. His best songs often hinge on concepts that could easily work as lame Lonely Planet-style parodies. Like the silk-sheets, window-steaming, bedroom-ready quiet storm ballad “WiFi,” for example, in which the male suitor gently croons “Do you got wifi? Cause I really wanna show you somethin’\\/But my phone is fuckin’ up” and the woman responds “Do you like my feng shui in my living room?”Yes, the song is funny, but it hits all sorts of other notes, too—“Put your phone down, please don't check it” pleads the woman, who just so happens to be Erykah Badu, an artist who made an entire whimsical and philosophical riff out of a mixtape full of songs about phones just last year. The tremble in her voice is not joking, and neither is the music, which is yearning and erotic and frank. D.R.A.M. has indicated that Hot Buttered Soul was a guiding light for him while recording, and Big Baby D.R.A.M. is full of evidence that he has learned real lessons from this study. He manages the same balancing act on “Cute,” a song that could be insufferably cloying if someone else were pushing it too hard—the chorus is, after all, “I think you’re cute\\/Oh yes, I do” repeated in a pinched falsetto, and it also features the line “I choose you like a Pokémon.” But specificity rescues it: He admits “one thing ‘bout me, I am a foodie,” and describes the exact moment and location he first saw her Instagram.  The song isn’t funny—it’s giddy, and few human emotions are worth treating as seriously. Great comedians slip the dead-serious stuff into the middle of their routines, and D.R.A.M. sneaks in some confessions amidst all of this crowd-pleasing. He even kinda\\/maybe\\/sorta takes a shot at Drake, who jacked the beat of “Cha Cha” and attached it to his world-conquering “Hotline Bling.” “I was hemorrhaging in the red and I could not afford it\\/N*ggas tried to appropriate me, I could not go for it\\/I’m taking mine, I’m claiming mine, bitch I go Narco for it,” he bellows on the Young Thug-featuring “Misunderstood,” one of the only minor-key songs on the album. Even on his surprise Top–40 charting hit  “Broccoli,” D.R.A.M. makes sure to note that he’s “at the restaurant with that ‘why you gotta stare?’ face,” implying that he’s aware you might have a reason to stare at him, and that he might not like the reason. It’s a barest hint of vulnerability, but it deepens the surrounding joy.Some of the interludes on Big Baby D.R.A.M. sound like they originated in some distracted shower-singing moment and didn’t evolve from that point—“In a Minute\\/In House” gently wastes nearly six minutes of your time as he coos in your ear, and “Change My #” is similarly directionless. As an end-to-end album, it can grow tiring; as delightful as, say, “Cash Machine”’s flip of Ray Charles’ “Hallelujah I Love Her So” is, sometimes you just need a breather.But D.R.A.M., one eye forever on the shot clock on his 15 minutes, leaves hints that he has yet another act planned; the sultry and low-key “Monticello Ave” retools some classic ’90s R&B grooves while he sits back, rapping in the pocket about the peculiarities and frustrations of his not-quite-star life and pining for someone. “I’m still mad at you for the shit you did, but not that mad, so just come to where I’m is,” he pleads. It’s poignant and small-scale and intimate, and about a million miles away from “Cha Cha.” Maybe one day we will no longer even remember that is where he started. \"],[22551,\"Since their acclaimed debut, 2003’s Lesser Matters, Sweden’s the Radio Dept. have been known for their defiantly lo-fi brand of dream-pop, favoring scratchy, ear-numbing guitars and tinny Casio beats over the lusher sounds of their peers. This became a calling card, something that set them apart. Apart from a career-spanning compilation (2011’s essential Passive Aggressive: Singles 2002-2010) and a smattering of single releases last year, Running Out of Love is the Radio Dept.’s first album of new material since 2010’s stellar Clinging to a Scheme, and while many would have been perfectly content with a total carbon copy of their greatest achievements, what makes this record so refreshing is its unabashed ambition, the sound of a band rejecting indie-darling complacency for riskier, more mature territory. And the gamble more than pays off. The band meant it as a protest record, a bold statement, a document of their fear of an ever-encroaching dystopia. “Sloboda Narodu,” the record’s opener, means “Freedom to the People” in Serbo-Croatian, a reference to a populist slogan coined during the Yuglosav anti-Axis resistance of World War II. Far from your typical twee fare of doe-eyed romance and bedroom dancing, “Sloboda Narodu” sets the stage for a full-blown political manifesto. “Don’t ask for patience\\/’Cause we just don't have the time\\/Freedom now,” sings frontman Johan Duncansson, his vocals as blissed-out and buried in the mix as ever. Musically, the track takes its cue from that sweet spot in ’90s Britpop that itself was aping ’60s psychedelia, with fuzzy guitars climbing over bongos. However from there, Running Out of Love hopscotches from genre to genre at breakneck speed. “Swedish Guns” (a meditation on Sweden’s little-known international arms industry) has the woozy dancefloor tilt of early Saint Etienne, while “We Got Game” (addressing police brutality) sounds like a backmasked, distorted version of Inner City’s Detroit house anthem “Good Life.”  This is far from the first time the band have dallied with electronic music, but unlike, for example, their synth-heavy second album Pet Grief, this feels more like a marriage  than a one-off; it’s as if Belle and Sebastian had decided to write an entire album of their polarizing 1996 song “Electronic Renaissance.” “Committed to the Cause” sounds like Happy Mondays by way of Prefab Sprout’s dandy sophistication, and the six-minute-long “Teach Me to Forget” even flirts with EDM, a broke-down version of a Top 40 banger. The multiple twists and turns here gradually unlock a completely new world orbiting their already adored universe, a daring feat for a beloved cult band. It might take a little longer for it to sink in with fans, but given enough time, the album  portrays them in a completely new light, both politically and musically adventurous. \"],[22568,\"Brian Piñeyro is part of a bustling New York club music demimonde that includes similarly leftfield-inclined producers such as Anthony Naples, Huerco S., and Patricia. But the Queens-based beatmaker is also verging on a mini-scene all by himself. DJ Wey, DJ Python, DJ Xanax, and now Luis—for a relatively green musician, Piñeyro has run up more than his share of pseudonyms, a tactic that seems part about minimizing awkward questions of identity, and partly about enjoying the freedom that comes from being a little slippery.Dreamt Takes, his debut 12-inch as Luis, bears traces of what has come before—hazy-eyed synths, brittle hardware drums, a slight wonkiness of rhythm—while adding additional hazy atmospherics, a sort of cotton-wool fuzziness that surrounds and permeates everything. If these tracks have a historical antecedent, it’s that early ’90s branching of the hardcore continuum that spawned Warp’s Artificial Intelligence compilations, which saw then-green names like Autechre, Speedy J, and Polygon Window crossbreed hardcore and rave with the introspective head music of Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd. Opener “HV’s Sequence” employs the same building blocks as pretty much any given early ’90s hardcore 12”—rattling breakbeats, clipped vocal samples, shuddering bass—but is unlikely to burn up the dance floor, instead aiming for blissful reverie. “Talk Me Down,” meanwhile, slices jungle snares into slim fillets and interlaces them with shimmering 8-bit effects; so pared back are its rhythms that you’re drawn to fill in the gaps yourself, although Piñeyro occasionally pitches in a flurry of drill‘n’bass beats to gesture in the right direction.Dreamt Takes is a reminder that it wasn’t its much-vaunted “intelligence” that made IDM distinct from the club scenes it span off, but mood and melody. “Shea’s World” suggests that Piñeyro hasn’t yet totally perfected the latter, its cycling of the same motif getting stale around the fifth minute. But the closing “Kirgaly” strikes the right balance between cranky deconstruction and melodic prettiness, a gem of misty-morning acid that’s throwing in neat twists and turns right to close. Whether Dreamt Takes is Piñeyro inching closer to a signature sound or just off another diversion isn’t clear, but for now his elusiveness is endearing. \"],[22483,\"Not long after the release of Blackstar, saxophonist Donny McCaslin’s jazz group became internationally famous as the collective that had helped David Bowie create his last triumph in the studio. The flexibility of McCaslin’s playing—as well as that of bassist Tim Lefebvre, drummer Mark Guiliana, and keyboardist Jason Lindner—allowed tracks like “Lazarus” to juggle a variety of moods and textures, without ever straying too far from the underlying motifs. In the aftermath of Bowie’s death, the band gave interviews about Bowie’s working methods, and also bade him farewell with a set at New York’s fabled Village Vanguard club. That same feeling of tribute anchors this band’s latest studio recording. Aside from playing two Bowie tunes, the set also includes a pair of covers of other electronic acts. Appropriately, the overall sound of Beyond Now leans more heavily into pop sonics than McCaslin’s previous recording with these same players.It’s an understandable move, though not always a successful one. The first Bowie cover, “A Small Plot of Land,” takes a jazz-tinged track from Bowie’s underrated album Outside, and updates it via the fusion sound found on Blackstar. It’s an able retrofitting of the tune. And guest-vocalist Jeff Taylor does yeoman’s work with the thankless task of standing in for Bowie. Still, not much new is discovered during this approach, and the rendition never moves beyond sounding like the work of a highly skilled cover band. Likewise, interpretations of Deadmau5’s “Coelacanth 1” and Mutemath’s “Remain” sound less like full-throated performances than atmospheric reminders that this is a group with pop crossover potential.This band’s range is better demonstrated during investigations of McCaslin’s own compositions. His “Bright Abyss” inspires the ensemble’s best collective performance on the album. As the piece moves from a low-key, druggy opening to McCaslin’s bracing tenor saxophone solo, Guiliana’s beat-division skills gradually raise the level of intensity. “Faceplant” has a barnstorming, punk-like energy that shows off several of Lindner’s most imaginative keyboard effects. And the bandleader has lots of room to roam during “Shake Loose” and the title track—moving with dexterity between fluid, fast figures and slurred-sounding passages that contain the occasional bit of multiphonic harshness. Overall, the half of Beyond Now that focuses on McCaslin’s original material fares far better, and should be sought out by anyone who wants another experience of the invention heard on Blackstar. Together with an effective, emotional reimagining of “Warszawa,” this portion of the album works as a welcome reminder of what they brought to Bowie’s final studio album: Not a facility for impersonating pop formats that were already well established, but rather the ability to create memorable, fresh forms.\"],[22567,\"In the last year of his life, David Bowie completed a pair of linked projects: his remarkable final album, Blackstar, and a curious jukebox musical for which he wrote a few new songs, Lazarus. Bowie, the most theater-minded of rock stars, had had ambitions to mount a stage musical for a long time; Diamond Dogs, in fact, had evolved from a scrapped musical based on George Orwell’s 1984. Lazarus, co-written with Enda Walsh, also has a literary source: it’s a sequel to The Man Who Fell to Earth. Officially, to be more specific, it’s a sequel to the Walter Tevis novel that was the basis for the 1976 film in which Bowie starred, with Michael C. Hall (of “Dexter” fame) playing his role, the alien Thomas Newton.Bowie recorded the three new Lazarus songs during the Blackstar sessions with saxophonist Donny McCaslin and his group, but only “Lazarus” itself actually appeared on Blackstar; a second disc with all three recordings has been appended to the soundtrack album. The show’s cast recorded the first disc on January 11 of this year, immediately after they’d learned of Bowie’s death, and the solemnity of the moment mutes the hypnotic delight of his songs. (Near the end, we hear forty seconds of his original recording of “Sound and Vision,” and it’s as if a conference room’s ceiling has momentarily peeled back to reveal the sky.)The central problem is that Lazarus is billed as an original cast recording, and it’s kind of not; it’s impossible to hear these “actorly” renditions of “Changes” and “It’s No Game” and “Love Is Lost” and so on without thinking of the cracked actor who defined them, and whose phrasing these performers ape at almost every turn. To put it more plainly: there is no song in Lazarus of which Bowie did not record a better version. And, despite some nicely considered arrangements (“The Man Who Sold the World” takes after Bowie’s mid-1990s reworking), a lot of these songs weren’t actually built for the stage: when Sophie Anne Caruso sings “Life on Mars?” as a scenery-chewing torch song, it’s suddenly clear how much of its power came from Bowie’s arch detachment. As translations of Bowie’s musical aesthetic to theater go, Lazarus lags far behind Hedwig and the Angry Inch—in which Hall also starred for a while.The three previously unheard Bowie recordings on the second disc, a bit under twelve minutes of music in all, are of a piece with the Blackstar material, if not as audacious or as polished as “Blackstar” or “Lazarus” or “Sue.” “When I Met You” is the jewel-in-the-rough of the bunch—Bowie’s backing vocals body-checking his warbling lead out of the way, the band a little out of tune and too into stomping out the rhythm to care. The “Lazarus” performance, whose guitar riff eventually just turns into “Purple Haze,” is the strongest thing on the cast album, possibly because Bowie’s own performance wasn't casting such a long shadow.Unsurprisingly, the newly released songs are full of intimations of mortality—but it’s also too easy to listen for farewells and forget that they were written for dramatic personae, by a songwriter who adored masks. “Killing a Little Time,” whose shuddering groove recalls the double-time tricks of Bowie’s mid-’90s records, includes a refrain of “I’m falling, man\\/I’m choking, man\\/I’m fading, man.” But the line that Bowie clearly relishes growling is “I’ve got a handful of songs to sing\\/To sting your soul\\/To fuck you over”—which would work just as well on somebody’s first record.So is this it for Bowie’s music? Nah, there's still more in the vaults: there were several more songs recorded at the Blackstar sessions, and according to producer Tony Visconti, Bowie recorded demos for another five songs shortly before his death. This isn’t his grand final statement (that was Blackstar), it’s a cool little postscript tagged onto an earnest, unthrilling tribute.\"],[22549,\"There’s always been a bemusing disconnect between David Crosby’s art and persona. On record, he often sounds suspended in a haze, caught between folky introspection and steely defiance, but he can come across as cantankerous crank. Recently, he’s been apt to vent his spleen on Twitter, where he maintains one of the best celebrity feeds going, and also in candid interviews where he doesn't hide that he’s feuding with former bandmate Neil Young and is so financially strapped that he’s had to sell his schooner and that he considers purchasing a Tesla an indulgence. All this turbulence would suggest that Lighthouse, his 2016 record, might be something of a tortured affair, but that’s not the case. Working with Michael League, the leader of the Brooklyn-based jazzy jam outfit Snarky Puppy—an outfit he’s been praising in public since 2014—Crosby abandons the slick professionalism that informed Croz, the 2014 album that saw him reviving his solo career after a 20-year hiatus. This is the first time he’s ever followed an album so quickly—previously, the fastest turnaround was four years, when 1993’s Thousand Roads followed 1989’s Oh Yes I Can—which underscores that Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young now belongs to the history books and Crosby has no reason to pursue any path other than his own.League decided to use Crosby’s 1971 solo debut If I Could Only Remember My Name as a touchstone, but Lighthouse is by no means a re-creation of past glories. First of all, League dispensed with any hints of elaborate production—there is no percussion, no electric guitars—and yet these hushed acoustic numbers can read as jazz: there’s an elastic sense of time and no adherence to strict strong structure. Lighthouse does share some qualities with If I Could Only Remember My Name, particularly in its expansive and lonely mood. But where the 1971 album seemed to ride a melancholy undercurrent, there’s a certain sense of reassurance to Lighthouse. Older, maybe wiser, Crosby is certainly gentler, letting his songs unfold according to no real sense of time. That’s the clearest sign of League’s influence: he encourages Crosby to indulge in his eccentricities.Usually, this manifests in songs that don’t follow strict contours. Certainly, verses flow into choruses and there are distinct melodies that provide a path to follow, but the lack of percussion gives the nine songs on Lighthouse a dreamlike feel; it seems as if the songs are unfurling as they’re imagined. Pro that he is, Crosby isn’t free-associating: Each of the songs is carefully constructed, the seams between the verses and choruses apparent upon close listening, as is the understated protest of “Somebody Other Than You” and “Look in Their Eyes.” Nevertheless, the pleasure of Lighthouse is that it’s best appreciated as mood music: with its buoyant acoustic guitars and murmured harmonies, it casts a light spell. \"],[22545,\"At 25, Joanna “JoJo” Levesque is already something of a veteran. In 2004, she became the youngest artist to hit No. 1 on the Billboard pop songs chart with “Leave (Get Out),” released when she was just 13. Its girl power ethos and catchy hook delivered by a precocious teen star aligned into a perfect pop moment. “Leave (Get Out)” was an emblem of the TRL era—and, ostensibly, the launchpad from which JoJo’s career would blast into the stratosphere.Some of this momentum carried over to her sophomore effort, The High Road, in 2006, featuring the excellent young love anthem “Too Little Too Late.” Then, in a turn of events that even the most experienced musician would dread, a legal dispute with her label halted any of her commercial ambitions. The battle essentially held her career hostage for the better part of 10 years. Now that the smoke has cleared, JoJo’s back with a new label in her corner, a decade of gritty industry experience behind her, and her third full-length album.Mad Love. provides some indication of the path JoJo might have taken if her career had rolled along uninterrupted. The EDM-leaning beats favored by today’s biggest pop stars, her contemporaries in terms of age if not necessarily longevity, are prevalent. The low, pulsating synths of bonus track “Good Thing.” build up to a drop on the chorus, and lead singles “Fuck Apologies.” and “F.A.B.” are obvious ploys for radio rotation. The former comes complete with a tame Wiz Khalifa verse, while the latter boasts an always welcome contribution from Remy Ma.From a different artist, these songs might sound like pre-packaged attempts to jump on the same bandwagon that she decries in “F.A.B.” In JoJo’s case, they play out as sincere progressions, bolstered by her vocal talent and honest approach to storytelling (she has songwriting credits on every track). There’s enough compelling singing across Mad Love. to hold interest, even if your tolerance for dance-pop wears thin.Rhythmically, JoJo is arguably following on a trend that she helped put in motion: she was working with Nordic hitmakers well before Stargate’s run of chart smashes. Lyrically, she is also exploring more mature themes. There are songs about sex and love to be sure (“Reckless.,” “Like This.”), but also joy and angst. On bonus “Clovers.,” she chronicles her struggles with depression: “No matter what the doctors offered me\\/Couldn’t shake that dark cloud off of me.” The song gives her fans, especially the ones who shed adolescence alongside her, the language to describe the fraught transition into adulthood. Perhaps the unintended advantage of being sidelined by her label was the chance it gave JoJo to bypass the common, shock-based pop starlet rebrand in favor of simply living to tell her tales on her own terms.JoJo’s original deal was with the now defunct Blackground Records, helmed by uncle of the late Aaliyah, Barry Hankerson. The association undoubtedly, if unconsciously, pushed her sound towards R&B. It also resulted in some of her debut album’s best non-single cuts. Twelve years later, Mad Love. only reinforces the idea that JoJo could thrive in the R&B sphere; “Edibles.” is proof. As she sings, “I bring all the realness to the surface\\/Does a woman like that make you nervous?” over distorted synths to her are-we-aren’t-we companion, you can’t help but wish that every other track sounded something like it. The electro-pop of Mad Love. could stand to make way to a few more slow jams, which highlight her impressive range and its raspy magic—outdone only slightly by Alessia Cara on “I Can Only.,” another standout.While JoJo sounds great on big ballads and floor-filling tracks alike, Mad Love. lacks a cohesive sound. The abrupt genre shifts are jarring at turns, but paradoxically it’s this malleability that should be key to JoJo’s continued success. Ultimately, though, Mad Love. sounds like an album that JoJo needed to make, and one that her fans were waiting for—the fans that grew up with her, went through big life changes beside her, devoured EPs and mixtapes she made despite record label obstruction, and took her back to No. 1, according to a more modern metric (the iTunes chart). On “Music.,” when she sings “every night I bet my life on you,” it’s encouraging to see that after all this time, the risk paid off.\"],[22546,\"The duo N.M.O. is composed of free improvisation and noise rock drummer Morten J. Olsen alongside sound artist Rubén Patiño, but beyond those facts defining them gets tricky. They seem gleefully aware of this, and eager to compound the confusion:  The first 100 physical copies of their debut inexplicably come with hot sauce housed in a poppers container. The album is also accompanied by an ooey gooey “Tim and Eric”-esque promo video telling the viewer, “You will not forget me” in both Spanish and English. Just like the different meanings they like to give their eponymous acronym—on top of the album title and several track names here, they’ve also interpreted it as “New Mexico Occult,” “Nederlandse Maatschappij Ontwikkeling,” and “Natalia Martínez Ordóñez,” each with its own unique set of associations—their provocations are suggestive less of an unequivocal statement than a customized index of entry points for playful, leftfield zones of thinking and feeling.There is one obvious interpretation of the hot sauce gesture, though, and it’s as an analogy for the sound of this record, which evokes the stinging overstimulation of too much intense input in a compressed time frame. Synthesizing acid-house squelch, early European hardcore, and production techniques suggestive of dub and electroacoustic musics, the duo plays with club music’s titillation until it takes on a takes on a certain disgust. In this fascination, N.M.O. recalls the work of Patiño collaborator Roc Jiménez de Cisneros’ project EVOL. The similarity between the two projects—which have both released music on Powell’s Diagonal Records imprint—is this particular blend of anguish and delight.On the surface, N.M.O.’s music evokes a now-familiar combination of dance floor beats with experimental, abrasive production techniques—labels like Hospital Productions or L.I.E.S. come to mind. But Nordic Mediterranean Organization \\/ Numerous Miscommunications Occur sets itself apart in its grating insistence. Humor is a prominent theme on the record, and it could easily soundtrack a fantastically lawless episode “Pee-wee’s Playhouse.” What makes the element of comedy work is that it’s liable to quickly turn into revulsion: the smudged viscosity of “New Bulgaria” is hard not to associate with puke, or a petri-dish science experiment gone horribly wrong. The group describes its style as “Military Space Music AND\\/OR Fluxus Techno” in promotional materials, and while this might simply seem like psilocybin raver jest, a little bit of research proves there is some conceptual conceit backing it up. In a mix and accompanying essay for the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art last year, Olsen considered “the possibility of drumming” and how it might be a “universal, even innate” form of expression, noting in particular drumming’s historical use in military communications. Upon closer inspection, this theme of militarization suffuses N.M.O.’s work from the formal level—their snares pound out authoritative patterns like a drum brigade’s—to track titles, such as “German Trained Unit 1-4,” and the names of this record’s two halves (“Nordic Mediterranean Organization” sounds like a covert operation, while “Numerous Miscommunications Occur\\\\\" might be a description thereof.) A recurring motto for the group is “As Strict As Possible,” which is itself suggestive of combat parlance.When it comes to the question of what they’re militarizing and why, though, N.M.O.’s stance is blurry. Indeed, where music can be a useful site of staged antagonism between opposing social groups, the conflict here is free-floating, not tied to individual actors. In this way, the record channels something of our current moment’s topography of war, fought between overlapping and oftentimes contradictory configurations of nation states, corporations, insurgent militias, software companies, anonymous hacking collectives, activist groups, local police, and others. Even though Nordic Mediterranean Organization \\/ Numerous Miscommunications Occur defines itself in relation to a series of real-life references, even leaving a trail of cues temping the listener to decode an overarching approach or sensibility, at the end of the day the fundamental impulse seems to be towards wonkiness for wonkiness’ sake. Their emotional register is impulsivity held mid-squirm, constantly interrupting itself with cartoonish locked grooves (“Neoliberal Madness Offering 1-4”) and march-like vignettes (“German Trained Unit 1-4”). It’s all very fittingly closed out with “Abhaengen,” which suggests variously “to hang” or “to hang out”: tonally evocative much less that of a finale than an intermission, it conveys that Olsen and Patiño are already moving onto other things, deciding what else N.M.O. could stand for.\"],[22526,\"American Football were a band destined to flourish in a specific time and place—it just happened to come at the turn of this decade, 10 years or so after they stopped making new music. Earnest, energetic and often ignored by critics, late-90s, Midwestern emo—defined by American Football, Braid and the Promise Ring—was ripe for reassessment around 2010 and fittingly found its audience in a moment where indie shifted hard towards avant-R&B  cool and college-quad chill. Regardless of when this new vanguard emerged, it’s proven incredibly resilient, with nearly all of its scene leaders releasing their best work in the past year. Unlike, say, freak-folk or dance-punk, emo in the 2010s doesn’t seem like a reactionary microtrend so much as the current prevailing sound of indie rock. And its single biggest influence is American Football’s sole, self-titled album of elliptical, post-rock and jazz-inflected emo, which transmogrified from one of the many short-lived and modestly revered offshoots of the Cap’n Jazz family tree (i.e., Friend\\/Enemy, Owls, Make Believe)  to an essential part of the canon—steering the genre from Hot Topic and Warped Tour into headier territory. Earlier this year, Mike Kinsella told us American Football never intended “to be popular, or even be a band.” They’re unquestionably both now, and the second American Football might be the most highly anticipated emo album ever made.Kinsella is too self-deprecating to milk whatever mystique American Football has accumulated; LP2 exists because the band enjoyed touring but was tired of having to play the same songs. He’s also too self-aware to not acknowledge that LP2 has expectations. “Where are we now?” he asks on the first new American Football song of the 21st century. “Both home alone, in the same house”—you know, like the one on both album covers. The title of each song here is the first line; on American Football, they were the last line. The think pieces write themselves.But upon establishing this type of secret-handshake rapport with the diehard listener, the type for whom this is the equivalent of anxiously awaited, decades-spanning sequels m b v or Wildflower or Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...Pt. 2, “Where Are We Now?” pivots and speaks to the festival crowds and the 3,000-cap rooms. For one thing, there’s a chorus— something that American Football lacked altogether—a klieg-lighted, waltz-time sway with moaning guitar leads, the kind that typified Sunny Day Real Estate in their later prog phase. The 4\\/4 kick drum thump in the first verse of lead single “I’ve Been So Lost For So Long” works on a similar level—the crowd is going to clap along to this one, it’s “the hit” now. While the new wave of emo hasn’t yet produced a Jimmy Eat World-level crossover, these songs ask, why not American Football themselves?Produced in spurts of Dropbox exchanges and playdates over the span of two years, but working on a strict deadline, LP2 stresses proficiency and immediacy. Play it back-to-back with the original, knocked out in a weekend with college graduation looming, and Kinsella’s stated belief that American Football circa-2016 is a massive upgrade doesn’t seem all that heretical. The production is bracingly bright and crisp compared to the overcast American Football, hitting like the first true fall chill after a muggy Indian summer. They’re also sharper songwriters than they were as University of Illinois undergrads—the twin guitars no longer intermingle with fuzzy friction, they’re gridlocked into Pinback-like metronomy on “My Instincts Are the Enemy,” while “Desire Gets in the Way” punches out of the somber Side B, almost indistinguishable from Kinsella’s punkier protegees from Into It. Over It.Sturdy song structures, legitimate hooks, a full-time bassist (Mike’s cousin, Nate Kinsella)—some of this can be seen as troubleshooting for a bigger audience. But the aspect upon which every opinion on LP2 will hinge is that American Football has a frontman now. There are no instrumentals or even the extended passages of “Honestly?” and “Stay Home” that predicted the sweeping post-emo of The World Is a Beautiful Place and I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Foxing. With his vocals pushed pop-star high in the mix, Kinsella is a dominating presence, and LP2 sounds suspiciously familiar. Nine songs of Mike Kinsella assessing his self-worth in taut, spare songs of spindly guitar and tenderized vocals, well—that essentially describes Kinsella’s long-running solo project Owen. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that. Owen albums are consistently pretty good, but there are nine of them: including one that came out not three months ago. The King of Whys is the first Owen release to follow the American Football reboot and whether or not that was responsible for a heightened interest in the project, the album was recorded with a full band and an outside producer who likes the same bells, whistles and trumpets—it’s the Owen record that sounds the most like American Football. For fans who want a second masterwork as vindication for American Football, LP2 doesn’t exude the stakes it should, not when it’s so easy to see “Empty Bottle” and the Volcano Choir-esque “Settled Down” as possibly culled from the same well of inspiration that provides “I Need a Drink (Or Two, or Three)” and the “Holocene”-esque “Home Is Where the Haunt Is.”  In a more tangible way, the rebrand of American Football as a straightforward songwriting outfit inevitably relegates their inventive musicianship to the periphery. Within limited pockets of space, “Give Me the Gun” reconfigures American Football’s history to place them as contemporaries and neighbors of Tortoise as well as acolytes of Steve Reich and the Blue Nile. Meanwhile, the spiraling codas of “Born to Lose” and “I Need a Drink (Or Two or Three)” are layered, nuanced, emotionally complex and in sharp contrast to the record’s clunkiest vocals (“dead eyes, why such vulgarity?,” “I can’t break this bender, to it I surrender”).And as he is on Owen records, Kinsella is a high-variance kind of lyricist here. Kinsella admitted that he was writing lyrics for LP2 until the last minute and at points, it's questionable whether he would've been better off spending more effort writing or less. Stock phrases can work as mantras when they stay within their cadence (“Home Is Where the Haunt Is”) and other times, lyrics that read embarrassing from a guy pushing 40 can conceivably work in an arrested-development, Beach-Slang sort of way. Then again, James Alex’s sole purpose is to remain in his 20s; when Kinsella plaintively sings, “Doctor it hurts when I exist” and “I’m as blue as the sky is gray...I’m gonna die this way,” it’s unclear whether they’re meant to be taken at face value, or if we’re all supposed to see it as an emo elder statesman playing the role for laughs. But this question doesn’t really change the nature of the band—American Football wasn’t some self-released obscurity in 1999 when Kinsella was best known as a former member of Cap’n Jazz and even then, “I’ll See You When We’re Both Not So Emotional” alone proves Kinsella doesn’t see sincerity and self-awareness as opposed. But even if the influences and underlying sentiments are quite similar this time out, American Football shouldn’t be expected to musically, or emotionally, express themselves the same way they did when they were in their late teens. Made by, and largely for, college-aged emo fans, American Football reflected a time when hours on end could spent staring off into the distance to consider the changing leaves and lost loves while “The One With the Wurlitzer” faded out. In 2016, the members of American Football have spouses, kids, publishing careers, office jobs, the things that makes nostalgia for a bygone moment an indulgence rather than a sustainable worldview. To paraphrase Homer Simpson, LP2 is by and for people who are lucky to find a half hour a week in which to get wistful.  \"],[22529,\"Like Britain's answer to the late Wesley Willis, Sleaford Mods essentially adhere to one single-minded aesthetic and wring it for every last drop. In fact, frontman Jason Williamson's rants, torrential profanity, and insistent use of song titles as choruses all echo Willis. Ditto for Andrew Fearn's skeletal loops, which recall Willis' trademark use of crude Casiotone presets as background music.However, Willis's mental illness tinged his music with uncomfortable hints of exploitation, where you can laugh at the Mods guilt-free: When they perform live, Fearn resigns himself to the role of stageprop, affecting stony nonchalance as he bops awkwardly, beer in hand, barely touching his laptop, almost as if to communicate that his presence isn't necessary. That couldn't be further from the truth, evinced perhaps more than ever on the new five-song EP T.C.R..Since Fearn joined in time to construct the backing tracks for Sleaford Mods' fifth album, 2012's Wank, he's structured the songs so that each has but one part. Fearn throws in extra touches here and there to accent certain lyrics and create buildup, but the songs don't actually change. Williamson, meanwhile, has basically relied on one phrasing method all along: rapid-fire tirades depicting the most drearily mundane aspects of English life. The combined effect can give the impression that Sleaford Mods are little more than boneheaded street-corner provocateurs relying on shock, vulgarity, and name-calling.Sleaford Mods actually stretch a bit for the first four of the five songs on T.C.R.. After eight full-lengths and a handful of EPs, they are finally allowing their music to breathe somewhat. Not that Fearn has radically altered his formula, but the surprisingly upbeat synth figure and (relative) fullness of the arrangement on opening track “TCR” suggest that they are at least searching for new ways to color their songs. Throughout the EP, in fact, Fearn wears his new wave and post-punk influences on his sleeve, echoing the likes of Devo, the Fall, and others while managing to sound startlingly contemporary. Williamson once again comes to the table with a parade of people he deems worthy of hurling obscenities at. \\\\\"Go and listen to some fuckin' garage punk, you pointy little tit!\\\\\" he shouts at some poor soul on title track “TCR.” We've heard this before from Williamson, but he's still adept at balancing bite with humor and genuine observation.Most shockingly, though, Williamson allows naked self-doubt to creep into the picture right off the bat, dedicating the very first verse to the twin pressures of parenthood and aging. His depiction of a father who feels harried at home and wants to go out, only to feel out of place once he gets there, verges on touching. “The wails of ya offspring behind ya cracking window,” he says, his spoken word delivery significantly slowed down, more weary than agitated. “It's hard, innit? When you plan to do something but at that moment you realize it's not quite right, not really something you should be doing tonight.” (The title “T.C.R.” is a reference to Total Control Racing, a failed brand of 1970s toy-car track sets, a reference Williamson makes as a metaphor for spinning one's wheels.)As usual, Williamson contorts rapping and Beat poetry just enough to fit into neither category. And, like before, hearing him take-in huge gulps of air between verses in a dizzying flow of disconnected images and references is thrilling whether you understand the social context for them or not. And the gag still hasn't worn thin when Williamson double-tracks incredulous lines like “You're taking the fuckin' piss out of me, man?” In spots, Williamson even nods to his past life as a quote-unquote singer. But after directors Paul Sng and Nathan Hannawin positioned Sleaford Mods as the most vital voice of Brexit-bound England in their 2015 film Invisible Britain, T.C.R.'s lack of discernible commentary on the street-level impact of the Brexit vote is puzzling (especially now that Morrissey has weighed in).  Nevertheless, Williamson's shift towards looking at his own life rescues him from becoming the type of self-righteous caricature he might himself have railed on. When you slag on everything and view the world with nothing but disdain, it's inevitable that you're going to back yourself into a corner. As a result, it’s a welcome change even when Williamson resorts to the well-trodden path of bitching about touring life on “Dad's Corner.” And, though hearing him attack other people is still delicious fun—especially when he's got figures like Oasis in his crosshairs—it was only a matter of time before someone came along and pointed the finger back at him. On T.C.R., Williamson beats everyone to the punch.A teaser of sorts for a full-length the band has planned for next year, T.C.R. doesn't contain anything as infectiously catchy—or even irreverent—as “Jobseeker,” “Mr. Jolly Fucker,” or “14 Day Court.” Still, the gurgling dark funk of “Dad's Corner,” the speedy dub groove of “Britain Thirst,” and other subtle signs of progress bode well for the future. And while T.C.R. raises questions about the energy level Fearn and Williamson will be able to sustain over a full-length album with a more tentative attack, even more than previous work it makes their artfulness hard to overlook.\"],[22500,\"After Hours opens like a dream sequence. Seagulls circle the sky, waves crash onto empty beaches. A crackly police scanner reveals a cop and dispatcher discussing arrests. It’s hard to tell if it’s dusk or dawn; twilight tends to warp time. But these are the protean hours that a certain set live for and that Jubilee recreates on After Hours. Where other dance albums often focus on just the club, for Jubilee, everything before, after, and in between is just as important. On her long-awaited debut full-length, the Miami-born, Manhattan-based DJ and producer née Jessica Gentile pays tribute to the nightlife that raised her. Influenced by countless drives through Miami, the LP takes on a breezy, balmy feel different from Jubilee’s past Mixpak releases. Where her last three EPs (Pull Ova, Jealous, and JMZ Riddim) were harder and more percussive, After Hours is dreamier and more melodic. She still draws on many of the sounds she’s known for—dancehall, Miami bass, trap, among others—but this time, her music is concerned not just with the immediate moment but also with reflections on past ones.Each track stands as its own memory and its own vignette, but as memories are wont to do, the edges bleed together, so that After Hours also functions like a 38-minute, South Florida-obsessed club mix. On “Stingray Shuffle,” Jubilee playfully references the shuffle that beachgoers do to avoid getting stung in shallow waters. A prickly, arpeggiated motif dances across a pounding beat, reminiscent of Frankie Knuckles’ “Your Love,” except faster and with a Detroit techno nod to DJ Stingray. “Sawgrass Expressway,” named after the expressway that runs through Broward County where Gentile grew up, also draws on house and techno, but with a sparser, more robotic feel. Both tracks are made for the club, but here they suggest spaces outside of it—getting ready beforehand, or barreling down an open road after.At the club proper, lead single “Wine Up” is a dancehall jam with a chutney soca feel, by way of synthesized dhantal rhythms. A repeating four-note motif gestures toward Gyptian’s “Hold Yuh,” while Bronx-based dancehall artist Hoodcelebrityy demands the room, to “Wine up gyal, w-wine up yuh body!\\/Wine up gyal, r-r-ride di riddim!” Similarly, on “Bass Supply,” Miami mischief-maker Otto Von Schirach raps, “Swing that ass, swing it round and round!\\/Pound that shit, on the fucking ground!” Jubilee, meanwhile, interpolates the Miami bass track with an array of effects that she triggers as if playing Bop It—water droplets, slide whistles, unruly springs, 808 cowbells.All throughout, Jubilee builds a consistent sense of place, shaping a loose narrative. In some ways, the album pivots on the track “JMZ Interlude,” which finds the listener ejected abruptly from the bawdy world of Von Schirach into the busy city streets. Using her 2014 Brooklyn-inspired “JMZ Riddim,” the interlude sketches the familiar scenario of trying to catch a ride to the next spot. Exclamations of “Brooklyn bruk!” cut through the cacophony of honking cars and blaring sirens. By the time the car doors slam shut, a slightly off-kilter stop\\/walk light starts ticking for what feels like forever. Finally, the ambient “Snooze Button” ushers in a brief daydream and some relief. At least, that’s one interpretation. The narrative arc of the album isn’t entirely clear-cut. But then again, neither are many nights out.Either way, there’s no denying that After Hours is a meticulously produced affair. Every bass line and syncopated rhythm and subtle inflection fits precisely one into the other. Yet it always maintains enough space to breathe and, very often, to glitter: the same prickly pattern we first hear on “Stingray Shuffle” recurs throughout the record, shape-shifting just so to evoke different images and moods. On “Opa-Locka,” an homage to the city just south of Broward County, bells twinkle like stars over a spry reggae rhythm. The atmospheric “Spa Day” feels like speeding past the ocean, with the sun glinting off its corrugated surface. A slow-winding kizomba groove anchors the track, and 909 toms bounce from one side of the listener’s sonic periphery to the other as bits of conversation float by. By the end, on album closer “Beach Ball,” swells of ambient noise rise and fall like columns of warm air, buoying bobbing flutes and skittering hi-hats. The tiniest gleam of morning light stains the horizon, easily blotting out any memory of police dispatchers or hungry gulls. Waves lap gently against the shore, and we feel it in our lungs: that these are the hours we live for.\"],[22548,\"Knowingly or not, Crying saddled themselves with a lot of baggage when they first formed at SUNY Purchase in 2013. Early in the New York indie rock trio’s existence, guitarist Ryan Galloway took to programming synthesizer lines derived from old Game Boy software, which led many to understand them as a chiptune act. But then their name, and later their association with the Boston label Run For Cover records (“There are a lot of sad men,” Galloway said of the label in a recent interview with Village Voice) have led others to call them an emo band. Neither term is particularly damning in 2016, and they were accurate on some level, at least insomuch as the EPs Get Olde and Second Wind had their moments of sullen introspection and sugar-rush abandon.But their debut LP, Beyond the Fleeting Gales, is different, folding the big-screen bombast of mainstream '80s rock into their sound. Toting a whole gleaming new set of synthesizers and some surprisingly complicated riffing,  Gales transforms the band completely. The experience is sort of like catching a show you used to watch on a CRTV in high def for the first time. Despite the stadium-sized scale of Galloway’s thunderstruck riffs on songs like “Patriot,” a subtlety that was once elided creeps to the forefront. If nothing else, it’s a treat to hear his legato runs sounding more like Guitar Hero than the bit-crushed rhythm violence of their older works.It’s a metamorphosis that’s folded into the lyrics of the record. Even the opening track “Premonitory Dream” seems to acknowledge the shock of personal transformation. Over vaporous synth pads and a guitar riff as hair-raising as anything between Rivers Cuomo and Eddie Van Halen, singer Elaiza Santos finds herself on pausing on the middle of a shoddily constructed bridge, unsure whether to go forward or back. She mulls the “risk of burdening the wood and rope I’d already passed,” and ultimately decides to press on. The ascendant riff takes off once she’s made her decision. This is music meant to soundtrack the delicate process of figuring out who you are in relation to the world around you. Openness, in this case and throughout the record, is rewarded; pushing forward is met with joy.\\\\\"There Was a Door” was released as a single on National Coming Out Day and the song is a sort of public affirmation of the self, punctuated in pitch-shifted guitar licks. Like their fellow New York riff-slingers PWR BTTM, their music can occasionally be read as a playful, grinning inversion of the hetero-masculinity that’s often baked into these sorts of guitar fireworks—a surprisingly-radical suggestion that a sweep-picked guitar solo can be for everyone, not just for oversexed cis dudes with big hair. Beyond the Fleeting Gales is a record about these simple victories, and surprising moments of optimism reclaiming simple pleasures and pressing on in the face of an oppressive world. That’s the message at the heart of “There Was a Door.” You face a threshold; cross through and there’s peace, maybe, or at least something worth singing about.\"],[22524,\"At the start of the decade, Lady Gaga worked hard to reposition pop as a high art or vice-versa—both absorbing and extending a lineage that included oddball visionaries like Andy Warhol, Klaus Nomi, Prince, David Bowie, Grace Jones, Elton John, Madonna, and Missy Elliott. Most of her avant-garde gestures were extra-musical, a string of cheeky, absurdist visions realized entirely outside of the studio and only tangentially in conversation with her bloodless dance jams (Gaga herself has referred to that early work as “soulless electronic pop”). It’s not hard, now, to recall these stunts from memory: she was sewn into a dress fashioned from slabs of flank steak for the VMAs. She hatched herself from a semi-translucent egg at the Grammys. She hired a self-described “vomit artist” to puke a steady stream of syrupy green liquid onto her bosom during a SXSW performance. Her repeated and earnest disavowal of anything remotely normative was (and remains) plainly empowering for anyone sitting at home alone in her room, feeling like a true weirdo. The idea was always to fracture and reestablish a hierarchy. Only Gaga could turn “monster” into a term of endearment.And regardless of whether you find those moves electrifying or tedious, it's hard to overstate the value of that work as a public service—every generation’s freaks elect a champion, and Gaga was tireless, proud, and wholly devoted to the job. Her commercial success also meant that her chart peers were, for better or worse, free to get stranger, artier, and less predictable; Gaga helped usher in an era of pop in which hardly anything is too far-out (or pretentious) to play. Visual provocations of one sort or another are expected now: Sia performed “Chandelier” at the Grammys with her back to the audience, wearing a bobbed, platinum wig, while Kristen Wiig and the then-twelve-year old dancer Maddie Ziegler frolicked around her in nude bodysuits. Miley Cyrus gyrates among furries as a matter of routine. But now that her peers have caught up, Gaga is starting to feel less like an audacious pioneer and more like one among many.  Joanne, which is named after her late aunt—a sexual assault survivor who died of lupus at nineteen—experiments with rootsier idioms like country and folk, maybe as a kind of goofy gesture toward authenticity, or maybe just to distance herself further from 2013’s overblown and gloppy ARTPOP. Gaga has always sounded most comfortable belting out rich, brawny pop songs while wiggling around a piano bench, and her best tracks, like the deeply irresistible “Yoü and I,” from 2011’s Born This Way, are reminiscent of the more virtuosic fringes of glam-rock (“You and I” features inimitable Queen guitarist Brian May, a drumbeat that nods directly to “We Will Rock You,” and harmonies that very nearly recall “Bohemian Rhapsody”). Glam—its blatant preoccupation with fame and stardom, its mischievous and inelegant tendencies, its emphasis on the theatrical, the visual, the decadent, the garish—made sense for Gaga, both for her voice (while robust and often lovely, it is not exactly nuanced; the little fissures and breaks that typically animate folk songs aren’t instinctive to her) and for her fantastical, psychedelic-leaning visual taste. A move toward singer-songwriter earnestness now—especially following Cheek to Cheek, the collection of jazz standards she recorded with Tony Bennett, itself a purposeful expression of seriousness, maturity—feels unnecessary.Gaga has repeated Warhol’s claim that “art should be meaningful in the most shallow way,” but Warhol also insisted on a kind of surreal detachment from flesh—“Sex is so abstract,” he once said. Gaga’s disembodiment feels less deliberate. Joanne never reveals much of a narrative or stylistic through-line, and even her brief dips into indie-rock – her collaborations with Father John Misty on “Sinner’s Prayer” and “Come to Mama” (Misty is also credited as a writer on Beyonce’s Lemonade), and Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker on “Perfect Illusion” (Rihanna covered Parker’s “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” on Anti)—feel familiar. Joanne is rife with visitors, though none make themselves especially known: Mark Ronson (who co-produces), Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine, Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. “Dancin’ in Circles,” a song she co-wrote with Beck, is a clubby paean to self-love with a grody pre-chorus: “Up all night, tryna’ rub the pain out,” she chants. In 2016, masturbation-as-engine-of-escape isn’t a particularly titillating topic (in the decades since “She Bop,” Hailee Steinfeld, Nicki Minaj, Pink, the Pussycat Dolls, Britney Spears, and plenty of others have recorded tracks about getting themselves off), nor the instance of Beck-Gaga collusion anyone was hoping for (imagine, for a moment, if he had brought her “Debra”). Though Gaga addresses a handful of serious concerns here, some topical, some personal—the murder of Trayvon Martin; what happens to a person after she dies—her treatment of them often feels clumsy if not performative (in “Angel Down,” an ode to the Black Lives Matter movement, she sings, “Angel down \\/ Why do people just stand around?” while Ronson sadly plays a Mellotron).Elsewhere, there are hints of a smaller, more personal arc: Gaga’s got it for someone she knows is bad news, but she’s not sure if she can walk away just yet. “Perfect Illusion,” the record’s first single, struggled to chart (it debuted at number fifteen on the Hot 100), but has a propulsive, dizzying quality that feels like a pretty good analogue for the process of completely losing your mind over someone, only to realize later you’ve been hoodwinked: “Mistaken for love, it wasn’t love, it was a perfect illusion,” Gaga bellows, her fire-hose voice big, unchecked, wild. She sounds indignant but also vaguely unhinged—like she’s figured out she’s playing a rigged game, but still refuses to fold her hand. Opener “Diamond Heart” has Homme on guitar, but the best moments are Gaga’s: “Young wild American \\/ C’mon, baby, do you have a girlfriend?” she wonders in the chorus. It’s the same story on “Million Reasons,” co-written with Hillary Lindsey (who collaborated with Carrie Underwood on “Jesus, Take the Wheel”), an undeniable power ballad Poison would’ve murdered in 1988: “I bow down to pray,” Gaga sings at her piano. “I try to make the worse seem better.” This kind of semi-desperate negotiating will be uncomfortably familiar to anyone who has tried to will a doomed situation into something viable. Her man’s already given her a million reasons to split. “But baby, I just need one good one to stay.” Sartorially, Gaga has recently come to favor civilian get-ups; just last week, she returned to the Bitter End, the tiny, Greenwich Village venue where she got her start, wearing short-shorts and a sheer, Bud Light-branded tank top (Bud Light sponsored her Dive Bar tour). In the video for \\\\\"Perfect Illusion,\\\\\" she wears denim cutoffs, black combat boots, a black t-shirt, and a blonde ponytail. I sported a similar look—though with far less success—nearly every school day between 1995 and 1997. But nobody wants to immediately recognize herself in Gaga’s aesthetic; we want her to suggest a path we hadn’t thought of before, to nurture and clarify a beauty we didn’t even realize was there. Joanne feels too self-conscious, an affront to the Gaga of yesteryear—the truest self, after all, isn’t always the quietest.  \"],[22324,\"Before Tanya Tagaq is about to perform, she takes a few moments to speak to her audience. There’s the usual business of thanking everyone for coming out and introducing her band, though she also likes to talk about what’s on her mind—sometimes for a good 10 minutes before we hear a note of music. In the context of what follows, the preamble feels less like an introduction than a farewell, like the sort of address you hear from astronauts before they’re launched into space, or an escape artist who’s about to pull off an elaborate, death-defying stunt. That’s because Tagaq goes to places in her music that few others dare to tread. And when she’s in the throes of her violent, carnal, gesticulating concerts—which feel more like séances than performances—you’re not sure if that sweet, cheerful woman who was just bantering with the crowd will make it back alive.Tagaq hails from the Arctic territory of Nunavut in northern Canada, raised in a remote island town called Cambridge Bay that’s inaccessible by road. Her Inuk mother introduced her to their culture’s tradition of throat-singing, which is less a musical artform than a community pastime where two women square off face-to-face in friendly competition, producing heaving, gnarled, guttural sounds in responsive rhythmic patterns. But through Tagaq, this interactive activity has become a vehicle for primal, personal, political expression. Onstage, Tagaq doesn’t so much sing as plug herself into the Earth, transforming herself into a mood-ring manifestation of a ravaged planet squealing in pain with each oil-drill jab and earth-scorching heat wave. Atop her band’s swelling, screeching soundscapes, Tagaq’s sleeping-giant purrs mutate into death metal-worthy growls—and when she snaps out of her trance an hour later, it feels like you’ve just borne witness to Godspeed You Black Exorcist.Tagaq belongs to a lineage of iconoclastic vocalists that includes Yoko Ono and Diamanda Galás—artists notorious for pushing both musical and physical limits in their work. And her extreme approach has engendered collaborations with the likes of Björk, Kronos Quartet, Mike Patton, and Fucked Up. But Tagaq’s new album arrives at a moment when she’s on the verge of becoming Canada’s unlikeliest crossover act. Her previous record, Animism, won the Polaris Music Prize in 2014, leading to several high-profile festival appearances and TED Talks; she can even currently be heard on mainstream Canadian radio singing back-up on the latest single from Toronto alt-rockers July Talk. But most crucially, the restless, raging Retribution emerges at a time when Canada is reckoning with its historic, government-sanctioned mistreatment of the country’s indigenous population—a long-simmering, long-suppressed topic that’s now become an explosive flashpoint in the national conversation, much as systemic, anti-black racism has in the U.S.In Canada, the operative word right now is “reconciliation,” the process by which the government hopes to make amends with the indigenous community for the awful legacy of Canada’s residential-school system. From the mid-19th century till 1996, the system separated indigenous children from their families and forced them into church-led classrooms as a means to assimilate them into white, Christian, Canadian society. And the coercion, sadly, went beyond the curriculum—students were subjected to horrific, unchecked abuse at the hands of their supposed educators, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 6,000 children over the years. For Tagaq—an alumnus of the system—reconciliation has been a slow, ineffective, bureaucratic process. As the title of her new record makes clear, she wants retribution. And not just for Canada’s under-the-rug history of cultural genocide, but for the current plights of her people: the epidemic number of indigenous women who are abducted, raped, and murdered in Canada each year, and the environmental havoc wreaked by the country’s tar sand-sucking oil industry.As a singer who deals mostly in wordless expression, Tagaq’s most pointed political statements have been broadcast through extramusical means: her fearlessly profane interviews, her hyperactive Twitter feed, and her jaw-dropping Polaris-gala performance, where she used her national stage to project the names of 1,200 missing or murdered indigenous women. And to top it off, she used her acceptance speech to flip off PETA for its opposition to seal hunting, on which Tagaq’s isolated community depends for sustenance.But on Retribution, the messaging is baked right into the music. Much like those aforementioned pre-show speeches, Retribution provides instant exposition in the form of its title track, where, over a panting vocal pulse, Tagaq offers a spoken-word treatise: “Our mother grows angry\\/Retribution will be swift\\/We squander her soil and suck out her sweet, black blood to burn it.” But Tagaq isn’t preaching to the choir. She’s stirring the beast, alternating her voice between a panicked yelp and an esophagus-shredding grunt, while piercing violins horsewhip the band into a furious gallop.Like Animism, Tagaq recorded Retribution with the core duo of violinist Jesse Zubot and percussionist Jean Martin, whose free-form sound-scraping blurs the lines between folk, classical, klezmer, post-rock, musique concrete, and slasher-flick soundtrack. The new album trades in queasy atmospherics for a more robust rhythmic attack, with Tagaq feeding off the band’s energy as much as vice versa. “Aorta” explodes with a disorienting swirl of seagull squeals, foghorn-like drones, and vocals that sound like they’re being sung backwards. But the song’s brawny groove indulges the fantasy of hearing Tagaq unleash her gnashed-teeth roar in a hard-rock context. And there’s even a straight-up, boom-bap throwback in “Centre,” on which guest MC Shad’s circular rhymes ruminate on humanity’s infinitesimal place in the universe at large, while Tagaq’s melodic counter-vocal celebrates our own microscopic, menstrual origins by coining her own genre: “wombcore.”By more readily embracing rock and rap forms, Retribution stands to lure a wider audience into Tagaq’s unsettled sound world—but only to ensnare it like prey as she goes in for the kill. “Cold” is the most harrowing science-class lecture you’ll ever hear: Tagaq recites the effects of global warming on the Arctic, before ominously declaring, “Human civilization as we know it will no longer exist… because Gaia likes it cold.” The song’s stalking groove then goads her into a symphony of screams that renders melting ice as burning flesh. And where Retribution’s more muscular moments are countered by amorphous, aggro-ambient pieces like “Nacreous” and “Sulfur,” the centerpiece track “Summoning” bridges the extremes. Over the course of nine tumultuous minutes, the song unfolds like a found-sound radio opera, with Toronto’s 50-strong Element Choir gradually taunting and prodding a terrified Tagaq as if she were being offered up for ceremonial sacrifice.Retribution is very much a mirror image of Aninism: Where the latter record opened with a reverential, orchestro-folk cover of the Pixies’ “Caribou” and closed with the disturbing, nightmarish moans of “Fracking,” Retribution’s turbulent journey settles onto familiar turf with a cover of another alt-rock classic. Tagaq’s “Caribou” was a cheeky, celebratory act of cultural reclamation from someone raised hunting the namesake animal (not to mention someone who can out-scream Black Francis). Here, her eerily calm cover of Nirvana’s “Rape Me” transforms Kurt Cobain’s narrative role-play into unflinching autobiography, with its disturbing allusions to the multiple sexual assaults Tagaq was subjected to as a child.But when Tagaq sings, “I’m not the only one,” she’s speaking for more than just fellow survivors. “Rape Me” marks the moment where the intersectional relationship among Retribution’s primary concerns—feminism, environmentalism, indigenous rights—is laid bare, with a hushed Tagaq staking out the liminal space between feeling defeated and feeling defiant. And by the end, the song’s incessant drum beat sounds more like a death rattle—a tick-tock reminder that retribution is not some distant prophecy, but a looming inevitability.\"],[22442,\"With over twenty years of record-making behind him, Oval’s Markus Popp had long established his bona fides as a legend of the strain of electronic music that used to be called IDM. But once he returned in 2010 after a near-ten year absence from recording, he seemed liberated, as if the distance had granted him freedom from the monolithic formula of his first decade of work. With the self-referentially titled Popp, his fifth record since his return, he has delivered his most consistent and well-rounded collection since 2001’s Ovalcommers, showing a side of, well, pop to his music that has often dwelled below the surface but never so overtly above it.Though it’s only been six years since releasing the double-disc O and Oh EP, Popp represents a third new iteration of the Oval sound since his return from retirement. On those two releases Popp applied new techniques to generating music that lead to tracks that ultimately sounded like brighter, more austere versions of his older records like ‘98’s Szenariodisk. Oval 2.0 came in 2013 in the form of the two self-released, collaborative records Calidostópia! and Voa, which saw Popp break new ground in pairings with a number of South American musicians. Though the uneven results alternated from the “eh” to the sublime (such as on Voa’s incredible “Drift” with Agustín Albrieu, which sounded like Oval plus Thom Yorke-meets-David Sylvain), they represented a big shift in sound and ideas and were his most song-based work since contributing to Gastr del Sol’s final record Camofleur in 1998.On Popp, he takes things in yet another entirely new direction, one that manages to play with the past in a way that feels entirely interested in the future. Warm, sunny and frenetic, Popp represents his closest play toward actual pop music that Oval (or any of Popp’s other monikers) has ever made, even more so than Calidostópia! and Voa.Two big factors contributing to the shift in feel of Popp are the use of drums and vocals, albeit sampled. Beginning immediately with album opener “Ai,” Popp lays down a choppy 4\\/4 rhythm that combines samples and actual drumming into a tower of beat that feels like standing beneath a rainbow-hued waterfall. Around the edges are the clipped coos that lend to an unexpectedly club-like feel. Popp is no longer playing with these sounds to provide texture, but to create a woozily busy form of futuristic dance music. The rest of the album continues in this way, working hard to create an almost uninterrupted wall of sound. But the best of Popp begins midway through, as he shifts his gaze slowly from house and rave music to classic-era Warp Records IDM. “Ku” has a playful steel drum synth line that would sound at home on any of Plaid’s records, but laid over a storm of beats far busier than they would ever program. Better still is the halycon “Sa,” which channels Tri Repetae and LP5-era Autechre in its use of nagging, industrial machine-like melodies that churn while the song lurches slowly backward and forward to conclusion. Unlike much of Popp, “Sa” builds gently from quiet solemnity to cacophonous, triumphant joy in a way that is both reflective and redemptive.Popp wraps with the rapturous and sunkissed “Ve,” which somehow stretches out gloriously and seems to end too soon. It’s worth noting that each of Popp's eleven cuts fall between 3:20 to 4:30 minutes long; gone are the 1-2 minute “ringtone” sketches of O or the lengthy drone extensions of past works like 94diskont's classic “Do While.” The focus he displays across the record over its 44 minutes, which never drag, is impressive, and the inspired post-pop composition of Popp easily provides the best argument yet for its creator’s continued relevance, not just as a legend but a creative force in electronic music for the next decade.\"],[22516,\"Among other qualities, jazz has often provided a meeting ground for complexity and catchiness. In the 1920s and ’30s, “Harlem Stride” pianists held down chairs in the experimental music vanguard, while also becoming some of America’s first dance-music hitmakers. Ever since, experts have debated the “ideal” mixture of exploration and approachability. But both attributes are understood as crucial in the genre—and it’s always a thrill to encounter an artist who can balance the imperatives.Trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson’s second album as a bandleader provides plenty of this excitement. Where his debut recording was an accomplished set, it also bore a strong resemblance to the work of saxophonist-composer Steve Coleman. That stylistic debt was come by honestly, as Finlayson has played his mentor’s complex, rhythmically cycling compositions for over a decade. But Moving Still hits in a more distinct way. While Finlayson is already held in high regard for his work with players like Henry Threadgill and Mary Halvorson, this album shows that the trumpeter is every bit as much a composer on the rise.His counterpoint writing is still dense and active, but the tunes on top flow with greater ease. On the pulsing “Flank and Center,” members of Finlayson’s band have to navigate quick handoffs, passing the melodic line from one instrument to the next in quick succession. This is a common trick in contemporary jazz, meant to show off the dexterity of a group—though the melodic line itself can sometimes feels like an afterthought. No so here. Pianist Matt Mitchell and guitarist Miles Okazaki hit their notes with nervy energy, while Finlayson’s turns on trumpet often result in smooth and attractive completions of a phrase. The trumpeter’s subtlety extends to his own solo, where he flips an expected script: turning his tone even mellower, rather than becoming flashier.Similar expressions of drive and lyricism are achieved with consistency on other tracks. The introduction to lengthy album opener “All of the Pieces” presents some of Okazaki’s most sublime playing, before the guitarist steers the full band into a swinging mood. Bassist John Hébert shows off a range of strummed and bowed techniques during “Between Moves”—a ruminative piece that turns hot in its final minutes. Mitchell’s piano is required to be both graceful (“Cap vs. Nim”) and clattering (“Space And”). At different points, Craig Weinrib’s percussion reveals his affinity for funk and ballad-style accompaniment. (Considered alongside his appearance on Henry Threadgill’s most recent album, it’s clear Weinrib has had a good 2016.) Aside from all the fine soloistic moments, the band members excel in mixing these stylistic paints. The guitarist and rhythm section may suggest fusions with rock and soul, even while engaging with long, tricky lines composed by Finlayson. The ensemble’s sound can have the “cooking” feel much admired in hard-bop, even as the harmonic language stretches into modernist realms. The result is an overarching mood of delightful invention. Finlayson finds inspiration in chess, titling songs and even this group after aspects of the game. And though there are flashes of schematic obsessiveness in his work, he can also channel the gracefulness that’s apparent in any well-played contest. It’s not easy to create an original sound that “makes it new” and “keeps it traditional” at once, but at age 34—and after years of work alongside icons like AACM co-founder Muhal Richard Abrams—this trumpeter is there.\"],[22514,\"Leonard Cohen has been bidding his farewell for decades, since before we ever met him. In 1966, he opened Beautiful Losers—his mystical, lysergic, gleefully obscene second novel—with the sunset plea, “Can I love you in my own way? I am an old scholar, better-looking now than when I was young. That’s what sitting on your ass does to your face.” He was just 32 then, rakish without ravaging, not yet celebrated for pairing wry, elegant sacrilege to folk melodies—a year before courting “Suzanne,” 18 from raising his “Hallelujah.” But even then, he was conscious and deferential to the light waning around him.Which is a placidity his followers don’t always share; what other 82-year-old artist could possibly acknowledge his impending mortality and alarm his fans enough to recant? After The New Yorker’s remarkable recent profile quoted him as “ready to die”—depicting a mentally dexterous, physically frail ascetic “confined to barracks” in Los Angeles, solemnly tidying his affairs—Cohen took pains to console his fans, with familiar drollness: “I’ve always been into self-dramatization. I intend to live forever.” But even as he demurs, it’s hard not to play his 14th studio album, You Want It Darker, and hear a pristine, piously crafted last testament—a courtly act of finality that extends to the title. (Notice it’s not a question; it’s a prescription.)Cohen has always kicked up his heels in the ambiguities of love and spirituality—casting prayers to the carnal, getting off on enlightenment. And so this new darkness he offers has dimensions instead of declaratives—it feels, in turn, to lyrically reference the encroaching blackness of death, the insularity of plumbing the soul ever-deeper, a fresh fatalism toward the spinning world. “I’m leaving the table\\/I’m out of the game\\/I don’t know the people\\/In your picture frame,” he laments, achingly, on “Leaving the Table,” over a warm and minimal waltz. Later, he intones, “I’m traveling light\\/It’s au revoir\\/My once so bright\\/My fallen star” (“Traveling Light”). It’s delivered with a wink, and no more dramatically brooding than his past work, but it is inescapably morbid; every track is vivid yet still enigmatic as it conjures loss and lamentation of some variety.This darkness also apparent in the newly fathomless boom of his baritone, which already stripped the floorboards on recent albums Old Ideas and Popular Problems. Whereas the rough edges of his younger, nasal reediness suggested chic bohemian nonchalance, now his low caroling is edged in defiance, and Darker’s production is singularly complementary to it. When he imagines, not so subtly, the stars above him losing light (“If I Didn’t Have Your Love”), his intoning dips below cherubic organs, hinting at what these enamored lyrics soon reveal—that this bright devotional is of the spiritual sort, hewing closer to his past career as a monk than as an Olympic-level ladies’ man. (The most jarring thing about Darker is how utterly devoid of lust it is.) The gracious, spare production adds to the spell—contributed by his son, Adam Cohen, who almost wholly replaces his father’s proclivities for tinny keyboards and stately, gospel-esque female harmonies in favor of violins, warm acoustic guitar, and a cantor male choir. The elder Cohen’s familiar scaffolding of flamenco-influenced guitar remains, a bridge to history.Cohen is not a songwriter who panders; he speaks above us, sometimes quite literally to higher forms, but also to universality instead of common denominator. Topicality, to him, remains somewhere around the Romantic era. But Cohen is also keen to experiment here. He embraces spry, rootsy bluegrass strings on “Steer Your Way,” which nods back in a few directions—to his college stint in a country band, to 1971’s Songs of Love and Hate (which featured Charlie Daniels on fiddle), to brighter moments on Popular Problems. The album’s final track, for the first time, is a string reprise; it bows out “String Reprise\\/Treaty,” Cohen’s difficult conversation with his higher power (“I wish there was a treaty we could sign\\/It’s over now, the water and the wine\\/We were broken then, but now we’re borderline”) with delicate, mournful dignity.The album’s heart is exposed early, and plainly, in the title track. Its religious tones veer toward disdainful (“If you are the dealer\\/I’m out of the game\\/If you are the healer\\/I’m broken and lame”) but his oaky growl quickly becomes rapturous. Three times, as the choir drops out, he chants, “Hineni Hineni”—a Hebrew cry of devotion, the reply of a ready worshipper who hears their calling from God and is ready to act in service. Often, it’s the service in the afterlife. His is not a yelp of fervor, or excitable in any shade; the moment is his most quaking, sunken baritone delivery on the album—so deep, it would sound sinister without such compassion imbuing it. It’s the informed conclusion of a lifetime of inquiry. Hopefully, it is one holy dialogue of more still to come. But in this moment, he sounds satisfied; he has loved us in his own way, and he is ready for what awaits him next. But that doesn’t mean we are.\"],[22542,\"If time heals all wounds, as anybody who has ever suffered heartbreak has been reassured, that’s scant comfort when time won't move. On Male Bonding’s 2010 debut Nothing Hurts, a high watermark of the era’s fuzz-punk boom, the London trio stared at the clock, wondering when, exactly, the healing was supposed to begin. “Year’s not long,” singer\\/guitarist John Arthur Webb repeated to himself on the band’s breakthrough song, unconvincingly—because in the wake of trauma, a year is an eternity. On the band’s fuming third album Headache, Webb stops straining to find a bright side and just leans into the misery. Opener “Wrench” begins by laying out the kind of worst-case scenario that even the most dejected scorned lovers try to resist considering: What if 15 years pass and you still don’t feel any fucking better about things?  It’s been five years since Male Bonding’s last album, Endless Nothing, though it just as well could have been 15, given how off the radar they’ve been lately. At some point after that record, they split from Sub Pop, the label that aided their swift rise, and ceased touring. Their social media accounts sat dark for more than a year before they surprise-released Headache, and at this point even its existence does little to clarify whether they have or haven’t broken up. Releasing a new album for free, with no promotion or any live shows to support it, is the type of thing a band does when they’re over. The no-frills Facebook post announcing the record reads like a farewell note: “Have our third album for free—see ya.”  Was another Male Bonding record necessary after all these years? The band’s debut so effectively laid out their formula—fizzy hooks, neurotic tempos, 1990 production values—that there wasn’t much room to improve on it. Endless Nothing faced the same burden justifying itself, too, and good as it was, that album didn’t add much to their legacy, either. But then again, in the post-No Age age, where this kind of purist noise-rock generates a fraction of the interest it did just a half decade ago, Male Bonding have fallen so far from the public consciousness that they barely have a legacy to protect. There was nothing to lose by giving it another stab.   Perhaps the best thing about Headache, then, is the reminder that this band even existed in the first place, but the album stands on its own merits, too. Since the band once touted the youthful fallacy that nothing ever changes, there’s a curious poignance in hearing how they’ve aged—and, to be sure, they have aged. They’ve grown angrier, crankier and, fittingly, grungier. The boyish harmonies of Nothing Hurts are mostly gone; the band can still turn a hook, but they aren’t nearly as sweet or nimble as the old ones. There used to be something vaguely anti-gravitational about the band’s songs, a lightness, but these tunes hang low to the ground, collecting dirt.   What hasn’t changed is the emotional charge. If anything, Webb’s conviction comes across more pointedly than ever. “Why does this keep happening? I cannot feel the way I want to feel,” he shudders over helter-skelter guitars on “What’s Wrong?” On “Chipping Away,” a sloppy, half-finished sketch of a song, he curses his writer’s block, blaming it on his inability to move on from an estranged ex, but he saves his harshest accusation for the Dinosaur Jr.-heavy “I Would Say”: “Why did you leave when I needed help?”  So on the surface, Headache is another album about wounds that won’t heal. But at its best it brings a wizened new perspective to those same themes. It’s also about growing older and, for all the wear, still feeling like yourself, something that anybody who's been shocked to discover that they connect as deeply with In Utero in their 30s as they did as a teen can relate to. Sometimes there’s comfort in feeling sad, simply because it can remind us of times when we were younger and felt the same. Judging from these cloudy songs, Webb needs all the comfort he can get. “What deserts me cannot hurt me,” he sings on the closer “Out to Sea,” but once again, he’s deluding himself. It already has.\"],[22454,\"On first glance, it’s easy to peg Savoy Motel as ’70s revivalists. Their logo is rendered in Shotgun font like the title card on some Saturday morning kids’ show; the Lichtenstein-style pop-art graphic of their debut album resembles a bargain-bin K-Tel comp of disco hits. And in their videos, the Nashville quartet come off as a cross between the Partridge family and Manson family, all vintage thrift-store duds and hypnotic blank stares. But on this first full-length, Savoy Motel aren’t so much recreating a moment from 40 years ago as heralding the 20-year nostalgia cycle for 20-year nostalgia cycles. They render the sounds of the ’70s using the ’90s pastiche techniques of Beck, Ween, and Royal Trux, compacting glam-rock, southern boogie, and Stax sax stabs into 8-bit videogame proportions.Savoy Motel is something of a hybrid Tennessee garage-rock supergroup: bassist\\/vocalist Jeffrey Novak and drummer Jessica McFarland played together in raucous power-pop outfit Cheap Time; guitarists Dillon Watson and Mimi Galbierz slathered the fuzz on thick in Heavy Cream. But that in-the-red ethos is barely perceptible here—the wild abandon of their previous groups has been harnessed into vacuum-sealed pawn-shop pop is capable of inciting spontaneous line-dancing. The fetching first song on their debut doubles as Savoy Motel’s mission-statement slogan. With its staccato faux-brass jabs and cheerfully chintzy psych-funk groove, “Souvenir Shop Rock” does to ’70s pop signifiers what a snowglobe does to a city skyline: it both miniaturizes and exaggerates its features, closing itself off from the real world to create its own make-believe wonderland.But in Savoy Motel’s case, the music’s hermetic dimensions amplify the bustling activity within them: the call-and-response interplay between singer Novak’s louche delivery and Galbierz and McFarland’s stoner-soul harmonies; the squelching sci-fi synths and drum-machine tics; and the squealing leads of Watson, a disciple from the Neil Hagerty school of avant-shredding. And while they shamelessly draw from the past, they shrewdly rearrange their source elements into curious combinations: “Doctor Cook” swaps out Marc Bolan’s top hat for a Stetson; “Mindless Blues” is Can’s “Halleluwah” if Damo Suzuki got elbowed out by ESG.However, Savoy Motel's clever record-collector references and kitschy lo-tech dressing ultimately play supporting roles to the insidious, interlocking hooks and seductive swagger of songs like “Sorry People,” “Everyone Wants to Win,” and “Hot One.” Tellingly, the one concerted effort to unravel their tightly coiled aesthetic—on the nine-minute, maggot-brained slow jam “International Language”—proves to be the album’s least compelling moment, exposing the limitations of trying to go widescreen on a Super-8 budget. But while that track indulges Savoy Motel’s latent epic ambitions, the true charm of this record lies in the way it craftily retrofits the sound of ’70s excess for our age of austerity.\"],[22436,\"The third album from Chicago trio Oozing Wound begins with a backwards guitar wail that puts a fresh twist on the technique Metallica used in the iconic intro to their ...And Justice for All leadoff track “Blackened.” True to form, of course, the prelude gives way to a muscular, uptempo chug as the song, “Rambo 5 (Pre-Emptive Strike)” achieves liftoff, announcing that “okay, now we’re really getting shit started” in stereotypical metal fashion. More importantly, on “Rambo 5” Oozing Wound manage to recapture the energy of classic Slayer, Left Hand Path-era Entombed, and skate punk-rooted metal like Suicidal Tendencies and Excel all in the same riff.In purely musical terms, Whatever Forever is bound to attract thrash, stoner rock, doom, and punk loyalists as well as people arriving at those particular strains of heaviness for the first time. Metalheads will no doubt recognize how frontman\\/guitarist Zack Weil howls like a cross between Exodus vocalist Steve “Zetro” Souza and Kreator’s Mille Petrozza. Likewise, now-departed drummer Kyle Reynolds’ fills and thumpa-thumpa-thumpa beats recall genre luminaries like Dave Lombardo and Charlie Benante. By the same token, though, Oozing Wound exude an attitude that immediately distinguishes them from the music they reference—and update—with such convincing skill.Oozing Wound play with undeniable passion. They also shift gears between tempos with uncanny ease, and their ability to incorporate slower sections gives the faster material an explosiveness it wouldn't otherwise have. As the lava-like churn of “Eruptor” bubbles to a boil and segues into “Tachycardia,” for example, Oozing Wound not only channel High on Fire at their most infernal but also manage to sustain the buildup over both songs. Additionally, engineer Matt Russell’s rendering of bassist Kevin Cribbin’s tone should serve as the ultimate reference for how to capture low end that’s Godzilla-huge—full and imposing, but most of all clear.All that said, it’s hard to listen to this album and not get the feeling that these guys are making fun of their influences while also honoring them. Despondency, hopelessness, and even outright nihilism can certainly make for engaging music. But when those emotions are worn on the sleeve as affectations, they ring hollow. With Oozing Wound, it’s hard to tell. On their own, the lyrics on Whatever Forever contain vague but nevertheless thought-provoking undercurrents. When Weil sings that “peace is a lie” and that “tonight we will track, and identify spies” on “Rambo 5,” one gets the distinct sense he might be talking about more than the outward silliness that the song title lets on. The same goes for Weil’s lyrics on “Mercury in Retrograde Virus,” where he sings “Conscious killing keeps the planet spinning...\\/Can’t fight that kind of breeding\\/The facts a mask revealing.” But Weil also plays up a fuck-it-all malaise that comes off as a posture and begs you not to care about what he’s saying. As he sneers his way through self-defeatist headbanger anthems like “Diver” and “Everything Sucks, and My Life Is a Lie,” the band’s raucous delivery sounds better suited for the upbeat mood of keg party. On paper, the contrast should make for rich juxtaposition. Instead, Weil and company end up looking like they lack the courage of their convictions.Oozing Wound deserve credit for standing apart from purist thrash revivalists like Bonded by Blood and Mantic Ritual. Clearly, they intend for their music to serve as a beefier, decidedly modern take on classic forms. But by hiding behind detachment, the music's underlying power ends up getting smothered by its bluster. As engaging as that bluster is at first, over the course of ten songs Whatever Forever begins to grate not unlike a person who tries too hard to look nonchalant when they would hold your attention longer if they just opened up a bit more.\"],[22377,\"Sometimes you just gotta go straight to the elevator pitch: what if the xx came up on American Football instead of Aaliyah? Though his post-production methods put him within the scope of downtempo, monastic R&B, Joey Vannucchi uses the compositional tools of twinkly, technical emo—clean guitar figures criss-crossed in askew time signatures, hopscotching drum rhythms, hushed vocals piecing together desires for someone always out of the frame. It’s hard to tell where the meticulous mood-setting of one format begins and the other ends, but you’ve got 68 minutes on From Indian Lakes’ fourth LP to figure it out: this is Vannucchi’s sound and he doesn’t deviate much from it.While “the first math rock make-out album” is certainly a novel concept, it’s no gimmick; the singular aesthetic here has been in development for the better part of a decade. The first biographical nugget often told of Vannucchi is that he grew up in isolation and without electricity on a 40-acre parcel of land near Yosemite National Park. There wasn’t much to do besides obsess over music and play drums in a church basement, so it makes sense that his first two self-recorded and self-released albums drew from formative listening staples like Radiohead, but also Death Cab for Cutie and quasi-Christian alternative acts like Copeland, As Tall as Lions, and Lydia that once filled the midsection on Bamboozle festival posters.Vannucchi’s upbringing makes for a nice story, though From Indian Lakes’ trajectory should be quite familiar to rock fans this point: band from far outside a major media center, too introspective and ambitious to be pigeonholed in pop-punk, finds an audience alienated by both the juvenilia of Warped Tour and painful curation of cool that defined mainstream indie. This is basically how the emo revival happened, and by 2014’s Absent Sounds, From Indian Lakes had signed to Triple Crown, now the home of Into It. Over It., You Blew It!, Sorority Noise and Foxing, bands representative of the current day’s more thoughtful and enlightened popular emo.This trajectory has coincided with Vannucchi shearing off every conceivable marker of his alt-rock beginnings until there’s nothing left but the pretty stuff. The blushing fauna gracing the album cover has become a familiar sight in emo’s ongoing progressive, pastoral phase, but nothing has truly embodied humidified, aural verdancy like Everything Feels Better Now. Though Vannucchi’s arrangements are intricately crafted, every sound gets subjected to a unifying greenhouse effect, distorted guitars, vibraphones, panning effects and tremolo shudders all becoming soft, yielding textures drooping into each other.If it’s dream-pop, the emphasis is exceedingly towards the former; though Vannucchi’s bashful, beatific hooks bring “Blank Tapes” and “Happy Machines” to tidal crests, nothing really peaks or crashes. The reverie is only broken up when Vannucchi tries to deliver a message and falls back on stock metaphors for the impotence of nostalgia (“Blank Tapes”), indignity of public performance (“It’s my soul you want and a cage for me”), inner demons (“The Monster”) and American dreams (“American Dreams”).  But if Vannucchi’s guileless lyricism can occasionally lapse into diaristic angst, it’s also responsible for the simple, lovelorn ache that defines Everything Feels Better Now and distances it from the burlier entrants in the scene’s soft parade, as well as the Bed, Bath and Body Works of Washed Out or Rhye which it superficially resembles at times. Vannucchi is unquestionably a mash note writer—“when you need to feel someone lying next to you, I can be the one” is a typical sentiment and one that would be cloying if the music didn’t back it up with such welcoming, plush ambience. “I think I’m ready to lose myself in your love,” Vannucchi coos. Fittingly, it takes him until the eleventh track to get to that point. It’s mood music for the hopeless romantic, overwhelmed by the desire to connect but pining for the confidence to make the first move.\"],[22291,\"The Ramones’ debut 1976 album was a perfect, explosive introduction. The Queens band stripped rock‘n’roll back to the studs with powerful, fucked up songs about huffing glue, Nazis falling in love, and bat fights. It didn’t chart well in the U.S., but they had a cult following, and when they toured England, Johnny Rotten and Joe Strummer showed up. Two more classics followed: Leave Home and Rocket to Russia. With just three albums, the Ramones canon was strong and their formula was unwavering. This was punk's ground zero.Then, Tommy Ramone resigned as the band’s drummer—life on the road wasn’t treating him well—and decided to do what he did best: produce Ramones albums. With Marky Ramone behind the kit and Tommy behind the boards, they made 1978’s Road to Ruin. For all its high points, it was their weakest effort and biggest commercial flop to date. Contemporaries like the Talking Heads and the Clash were about to reach new heights; the Ramones decided that a change was in order. For 1980’s End of the Century, they dumped Tommy—their guiding hand in the studio since day one—and hired Phil Spector.Consider that for a minute—the beacons of rock‘n’roll restraint hired the “wall of sound, little symphonies for the kids” wildcard. Marky Ramone described the producer rolling up to his hotel room with a cape, bodyguard, bottle of kosher wine, and unprompted tirade about the 1966 death of Lenny Bruce. He was an untethered, erratic, odd man, and that’s sugarcoating it heavily. This was the same Phil Spector who kept Ronnie Spector locked in a closet, shot a bullet into the ceiling of John Lennon’s studio, and held a gun to Leonard Cohen’s neck.It’s amazing to think that anyone would hire him at that point, but they had their reasons: Sales were slipping, Spector persistently offered his services, and their label was willing to pay the legend’s rate. If the Ramones were interested in becoming more popular, why not roll the dice with a guy who made “Be My Baby” and “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling”?After he reached his creative and commercial peak in the ’60s, Spector briefly left the business when Ike & Tina Turner’s “River Deep —Mountain High” failed to become a bigger hit. He returned to the game at the request of the Beatles. He was responsible for finishing up Let It Be (to the disdain of Paul McCartney) and co-produced two of the best solo Beatles albums: Plastic Ono Band and All Things Must Pass. There was the aforementioned fraught Leonard Cohen album Death of a Ladies’ Man. His other projects, with their huge production value, weren’t all that visible—records with Cher (including a Nilsson collaboration), Dion, Ronnie Spector, and Darlene Love. Given his penchant for schmaltz, there was no reason to expect Spector to show interest in punk. But at the urging of close friends Dan and David Kessel (sons of Wrecking Crew legend Barney Kessel and fans of L.A.’s punk scene), Phil saw the Ramones at the Whisky a Go Go in 1977. Every time the Ramones came through L.A. after that, he’d attend their shows, meet them, and give them the same line: “Do you guys wanna be great or good? ‘Cause I’ll make you great.”Spector’s infatuation with the band definitely made sense. The Ramones were loud, back to basics rock‘n’roll in an era of disco, yacht rock, prog, the Eagles, Journey, Boston, and Kansas. Their song structures were simple and the harmonies were there. Early ’60s pop was a key part of the band’s DNA—some of their first covers were “California Sun,” “Let’s Dance,” and “Surfin’ Bird.” It was gnarly music unafraid of being pretty, and while their nuts-and-bolts songs appealed to Spector, he also loved how irreverent they were. (For reference, ctrl+F the word “fuck” in Spector’s 1969 interview with Rolling Stone—dude had a filthy mouth.)While Marky Ramone described Spector as a drinking buddy and friend, his bandmates had a far more acrimonious relationship with the producer. Dee Dee and Phil hated each other. The bassist and songwriter was taking lots of sedatives at the time, which may have contributed to his paranoia about Spector’s guns. In his memoir, he told a story about Phil pointing a gun at his heart before forcing the band to stay all night at his house while he sang them “Baby, I Love You.” Marky would later deny stories about the Ramones being threatened or held hostage by Spector, though Dee Dee always remained firm in his account. The drummer confirmed that multiple guns were present throughout the recording process: Spector apparently carried four on his person at any given moment, which doesn’t include what his bodyguards had on them or the turrets mounted to his house.Johnny, the band’s general who instituted fines for lateness, was not a fan of Spector’s studio perfectionism and verbal abuse. One of the most famous scenes from the album’s sessions transpired when Spector forced Johnny to play the opening chord of “Rock‘n’Roll High School” repeatedly for hours on end. It was an attempt to get the same sustained chord effect from the “Hard Day’s Night” intro, and it was taking forever. This band was used to bashing out albums quickly, and now, they were being asked to draw everything out—to ponder the resonance of every chord. At some point, after appearing to grow increasingly agitated with Johnny’s performance, the producer started laying all of his guns out on a table in the studio. “After he shot that girl, I thought, ‘I’m surprised he didn’t shoot someone every year,’” wrote Johnny.Joey was clearly the reason why Spector wanted to work with the band at all. Phil loved Joey. The first time Phil met the gangly frontman, he showered him with praise, calling his voice “one in a million.” David Kessel hypothesized that the two hit it off over rock history and their common “New York street-corner” upbringing. Spector would refer to the band as “Joey and the Ramones,” which obviously irked Johnny (who especially hated the producer saying “it’s all you, Joey”). There were private, late night vocal coaching sessions, and at least two different people present for their interactions claimed that Phil saw Joey as “a male Ronnie Spector.” It’s hard to fathom what that means, especially considering Phil’s horrific relationship with Ronnie, but that vague insight helps explain why Joey ended up singing one of the most famous Ronettes songs.Even with a full understanding of End of the Century’s context, “Baby, I Love You” is jarring. Coming directly off the scorched earth “fight for fun” mercenary basher “Let’s Go,” the B-side of the record opens with this lavish, white gloves string section. Joey’s voice teases, pouts, and pleads; everything feels saccharine. The Ramones had tons of success with ballads in the past. “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend,” for example—Johnny’s guitar sound was still tough, and Joey’s performance, while sweet, was stiff. Now, assisted by Spector’s wall of sound arrangements and hours of vocal coaching, Joey was singing his heart out—hitting high notes and emoting broadly. No other Ramones appear on the track, which means there’s no Johnny Ramone guitar crunch or nearly-flat Dee Dee Ramone harmonies to offset Joey. It’s all billowing, pillowy softness: wedding music.It’s the most plain example of Spector’s influence over the band’s sound, and it illustrates his narrow understanding of what made the Ramones great. Yes, Joey Ramone was a treasure whose instrument was unrivaled, and in that sense, Spector was right to try and pull out the best performance from the singer. But his focus on Joey seemed to undercut how he approached the rest of the band, who were readily swapped out with session players. “To this day, I still have no idea how they made the album End of the Century or who actually played bass on it,” Dee Dee quipped in his book. Several times throughout the record, songs are forced to face the bar set by previous versions. Spector’s “Rock‘n’Roll High School” lives in the shadow of the original Ed Stasium version from the film. Next to the comparably crisp, direct original, Spector’s wall of sound vocal recordings gives the track a soupy, echoing effect—not the ideal soundtrack for Riff Randall blowing up her school. Then, in a move highlighting the band’s status as students of the game, they wrote sequels to Ramones songs. (There are several precedents in rock history for the sequel song: Buddy Holly’s Peggy Sue got married, Lesley Gore got her revenge on Judy, Chubby Checker twisted again like we did last summer, and so forth.) “The Return of Jackie and Judy” is a subpar Ramones song that continues the narrative of a great Ramones song. The same thing happens on “This Ain’t Havana,” which is a goofy, worse flip of “Havana Affair” that’s built around Joey singing the word “banana.”The Dee Dee and Richard Hell-penned “Chinese Rock” was already recorded, masterfully, by Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers in 1977. Early on, Dee Dee’s bandmates rejected the song because they wanted to avoid recording more drug songs. (This begs the question: Why draw the line at Carbona, glue, and daddy’s dope?) When they were picking out songs for End of the Century, the Ramones came around on the song, which makes sense—it’s one of Dee Dee’s best. It’s easily the best example of the band’s old instincts kicking in, as the End of the Century version is faster, heavier, and more frantic than the Heartbreakers’ original. Frantic is a good look for “Chinese Rock,” especially because “everything is in the pawn shop” is a perfect line about living in junkie squalor.The narrative about End of the Century is convenient if you just look at “Baby, I Love You” and “Chinese Rock”—that the ballads are lousy and the aggressive punk songs rule. It’s not that simple. “Danny Says” is the best song on the album and maybe one of the best ballads in Ramones history. It’s a gentle, beautifully performed song where Joey complains about touring. The thrill of meeting fans at record stores and hearing their songs on the radio is nothing compared to having a full day off. This is the exact zone where the Ramones work best—where sentimentality is cut with cynicism and where Joey’s cooing vocals are met with Johnny’s beefy guitar. Spector labored for about six months on the album’s mixing, and right to the very end, he was drunk and abusive. Some of his work paid off, with songs like “Do You Remember Rock‘n’Roll Radio?” sounding appropriately enormous and triumphant with its sax skronk, radio announcer, and pulsing organ. Elsewhere, it seems like he was just overthinking it, and in the process, undermining a lot of what made the band powerful to begin with. Throughout “I’m Affected,” there are these big, thunderous drum fills that momentarily eclipse everything else. Where a few chords from Johnny could break up the melody and move the song forward with power and authority, Phil instead opts for a big production moment that swallows the band’s guitar sound. It’s a detail, but one that makes an otherwise powerful band sound feeble.The Ramones had worked longer and harder on End of the Century than any album before it. They dealt with Spector’s fits, drunken rage, and firearms. Aside from Marky, the band wasn’t excited about the final product. Johnny hated “Baby, I Love You” and talked about how embarrassed he was by the song. The album technically did its intended job—it charted higher than any Ramones record that had come before it. Granted, it peaked at No. 44 and was outshone on the charts by the band's peers (the Clash’s London Calling, Blondie’s Eat to the Beat, etc.) The album also marked Spector's unofficial retirement; he would stop working in the studio pretty much altogether after the death of John Lennon. His final production credits came on a 2003 Starsailor album, and that same year, he was arrested on suspicion of Lana Clarkson’s murder. He went to prison in 2009. Marky Ramone made an appearance in the courtroom to support his old friend.It’s a record that sits at an interesting crossroads—the post-Tommy Ramones seeking the guidance of an almost-retired, wildly unpredictable, potentially dangerous Phil Spector. The result is a disorienting album with broad jumps in quality and tone from song to song. Where the first Ramones albums could shift seamlessly from ballad to banger (from “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend” to “Chain Saw”), End of the Century never seems to find its connective tissue. It had some of the Ramones' flimsiest songs, and too often, key Ramones weren’t involved in their creation.On “Do You Remember Rock‘n’Roll Radio,” Joey seems to summarize his conversations with Spector—a song about how good rock music used to be. This conceit is where the Ramones lose the narrative. On early efforts, they condensed “California Sun” into a punk rock blast—using the language of the past to create something contemporary and vital. Their cover of “Baby, I Love You” is a museum piece—a pound-for-pound attempt to relive Spector’s golden years. The Ramones even romanticize old Ramones songs, revisiting their own mythology instead of carving out new narratives. “It’s the end, the end of the ’70s,” sang Joey. The Ramones lamented the end of their most unstoppable era, and then they refused to move forward.\"],[22378,\"Jim Adkins had written himself off. Judging from the open letter announcing Integrity Blues, the Jimmy Eat World frontman had spent the band’s first-ever hiatus soul-searching. For 15 years, Jimmy Eat World had been judged against their self-help smash hit “The Middle,” and this past April, Taylor Swift gave it a signal boost with an uncomfortably mixed message: “I used to listen to this in middle school!”  The expansive, emotionally weathered Integrity Blues sounds nothing like “The Middle,” but it’s perhaps their best record since then on account of being its unlikely spiritual sequel.It does feel odd praising Adkins for taking the initiative to actually write about himself, given Jimmy Eat World’s status to many as emo’s quintessential band. But unlike the other songwriters responsible for breaking emo onto alt-rock radio in early ’00s, Adkins never created a persona that made him inextricable from his music, allowing the audience rather than the author to inhabit the role of the narrator—this is why Clarity and Bleed American have aged much better than unearthed LiveJournals like The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most or Deja Entendu. But after Bleed American redeemed Jimmy Eat World commercially, their albums have been increasingly self-conscious and reactionary: the blue-black millennial malaise of Futures led to the peacocking radio-rock of Chase This Light; the band reunited with Clarity and Bleed American producer\\/donut innovator Mark Trombino for Invented, an ambitious and uneven collection of character sketches inspired by Cindy Sherman and Hannah Starkey photography. It led to another precipitous drop in sales and was followed by the streamlined Damage, pitched as an “adult breakup record,” but sounding complacent and AOR enough to soundtrack a date night movie at AMC Cinema.Their new partnership with Justin Meldal-Johnsen on Integrity Blues is both sensible and inspired: he’s worked on recent records for Paramore and Tegan and Sara, acts with emo foundations who are unrepentantly making rewarding pop now and Jimmy Eat World is as much a pop act as Carly Rae Jepsen is emo. Meldal-Johnsen is perhaps best known as the producer and bassist for M83—a band that sounds little like Jimmy Eat World, but still uses “can you still feel the butterflies” as an operating artistic principle, creating fantastical safe spaces in which teenage melodrama is a life-sustaining renewable resource rather than an escape.At least from a production standpoint, Integrity Blues is the exact opposite of what the title promises: it’s a complete fabrication of a four-person rock band, a proudly produced record where barely anything sounds like it does in its natural state. The guitar that opens “You With Me” is almost comically opulent, like a harp strung with liquid crystal and wrapped in icicle lights. Falsetto harmonies channel an ultralight beam through stained glass, sounding closer to the synth-prog hosannahs of Mew or Passion Pit. Every element of Zach Lind’s drum set is tweaked with crackling EQ and Rick Burch’s bass is a pulsating synth bubble. And yet the modesty that would often dulled and sanitized Chase This Light and Damage provides necessary heft on Integrity Blues. “You With Me” still feels like four guys in a room.Integrity Blues is in the exquisite, crystalline mold of “Polaris” or “Ten” and they’ve never successfully spent the majority of any album in this mode until now. The rumbling exposition of “Sure and Certain” and its choral liftoff nods back at professed superfans Chvrches, “It Matters” is unusually slinky and guitar-free, “Pretty Grids” is damn near translucent. Elsewhere, they prove deft and evoking their past glory without rehashing it: actual adult breakup ballad “The End Is Beautiful” is a crossbreed of “Hear You Me” and“Cautioners,” and Jimmy Eat World can still write spring-loaded, major-third melodies (“Through”) and add to their flawless run of 6+-minute epics (closer “Pol Roger” is “23”going on 40). The deceptively worded “You With Me” (“what makes our love so hard to be\\/is it you or is that you with me?”) is also indicative of Adkins’ subtle and progressive growth as a lyricist. Freed from the narrative strictures that Damage and Invented couldn’t support, Integrity Blues unpacks an adulthood spent “destination addicted,” whether the arrival is financial, romantic or even emotional success. At times, it’s almost like he’s ripping up the lyric sheets of his past—20 years after “Episode IV” promised a chance to dance all night, Adkins sneers, “But that’s something we never do...there’s my dream, doesn’t that sound good to you?” “Our weakness is the same, we need poison sometimes,” went the refrain on Clarity’s intoxicating “Ten”; Integrity Blues' frostbitten title track declares, “no one’s making you spend lonely nights poisoned through and through.” Even in his less resolute days, Adkins was always a try-hard type, and and his new bootstraps mentality can aggravate that impulse: the thematically impenetrable “Pass the Baby” creeps from a monotone, no-fi electronic lurch to math-rock pummeling, a reminder that Adkins once branded himself a Jesus Lizard ripoff artist and proof that menace and obscurity are the opposite of what they’re good at. Lead single “Get Right” serves as Integrity Blues’ thesis (“disguised as patience, time gets wasted”), but it's probably the least compelling Jimmy Eat World single ever released.It’s immediately followed by one of their best; “You Are Free” is earnest and comforting, on the edge of cloying, and unabashedly anthemic—like all of Jimmy Eat World’s best songs, it tells you what you need to hear right when you’re vulnerable enough to hear it. “Amazing the emotional bridges, tunnels, roads and ways we go around what’s one step from our face,” Adkins sings. “You Are Free” echoes the sentiments of “The Middle,” but not its belief that “everything will be alright”—it can be, if you’re willing to accept your responsibility.Though Jimmy Eat World hasn’t had much part in the ongoing renaissance of emo—in fact, some of it may be a reaction to what Bleed American hath wrought—Integrity Blues finds itself sharing its dominant concern of using the genre’s inherent vulnerability and introspection to promote self-esteem rather than self-pity. Summarizing his view of integrity, Adkins sings, “It’s all what you do when no one cares,” on the title track, written during a brief solo tour where he played to small crowds in bars and churches in places like Billings, MT and Maquoketa, IA. It’s indicative of Integrity Blues’ diamond-cut polish that this is the rawest thing here—while Adkins is backed by tearful Sigur Rós strings, his vocals are completely unadorned, possibly even first-take. It just took some time, but we’re finally hearing what Adkins has to say for himself.  \"],[22541,\"Julien Baker was eight years old when Elliott Smith died. She’s not old enough to have experienced him as an active musician or even as a living person, which isn’t a knock against her. On Say Yes! A Tribute to Elliott Smith, she shows how a new generation of singer-songwriters are learning from his example. She renders “Ballad of Big Nothing” even breathier and more precarious than the original, a performance held together by tensile guitar licks and a grim determination. Her vocals are more expressive than Smith’s precise deadpan, a bit more conventionally soulful when she twirls her notes or adds some soft whooo’s toward the end. When he sang the chorus—“You can do what you want to whenever you want to”—it sounded like an accusation. When Baker sings those words, they sound more like a consolation, revealing the existential horror in such freedom.Baker, at 21, is the youngest artist on Say Yes!; the oldest, J Mascis, is 51. That range of ages is one of the more intriguing aspects of this otherwise by-the-numbers tribute album, which is just as scattershot and inconsistent as any other tribute album. It does, however, suggest a legacy that is still evolving and developing from one generation to the next. Smith’s contemporaries tend toward more faithful renditions, with mixed results. Tanya Donelly can’t find anything new to do with “Between the Bars,” but it’s not quite as redundant as Adam Franklin’s “Oh Well, Okay.” For many listeners, “Needle in the Hay” may always soundtrack Richie Tenenbaum’s suicide attempt, but Juliana Hatfield takes the song outside the house and into the city. She adds a low-key drum loop and a harmonium that evokes heavy traffic and dense, pressing crowds, which lets a bit of air into the song without alleviating its dire anxieties.We know what Smith meant to his contemporaries, but what does he mean to younger musicians who discovered him only after he took his life, after his legacy had cemented, after his albums had been elevated to the status of classics? Some of the most compelling interpretations on Say Yes! come from the younger artists, who have the benefit of some distance on the subject. The Nashville duo Escondido reinvent “Waltz #1” as a shoegaze pop anthem, drenching it in hazy reverb broken only by Jessica Maros’ surface-to-air vocals. It’s refreshingly over the top—a maximalist rendering of a minimalist song. Taking a different tack, Waxahatchee slows “Angeles” down to an even slower crawl, her only accompaniment a heartbeat drum and a guitar that would be hypnotic if it weren’t so discordant and unsettling. More than the music, it’s the vocals that lend the cover its sense of dread. Katie Crutchfield sings with a subtle sneer in her voice, twisting her vowels into a grimace that amplifies the grim, gray humor at the song’s core.Elliott Smith is, ultimately, not especially easy to cover. His precise melodies make a deep and immediate impression, as do his fatalistic lyrics, but they’re never simply gloomy. His best songs possess some grain of humor—a dark, wincing humor that often bubbles to the surface in sarcastic asides. Walking the fine line between so many gradations of emotion can be tricky, and there are more missed opportunities on Say Yes! than revealing interpretations.So it’s surprising that one of the standouts comes from one of the unlikeliest sources: Amanda Palmer has not exactly endeared herself to the music world, which makes her choice of songs so ideal. She turns “Pictures of Me” into a meditation on celebrity and a vertiginous rift between a woman’s public and private selves. “I’m so sick and tired of all these pictures of me, completely wrong, totally wrong,” she sings, her voice low but tense, as though barely suppressing her rage. She grits her teeth and pounds her piano violently, turning the song into a great fuck-you to the entire Internet. It doesn’t make her more sympathetic, but that’s not the point. In Smith she finds something like a kindred spirit, and in “Pictures” she finds a song that speaks for her. That’s why we all listen in the first place, right?\"],[22503,\"Meshuggah’s first album in four years begins with a hushed one-two-three-four hi-hat count courtesy of drummer Tomas Haake. Unless you’re listening on headphones, you’re likely to miss it—the first subtle-but-tangible indicator of the human element Meshuggah made a conscious effort to recapture this time out. Although the veteran metal quintet sounded newly invigorated on its last two albums, 2008’s obZen and 2012’s Koloss, The Violent Sleep of Reason is easily the most organic-sounding Meshuggah album in over 20 years.For the first time since the 1994 EP None, Meshuggah opted to record as a band, tracking all guitars, bass, and drums more or less simultaneously. For proper perspective on the significance of this decision, one has to understand how comically anal-retentive Meshuggah’s writing and recording process had become. For the majority of the band’s catalog, each member has worked separately at computer work stations located in adjacent rooms in the studio. Of course, that approach weighted the focus towards digital editing and composition while band chemistry took a backseat. Over time, it even became customary for Meshuggah to enter the studio without having rehearsed, and with each member hearing the other members’ songs for the first time. Given the heightened energy of the last two albums, one would expect the shift to a traditional recording approach to pay off on Violent Sleep. Metal bands, alas, inevitably lose vitality as they age. Which means that Meshuggah are unlikely to ever match the unbridled thrashing passion of classic titles like 1995’s Destroy Erase Improve and 1998’s Chaosphere. They manage to come close this time—at least in spots. On second track “Born in Dissonance,” for example, Meshuggah bring the song’s galloping groove to life so convincingly that it’s virtually impossible to listen without doing something physical—pumping your fist, banging your head, getting behind the wheel of a car. Unfortunately, “Dissonance” is one of only two songs on the whole album that are built out of driving grooves. The rest of Violent Sleep bears more of a resemblance to the stiff, plodding material on Meshuggah’s middle-period albums, 2002’s Nothing and 2005’s Catch Thirtythree. After an encouraging start, Violent Sleep begins to get mired in tentative rhythms that hover and even grate rather than achieve the kind of acceleration that Meshuggah excel at when they choose to pick up the pace. At times, the bare-bones immediacy of the production even clashes with the downtempo vibe of the songs, some of which could have benefited from more of obZen’s ambience. Haake, the band's chief lyricist, avoids explicit references to terrorism or religious fanaticism. But one doesn't have to read far between the lines to discern the contempt behind a staunchly atheistic song like “Stifled”—or to locate its context in current events when vocalist Jens Kidman barks about “Your self-avowed murderous God...\\/Your commands unheard underground\\/Where your voice will never resonate...\\/Your sleep no longer impermanent\\/Decaying matter now sums you up\\/Like all the lives you’ve taken\\/Now so are you retreating to dust.”Haake’s point (and point of view) remains vague throughout the album. But the album title positions humanity at a point of collective spasm, as if “reason” and the forces that oppose it—blind religious fervor, most obviously—continue to lock in a deadly contest that leaves mass casualties in its wake.  The Violent Sleep of Reason galvanizes most when Meshuggah rise to the challenge of writing music that matches the urgency and global scope of its subjects. All too often, though, even as they’re captured playing together in a room for the first time in ages, Meshuggah sound a tad more comfortable than agitated. \"],[22479,\"The first thing you’ll notice about Axis: Sova’s Motor Earth is a curious juxtaposition: the sound of a full-fledged psych-rock band playing alongside a tinny drum machine—raw, arena-sized power paired with pint-sized snares and kicks. The sonic contrast wasn’t always so conspicuous. Last year’s Early Surf relied on a drum machine too, but the record was an experimental solo affair—frontman Brett Sova wailing away on his fuzz-damaged guitar as he wandered through a handful of hazy, half-formed ideas laid down on a Tascam 8-track cassette recorder. Amid all that lo-fi murk, the drum machine made sense: just something to keep time while Sova futzed around with his guitar pedals. For Motor Earth—Axis’ second album for Ty Segall’s Drag City imprint God? Records—Sova assembled an actual band, including touring buddies Tim Kaiser on guitar and Tyson Thurston on bass, and significantly improved the production quality, ditching tape hiss for a sharper, beefier sound. Sova also turned in a batch of more or less identifiable verse-chorus pop songs; the band’s unremitting racket now makes room for a few solid hooks. Even Sova’s voice, largely an afterthought on Early Surf, has emerged as a real melodic weapon.  So why not get a proper drummer? It’s a valid question, and yet it overlooks the Chicago band’s primary appeal (at least in its current iteration): mechanized, unthinking propulsion—an attribute that rock bands, guitar-based and not, have used to great effect over the decades, from Suicide to the Kills. And anyway, Axis: Sova with a regular kit would be just another Hawkwind nostalgia band. Sova thinks his greatest asset is his beloved ’73 Telecaster, but it’s that Roland Rhythm Arranger pulsing underneath. Which is not to say that he’s a slouch with a wah-wah pedal—Sova didn’t name his band after Hendrix’s Axis: Bold As Love for nothing. He and Kaiser have a hell of a good time on opener “Love Identity,” tag teaming on glammed-out T. Rex riffage and molten Sonic Youth klang for a fever-dreamy eight minutes. Motor Earth never tops that track’s ebullient first few minutes—listening to Early Surf, who would have ever thought you could sing along to these guys?—but they certainly try. “Violent Yellow” packs an album’s worth of guitar moves into a hot little mess of teenage paranoia and lust. And “(Like an) Intruder” is the record’s most giddily propulsive moment: the Stooges riding shotgun on a Suicide track. “Treat me like an intruder,” Sova begs, in a clear homage to Iggy Pop’s indelible line: “Now I wanna be your dog.”  There’s a flip side to Sova and Kaiser’s six-string obsession: Motor Earth is one of the few guitar-nerd records in recent memory that would be better served with the instruments set lower in the mix. The guitars so dominate the rhythm section that it sometimes sounds like Sova and Kaiser are playing along to a Roland drum machine app on an iPad. Maybe unavoidably, Motor Earth is a one-note affair. Axis plug in and ride the scuzz-rock train for an unwavering 41 minutes. When the band wants to change things up, they simply ditch the pretense of songwriting altogether, drench the proceedings in acid feedback, and keep the train roaring down the track.And yet the record’s pleasures are no less potent for their blunt simplicity. Listening to closer “Routine Machine” you get the uncanny sensation that Sova and co. wrote the song in real time as they recorded it. As if the boys simply pressed play on the drum machine, grabbed their guitars, picked out a Sabbath riff or two, and kept layering vocal melodies on top of each other until everything fell into place—or fell gloriously apart, depending on your point of view.\"],[22522,\"Prison can change anyone. Enough time isolated from the world, treated as subhuman and discarded like garbage is soul-breaking and creatively stifling; it would be hard for anyone to maintain sanity or balance, regardless of a strong belief that one day you’ll be back on the outside. When Gucci Mane was finally freed from the United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana back in May, it was a joyous moment for his fans but it was unclear what effect being gone since 2013 would have on the rapper and the music. Seeing his dramatic weight loss and new healthy regimen on Snapchat was a shock but a welcome one, if it meant avoiding the vices that had nearly destroyed him.  During that time in prison, the one thing that kept Gucci’s name relevant in music—beyond the success of the younger artists he had supported, like Young Thug and Migos—was the steady stream of mixtapes that were able to come out using his unreleased music. Since being freed, he’s taking over the reins and is making up for lost time with the release of Woptober, three months after his first post-prison album Everybody Looking. Woptober is more attuned to the classic Gucci Mane aesthetic than Everybody Looking; The production is colder, murkier and with heavier bass, with Gucci slinking and swimming through it with precision and clearheaded insight. Songs like “Wop” and “Hi-Five” highlight this with an icy, brooding sound; and Gucci feels perfectly at home there. Despite the newfound clearness of his voice, likely a result of those shed pounds, it still has that guttural allure. On Woptober, Gucci can be fun and playful, grimy or poignant and thoughtful and sometimes he’s all of these things at once. Woptober gets off to a great start with “Intro: Fuck 12”: the Phantom Of The Opera piano keys giving the song a ghostly, demented air while Gucci comes in strong, focused and charismatic: “I ain't never been embarrassed, I ain't never felt fear\\/I got post-traumatic stresses like I can't shed tears,” The album proceeds with this laser focus and thoughtfulness throughout. Everybody Looking, while a good record, was more celebratory, a big “welcome back” party for Gucci. Woptober goes back to the dirtier, oddball style that Gucci became successful with but this time, it’s more disciplined and perceptive. On the album’s best track “Dirty Lil N***a”, Gucci takes a moment to relate to the fictionalized street kid he’s spent the song rapping about. “The streets don't kill him, then the law gon' get him\\/Better listen to me kid, it's a fucked-up system\\/Y'all might don't feel him but I damn sure feel him\\/Cause I was just in a jail cell fucked up with him.” It’s the same avenue that Boosie has always taken—somber but not preachy or self-righteous, and it suits Gucci Mane well as a rapper who’s always been good at reaching out to young artists and understanding youth culture. The album’s first single “Bling Blaww Burr” is a much brighter affair, a club record more memorable for its infectious ad-libs than anything else. It is the stale kind of party record Gucci can make in his sleep and a Young Dolph feature can only do so much for it. “Money Machine” is boosted by a better beat and a guest appearance from Rick Ross. Woptober slogs towards the end, but it moves too quickly to feel like a chore to sit through. It has all the markings of what we’ve come to expect from Gucci’s music only this time—rather than drowning in his addictions—he’s found a way to integrate drugs and violence into his new outlook. new life outlook. It’s a great strategy and, if he plans to continue pushing music out at such an accelerated clip, it’s hopefully just a taste of what’s to come.\"],[22515,\"Moby’s thirteenth album comes packaged with a 28-page booklet, which might lead you to expect Richard Melville-Hall’s most long-winded liner-notes broadside to date. But instead of railing against the sort of hot-button issues he has addressed in releases past—Christian hypocrisy, say, or mass incarceration or factory farming—we get page after page of the man’s photography and the lowercase statement “these systems are failing” every so often atop images of graveyards, airplanes, a family with golden skin, and what might be a “Bojack Horseman”-themed pool party at Moby’s old castle in the Hollywood Hills (though he’s since downsized).These Systems Are Failing is Moby’s most furious album in twenty years, since he neatly derailed his electronic career with the righteous punk spurt of Animal Rights back in 1996. Mission of Burma covers might have befuddled ravers ready for the E rushes of “Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)” and “Go,” but it hearkened back to Moby’s own heritage, growing up a punk in New York City in the early ’80s. In circling back to shout-along raucous punk two decades and many real estate deals later though, there’s not much grist for Moby’s mill. It’s an angry album, which in this case means Moby is running drum machines through banks of distortion and sullying up every synth line with fuzz, tempered by the kind of pressurizing rhythm guitar lines redolent of Joy Division and post-punk. A drum beat not unlike “Take on Me” opens “Hey! Hey!” paired to a hornet’s nest of guitar and synth. It’s a promising enough start, if only it didn’t just nosedive into a chintzy melody that even a fist pump-along chorus of “Hey! Hey!\\/Look how they hang us out to dry” can’t resuscitate. Feverish guitar noise and club-loud toms give urgency to “Break.Doubt,” with Moby doing his best Ian Curtis deadpan, but he can’t help but fall back on facile production choices, like simply making everything louder and layering his voice so that you hear an imaginary mosh pit of fake sweaty Mobys pogoing.As long as you don’t cringe at the overused “Los Angeles” vocal sample and gospel turn by the Void Pacific Choir, the best balance Moby strikes is between the 90’s breakbeat and throwback acid line on bonus track “Almost Loved.” But no matter the song and level of outrage, Moby can’t seem to get beyond the presets that Trent Reznor outgrew around Pretty Hate Machine nor the new romantic\\/ goth vocal delivery that –regardless of the levels of distortion on his voice—always makes him sound like a dour Count Chocula.  Moby’s lyrics lash out at planetary polluters and capitalist greed, but he saves his most acute anger not for these faceless systems of power, but for those who personally embody love lost for him. He lashes out at the girl who lied to him on “And It Hurts,” the one who walked away on “Don’t Leave Me,” not to mention the one who he accuses of giving him an insufficient love that “was old and looking back” on “A Simple Love.”It may be too far along to inform Moby that the conceit of a simple love is delusional and misplaced, that any romantic break-up requires a long gaze in the mirror and not just yelling about perceived slights. Maybe this sense of hurt and mistrust would be more palatable if it were distinguishable from his rage against the machine. It’s hard to sit through lines about “Selling off heaven for a perfect hell” and corporate greed when he himself opened the floodgates. Selling every last second of an album to multiple advertising campaigns (Play), peddling bottle service-style club music as nostalgia,not to mention partnering with the same luxury hotels that now litter the city. Moby’s own rising economic fortunes mirrored that of Manhattan, so his bald embrace of “the city’s absurd cult of money” is what he now blames for ruining New York’s creative culture, exculpating himself in the process. Moby’s indignation just sounds like Walrus and Carpenter-level tears of rage. Rather than feel cathartic or caustic, it’s oddly cold and rote.  \"],[22530,\"In the lauded D.C. punk band Priests, Katie Alice Greer’s voice holds a great deal of narrative responsibility. While her politically-inflected lyrics often slide toward the opaque, the quality of Greer’s singing works to make ideas and feelings legible: she hollers her lines, her voice cracking as she bends phrases over her bandmates’ driving basslines and squalls of distorted guitar. Greer’s performances can become soaked in feeling, albeit in a distinctly serrated way. Priests’ music isn’t inviting in the traditional sense, but it acts nonetheless as an invitation to participate in some communal seething.Alongside the build-up to Priests’ first full-length release, Greer has quietly released a solo EP as KAG, recorded following a move from D.C. proper into the suburbs. The four songs that comprise EP A are built from industrial drum machines, iterative guitar phrases, and a generous amount of metallic squealing and tape hiss—an uneasy composite of unfinished textures, rather than something anthemic. If her output with Priests serves as a rallying cry, Greer’s solo effort is more isolated, better suited for private bouts of anxiety. Throughout, vocals come in and out of focus, in moments barely recognizable. On “Diana Ross,” perhaps the tensest offering, Greer sings in a haunted falsetto that smears what might be lyrics into pure affect—a poignant act of obfuscation, given that the song is a tribute of sorts to another great, and complex, frontwoman. (In both interviews and her own songwriting—see “Lana,” for Lana Del Rey, on Priests’ 2013 EP Tape Two—Greer appears consistently fascinated with woman popstars as cultural signifiers, sites of something like femme mythmaking.) On “Sister Ruth” and “Narcissus,” her voice is faraway, sometimes picking up to a more insistent pace, sometimes receding below all-but-unintelligible samples of people chattering and other ambient urban noise. Greer’s talent for composing moody collages of unraveling sound is a pleasant revelation. It makes “Baby Judy” an outlier here, a comparatively gentle and sincerely delivered synth-pop song.Generally, it sounds as if it might be a relief for Greer to dissolve a bit into a self-built world, one where there’s less pressure to signify and, consequently, more room to feel out the contours of everyday life’s disquiet. Her lyrics, though largely unintelligible on the recordings, are published on the project’s Bandcamp and are worth a read. When she references other women’s stories—on “Diana Ross,” or in nods to the film Black Narcissus, for example—she seems to be reaching out to these characters to find form, but succumbing to formlessness is also a theme: “Your sexuality is nothing like you say,” she mutters from somewhere deep within the mix on “Sister Ruth.” “It’s just something that floats away\\/It’s something you could never really keep at bay\\/Water that takes shape.” The sentiment is neither strictly political nor strictly personal. In its sung form’s obscurity, it reminds us that sometimes, legibility—and its attendant form, visibility—can feel like a trap, to women onstage and off. \"],[22507,\"I don’t know if technology has accelerated the process of nostalgia, but we’re only six years removed from the blip the words “witch house” created on the music scene, and even fewer than that from when art-damaged kids creating abrasive rap seemed novel. Self Restraint, the latest album from the Northampton, Mass. rapper Gods Wisdom of the New England-based Dark World collective arrives feeling strangely dated, as if it’s an artifact from 2011 or 2012. The tropes are there, from “666” in Gods Wisdom Bandcamp URL, Tumblr-inspired “wtf” samples (like a snippet of “The Simpsons” here or old news footage there) to the music videos made to look as if they’re shot on VHS; the obsession with the most obvious staples of rap is there, too, from booming low-end to hyperbolic  boasts (“in high school I had sex with my teacher” from “2 Lives” is a galling moment, because it’s unclear if this is supposed to be funny or obtuse—it doesn’t work either way), and it’s all done in a manner that suggests this stuff is blazingly au courant. (Noted cool person Kim Gordon, for instance, put Gods Wisdom in her Top Ten of 2015 for Artforum).Some of the songs work on a goofy, outré level—in spite of its many forehead slapping punchlines, “2 Lives” (which is two years old by the way) rides a triumphant trap beat that Gods Wisdom slathers his voice over with a hook from fiery singer\\/songwriter Mal Devisa, and it’s a discomfiting piece of music, something that escaped Western Massachusetts and ended up sounding almost fresh, perhaps because instead of winking and telegraphing all of its weirdness, it just kind of exists. Before that, “Respect Women” works a brooding, minimal beat like a good Lil Yachty song does, and Gods Wisdom manages a few memorable lines: “So heavy metal\\/sexuality of the devil\\/I’m going out like James Dean\\/but so much colder.” Self Restraint bottoms out when Gods Wisdom attempts to create a ruckus, though—instead finding some catharsis in the noise, like avant-rapper B L A C K I E does, it’s just an endurance test—there’s no greater meaning behind the mess. His attempts at “going weird” like the “Peter Piper”-reminiscent bells on the lethargic “Leather Wings” don’t have enough oomph behind them to help Gods Wisdom access the confidence held by similar artists like Juiceboxxx or Baltimore’s Schwarz. It feels hollow, a bunch of signposts (classic samples, smooth jazz sax, vague vaporwave vibe) that don’t point anywhere. (It’s maybe worth noting at this point though that another Gods Wisdom track, “Beep Beep,” is a deliriously silly earworm that is better than anything on Self Restraint.)And unfortunately, while his sleepwalking-Folk Implosion-meets-Lil Uzi Vert delivery has intermittent charm, it overwhelms the record and for the most part a lot of Self Restraint sounds like Salem Part 2, but updated to a more current operating system. Instead of chopped and screwed rap, the record takes some cues from drill and even Waka Flocka Flame, two inspirations that also stopped being novel in 2012. The opening title track and “Paranoia” are basically Salem songs, noise dripped into rap rhythms with blasé vocals on top—a pointedly unpleasant listening experience. There’s even a micro-staple of witch house—the left-field cover—on Self Restraint, “On the Beach” (yes, Neil Young), which exists outside the parameters of good and bad. It’s a Rorschach test. Did you find something cool\\/rebellious\\/interesting in the ugly, casual nihilism of witch house? Then you should like this. If you thought it was all hollow “but that was the point,” you might like this. If you’d rather listen to literally anything else, keep moving.\"],[22521,\"Say what you will about Kings of Leon: They are probably one of the last groups we’ll watch go from scrappy garage-rock origins to scoring mainstream radio hits and headlining arenas and festivals with the old-school battle-stance of two guitars, a bass, and a drumkit. They are more of an actual rock band than contemporaries like the National, or St. Vincent, or Arcade Fire—those indie titans that too transitioned from the small rooms to the big fields. You know the narrative by now: sheltered Southern kids raised on religion, finding rock ‘n’ roll and sin, then sobering up and settling down. It’s a classic narrative, one that's almost too perfect in its adherence to tropes. There were all the cringe-worthy lyrics about dangerous women and the bandmembers’ own profligacy. There were also, at one point, songs that were invigorated and scuzzy and endearing enough to swat away concerns about a doofy band playing into all manner of classic bad-boy rock archetypes—the types of rock songs few others have been swinging for in the 21st century. Those are the things about Kings of Leon that come across as real enough. But as they sold their souls over again—this time not for boozy Southern rock, but for schlocky corporate-music refrains—all sorts of questions popped up. What even is this band? “Southern Strokes turned Southern U2” is the oft-cited transition, but over time both comparisons began to feel overly generous. Instead, the Followill crew’s arena-conquering material lumped them closer to mewling radio-rock bands than the indie sphere with which they'd flirted. When it was just “Use Somebody” and Come Around Sundown, it was still easy to hope that Kings of Leon would reclaim some of the roughened charm of their earlier work. “Supersoaker,” the lead single from their 2013 album Mechanical Bull, had even hinted at a return-to-form; it had the earworm ease of the best Aha Shake Heartbreak cuts, but conveyed it with a little more clarity and control. And while the songwriting across that record proved unsteady, it was at least a turn in the right direction. It offered an image of Kings of Leon as grizzled almost-veterans, no longer forcing choruses to soar when they could be more evocative as they rumbled.  Well, then they made WALLS. It’s their seventh full-length, and it too marks a return-to-form, but this time the form they're revisiting is the soulless would-be transcendence of all the worst stuff on Only by the Night and Come Around Sundown. This is, uh, not the form they should return to. WALLS mostly finds Kings of Leon back in that mode of offering up fast-food “whoa-oh” singalongs and guitars that chime as distinctly as wallpaper. If you’re amenable to that version of Kings of Leon, you’re in luck. “Reverend” and “Waste a Moment” join a growing lineage of songs the group has offered up in the last eight or so years, a lineage in which the names and melodies are becoming increasingly hard to distinguish from one another. Sure, these songs get stuck in your head, but they’re not exactly welcome there. The catchiness of these songs is like a party guest who is trying too hard; the choruses and big, glistening guitars have an irritating tenacity. Name almost any song on WALLS: “Around the World,” “Over,” “Eyes on You,” “Wild”—any of them could slot in as third-tier answers to “Sex on Fire” and “Radioactive” and “Use Somebody.”There are glimmers of something else, hints of why this band has been likable to many over the years, hints of other places they could've gone. The jangling guitars and light moodiness of “Find Me” conjure a style of twilit early ’80s highway-rock that could suit Kings of Leon well as thirtysomething journeymen. And “Muchacho” is an evocative barroom lament, the kind of thing that has you picturing aged faux-outlaws refusing to cry into their whiskey in some distant desert saloon. There's more grit and gravity in frontman Caleb Followill’s delivery here than anywhere else on the album; it makes you wonder if there was more where this came from. It makes you wish for a latter-day Kings of Leon album that was more rugged. One where you can feel the miles they’ve traveled, rather than the ticket sales of the festivals they’ve headlined and no doubt hope to headline once more. Sadly, they seem content for the kind of mediocrity that designates you as the headliner Firefly and Bonnaroo call when someone else isn’t available. \"],[22512,\"The valences of “pop” and “weird” have become increasingly compatible in the last half a decade—Miley Cyrus eschewed her post-“Hannah Montana” trend-hopping for an album co-written by Wayne Coyne, PC Music traded in their outsider art status for an imprint deal with Columbia, and member Danny L Harle released a track featuring vocals by Carly Rae Jepsen. But the mainstream has always cherry-picked from the underground and alternative artists have always had pop proclivities. (Remember The Whitey Album, Sonic Youth’s tribute to Madonna?) Nothing about this overlap is particularly shocking or rebellious anymore—from albums to playlists and beyond, the monoculture always finds a way, and everyone will someday inspire Kanye West.Sound designer and producer-turned-musician Katie Gately falls into the Avant-Garde Goes Pop category. She works with found sounds and meshes those odd samples with pristine vocals to create more than just tokens of her findings. Her debut full-length Color, out on premiere outré label Tri Angle Records, is certainly exploratory pop but adheres to certain sounds of the mainstream at its core. Gately’s work may not be mistakable with Katy Perry’s, but what sets her apart from the avant-pop pack is that her constructions have the sublime polish of Top 40. Her songs are infectious the way pop should be but without perfunctory lyrics, and they stick to you because what Gately creates ends up sounding just so very big.Gately benefits from sound design know-how from her film production MFA studies at USC and her professional experience. This skill set benefits the intricacies of her beat constructions—harmonies built on tweaked vocal samples to bolster her own voice (“Sift”); cello and garbage-can percussion eloquently melding to make something reminiscent of grunge, but still reflective of current electronic trends at its core (“Frisk”). But Gately’s work is more in line with Lady Gaga’s theater-kid tendencies than, say, Grimes. Her work is likely to be compared to Holly Herndon and Björk, particularly because of the Haxan Cloak’s involvement with Vulnicura, but its forebear is really Madonna’s Ray of Light (save its sugarcoated title track). That album may not sound particularly revolutionary in 2016, but in 1998, the meshing of ambient, trance and electronica for a massive mainstream audience has helped pave the path for the last 20 years of pop music. Gately, working alone, somehow takes the dark tones of that album, bolds the colors and makes it sound even more expensive.It’s both something old and something new for Tri Angle. Despite having previously housed artists like How to Dress Well and AlunaGeorge, the label’s name tends to evoke abrasiveness —the deconstructed club destruction of Rabit; Lotic’s silvery violence or the blistering funeral procession led by the Haxan Cloak. Its recent signees, R&B-classical hybridist serpentwithfeet alongside Gately, signal a push away from the acerbic that is still able to straddle the label’s interest in anxiety.This is what makes Color so remarkable. It boasts the sort of large-scale electronic compositions that can often feel monolithically lonely, and she does it all by herself. And yet the album sounds and feels collaborative, as if it were the product of multiple viewpoints and inputs. It seethes with so many  sounds and ideas that it sounds like a conversation, rather than a monologue. You hear that particularly on tracks like “Sift” and the album’s lead single “Tuck,” as it twists through global influences—some of which are maybe a little bit questionably appropriative, similarly to Madonna’s exploration of celebrity-style Buddhism—that invoke the presence of others. Sometimes those shifts don't always land; “Sire” climaxes with too much distortion, and “Rive” utilizes an orchestra that sounds more demented than inventive.Tri Angle releases tend to point toward the future, and with Gately’s album, it means that lo-fi pop is bounding for more gloss. But the ultimate takeaway from Color is not just another unconventional vision of what’s to come, it’s circling back to the label’s origins. Despite the gloom or brutality of Roly Porter or Evian Christ, it still has a Lindsay Lohan tribute album in its history. Granted, that mixtape, 2010’s Let Me Shine for You, is comprised of erstwhile witch-house covers and remixes by the likes of Laurel Halo and Oneohtrix Point Never, but it portended so much of the composite dance music to come. Gately’s effort is not just a blockbuster of a debut, it is the next stage in Tri Angle’s obsession with pop music as an influence - and the first that is primed to have the world pop world return the favor.\"],[22508,\"Andrew Weatherall may not have produced Jagwar Ma’s second album, Every Now & Then, but his paw prints are all over it. Following tours supporting their debut LP—and a close call with a shark in their native Australia—Jono Ma and Gabriel Winterfield headed to Europe, first to the derelict French sunflower farm where Howlin’ was recorded, then to Le Bunker, the London recording studio of the famed acid house DJ and home to his enormous record collection. “Andrew was in close proximity towards the end,” Ma told Stereogum in a recent interview. “But I think most of the themes and the music had been written by that point, so I don’t think he’s had a direct influence per se.” The adjacency to Weatherall may have been a happy accident, but for Jagwar Ma—whose music is hugely indebted to Madchester and Primal Scream—the overlap is too perfect to ignore.Weatherall, who co-produced Primal Scream’s Screamadelica and helped forge the “baggy” sound of the 1980s, has served as a sort of musical north star for Jagwar Ma. (Screamadelica, the band has said, is a favorite album and he remixed their song “Come Save Me” in 2013.) In Pitchfork’s review of Howlin’, writer Ian Cohen lauded the carefree aspects of the album, but feared the band's sophomore record might wind up a “‘darker,’ ‘introspective’ and duller sequel.” As it turns out, Every Now & Then is the opposite; rather than turn inward, Jagwar Ma build on their first record’s foundation, going bigger and broader, while continuing to look unapologetically in the rearview mirror. As with Howlin’, the neo-psychedelic music of Manchester’s club scene remains an inseparable part of the band's sound. Lead single “O B 1” could be compared to the Stone Roses, New Order, and Primal Scream, depending on which YouTube commenter you ask. (It also has more than a little bit of Giorgio Moroder’s driving synths.) As with many songs on the album, the sugary lyrics serve mostly as a conduit for the melody. “You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now,” sings Winterfield. The song succeeds precisely because Jagwar Ma refuse to take themselves too seriously. Synths shimmer, Whitefield’s voice is studiously mixed, and the drums, courtesy of Warpaint’s Stella Mozgawa, have a hypnotic circularity, but it's all in the service of a good time. Ma has said the track is about “moving through the motions of life under the influence of lost love, the fear of letting go of the past when not having anything set in place in the future to hold on to,” but, in truth, larger themes are secondary to the band’s primary goal of flooding the listener's serotonin centers.Much of Every Now & Then is anchored by the sound of the Oberheim Two Voice synthesizer, a vintage machine with a compressed, funky zap that Ma bought on eBay. The Oberheim occasionally pushes their sound further into the 1970s, a decade that fellow Aussies Tame Impala know well, and which suits Jagwar Ma’s stadium-sized aspirations. Unlike friend-of-the-band Kevin Parker, however, Jagwar Ma don't have a particular interest in avant-garde experimentalism or pop economy, instead preferring mid-tempo tracks that check the necessary boxes: big hooks, ravey breakdowns, the occasional inspired left turn (see: the Egyptian Lover-recalling electro track “Don't Be So Hard”). The album's highest highs are, not surprisingly, their most anthemic musically. “Ordinary”—a track that isn't— sees Whitefield’s voice arc like chemtrails across a neon sky. The song combines Britpop excess, the Ibiza dancefloor, and a vintage hip-hop breakbeat all without sounding forced. Jagwar Ma are also comfortable when settling deeper into dancefloor groove. Album closer “Colours of Paradise” embraces a headier form of bliss for nearly six minutes of Balearic house.  Jagwar Ma join a lineage of Madchester acolytes that range from Brooklyn’s Dinowalrus to the Swedish popsters on Sincerely Yours. But part of the allure of Madchester was the constant search for new forms of perception—through sonic experimentation as well as mind-altering chemicals—something that Jagwar Ma’s crate-digging fails to invoke. Every Now & Then is often vivid and enjoyable, but after a few listens, you may find yourself switching back to one of the band’s predecessors. The former is a fun ride, but Screamadelica could still blow your mind. \"],[22509,\"On the surface Matt Kivel’s tastes seem familiar enough. The Los Angeles songwriter draws from more or less the same pool of consensus folk and lo-fi influences as countless other indie acts from the last two decades, but there’s something vaguely contrarian about what he draws from them. To judge purely from his solo albums, he’s the type of guy who prefers “Night Falls on Hoboken” to “Autumn Sweater,” “Fillmore Jive” to “Silence Kit,” Mount Eerie to the Microphones, The Velvet Underground to The Velvet Underground & Nico. He finds more satisfaction in exploration than payoffs. His least favorite part of his favorite song is probably the hook.   Fires on the Plain is Kivel’s second album of 2016, and given how his records demand more time than most listeners will ever give it, he probably hasn’t done himself any favors by releasing it so soon after the last one. It’s a doozy, too, weighing in at 26 songs and 82 minutes—for those keeping score, that means Kivel’s released more than two hours of music this year, much of it so understated that it can’t help but blur together. Yet despite the similarities, Plain often plays less like a continuation of its predecessor Janus than a reaction against it, walking back that album’s comparatively tight, brightly colored compositions with Kivel’s most muted, unhurried treatments yet. There’s actually more going on this album than on any other Kivel release—more horns, more intricate guitar passages, more outside collaborators and guest voices—but because it all unfolds so leisurely over such a vast pan shot, it feels like his most minimalist work. This thing breathes.  It seems as if after three albums that barely sold, Kivel has given up on making music for anybody but himself, but Plain does feature a modest sales hook in the form of appearances from Will Oldham and Fleet Foxes’ Robin Pecknold, who respectively duet with Kivel on a pair of woodsy, close-miked duets with complementary titles, “Forgiveness” and “Permanence.” That’s smart target marketing, because fans of both of those artists’ more patient work will find plenty to enjoy if they stick around for the rest of the album. It’s a sign, perhaps, of how different Kivel hears music that Plain is seriously backloaded, with most of its highlights tucked away after an unflashy, mostly uneventful opening stretch.  But what a pleasure it is when the album finally opens up. The terse guitars of “Black” deliver a shock of classic rock. “Other Shore,” Plain’s prettiest number, is a vulnerable bossa nova that’s sent off, in the spirit of “Walk on the Wild Side,” with a gust of saxophone. And then there’s “Whirlpool,” which with its dizzy, sticky riff may be the closest Kivel has ever come to writing a big-ticket indie song. His voice even rises to the occasion, too, swelling from a timid Ira Kaplan whisper to an emboldened Win Butler croon. The Butler resemblance is strong enough that I can’t listen to that song without imagining how Arcade Fire might have played it—doubtlessly, they would have sold the shit out of it. Kivel, of course, doesn’t go that big. After spending enough time with these songs, it becomes clearer why he plays them so close. Fragments of a non-linear story emerge: a suicide, followed by grief and at least a few regretful benders. These are the kind of details you don’t shout to the world; you keep them to yourself. One of these songs is called “Light Depression,” and that title could also double as an apt genre tag for much of Fires on the Plain. Whenever the emotions threaten to become too vivid, the volume returns to a calming mummer as Kivel retreats, seeking safety in softness and quietude.\"],[22463,\"Weyes Blood makes serious music, but she doesn’t take herself too seriously. Proof of that can be found in the final seconds of Front Row Seat to Earth, the fourth full-length from the singer\\/songwriter\\/producer born Natalie Mering. A brass band breaks through the din of hazy film samples and warped classical piano with the kind of royal proclamation that declares, “I’m here!”—just as the soiree is ending. Oops! Or look to the album’s cover. The scene—a river winding through a dystopian landscape, with Mering perched on her side in the middle of it all, clad in a stylish turquoise satin suit—is mesmerizing. Then the eye moves towards her shoes: beat-up sneakers. What the hell?Front Row works sort of similarly. The songs overflow with tender harmonies worthy of a Roches record and ornate instrumentation (from Mering and a strong cast of contributors) that blends ’70s AM radio, the psychier end of late ’60s folk, and touches of Celtic and Renaissance music. But listen closer and there's often a slightly alien (and typically electronic) undercurrent that keeps you intrigued. It’s there in the ominous synth line that rises up from below a peaceful acoustic and tasteful woodblock and shakers in “Away Above,” and again in the deadpan background vocals that haunt “Seven Words” just below the surface of a doe-eyed slide guitar solo from Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy.The over-the-top pinnacle of this effect comes on the knockout six-and-a-half-minute single “Do You Need My Love,” where Mering sustains a note—on the word “need”—intermittently in the song’s last half. All around her calm belt, calamity stirs: a brass band, piano chords, a thick bassline, graceful and complex percussion, and above all, an ominous synth that glows like an orb, brighter and brighter to the end. Keep in mind, this is a song that two minutes earlier, featured a breakdown comprised of psychedelic organ and thunder noises, which sounds like an oddly specific combination to anyone who hasn’t endured the Doors. At times Mering really does sound like “Enya Does the Lost Songs of Karen Carpenter (Backed by Ray Manzarek).” But thankfully her lyrics don’t also lose themselves in mystical platitudes borrowed from generations past. She cuts through the bullshit here: “Do you need someone?” she asks, walking the line between robotic and serene. “Do you need my love?”As much of a throwback as Mering can seem, at her best she captures her era in her words. On “Generation Why,” arguably the album’s centerpiece, she actually sings the letters “YOLO” with more thoughtful care than the phrase ever deserved. Using the kind of dulcet finger-picking and flowery folk-singer phrasing that’s been easy to dismiss as wimpy for decades, Mering essentially chronicles how she learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. “I’ve been hanging\\/On my phone all day\\/And the fear goes away,” she says, trying to embrace the kids’ distraction of choice from the coming end times. Later, she surmises, almost kicking herself halfway through for jinxing it, “It’s not the past\\/That scares me\\/Now what a great future\\/This is gonna be.”Even Mering’s less philosophical takes feel distinctly modern. “Be Free,” the song that sounds the most like a waltz, finds her embracing an independent approach to drifting apart that seems more now than of the free love era its far-out sounds might have worked within. “It’s just the two of us\\/And I want you to be free\\/Don’t worry about me\\/I got my thing,” she sings. As first she sounds perfectly clear (the record’s production is excellent), but by the end, in creep those alien background vocals again. It’s this ability—to twist an homage just enough to show that you’re aware of how totally saccharine it sounds—that makes Mering shine in a way she hasn’t on her albums up to this point. She commits more fully to the world she’s building here, though 2014’s sprawling rock rumination The Innocents is not without its highlights. Her approach (not her sound) recalls Angelo Badalamenti’s lush, over-the-top score to “Twin Peaks.” It was overwhelming and kitschy, but you could tell that he knew it, particularly when paired with David Lynch’s work. Mering’s music might sound like it belongs from a bygone era, but she definitely knows it. If you listen closely enough, you can start to locate her in this fantastical backdrop—sly and assured. What, doesn’t everyone wear sneakers to the apocalypse?\"],[22513,\"At the wild, cramped party that is Los Angeles rap, Boogie’s the guy sitting in the corner, sermonizing about the desperate conditions black parents in his neighborhood face while flicking through photos of his son on his iPhone. The deep-thinking lyricist might be straight outta Compton at a time when the city is the center of the hip-hop universe again, but he’s kept his lens focused on his own. Even the one unequivocal banger in his canon, “Oh My,” was about poverty and police brutality when you stripped out the high-rise keys and booming bass.The impressive Thirst 48 and The Reach mixtapes—released in 2014 and 2015, respectively—found Boogie pondering the kind of issues that keep South Los Angeles parents up at night. That both were released on his young son’s birthday signaled their heavily personal nature. Thirst 48 Pt. II might be presented as a sequel to his debut, but it feels like an advancement of his style. Boogie has emerged from behind his living room curtain and stepped into the California sun, slickly shifting from the blurry synths and lurid drum machines that punctuate most of his catalog to a brighter sound that embraces his geographical roots.It’s not like Boogie has dropped the pen, though. On opener “Still Thirsty,” he shuffles through all the issues weighing on his mind: the pressure to succeed, fear of poverty, relationship hang-ups, parental struggles. “We went from tears at the bottom ’til we almost top tier,” he raps, “my biggest fear is I don’t finish through.” Moments on Thirst 48 Pt. II underline what we already knew: the South Angelino is one of the sharpest West Coast writers right now.Boogie raps over piano chords with the same open-book sentiment that Tupac once did. The sweetly caressed keys of “Won’t Be the Same” channel the spirit of “I Ain’t Mad at ‘Cha,” if ‘Pac rapped about his girl instead of an old friend. That line connecting past to present is crystallized on the DJ Quik-featuring “Fuck ‘Em All.” With Sacramento’s Mozzy brought along for the trip, the trio rib over the kind of wonky, tweaked-out beat Snoop and posse would have jumped on and had a ball with in the mid-’90s. Boogie adapts to these good-time flavors as easily as he once skulked in the sonic shadows.Elsewhere, “Slide on You” sees him go down in the DMs over some smooth ratchet finger snaps. “Sunroof,” meanwhile, is better than any rap song that rides an acoustic guitar has any right to be. Boogie shows California love on the West Coast anthem, which channels everything from ‘Pac’s odes to his home state to the sweet ’60s harmonies of the Mamas & the Papas. But he’s not in a such a positive mood that he can’t work in a line like, “You a good day, you like a hood day with no police.”With this shift in lanes, Boogie sometimes sounds like he’s trying to run the modern-day commercial rap gambit. He gives a report on a new relationship through the prism of their social media interactions on “Two Days,” and ponders stealing his friend’s girl on “Just Might.” (“I just might fuck your wifey out of spite,” he sneers). There’s a newfound level of steel in his voice on the latter. It’s evidence that his flow has sharpened year after year. Pt. II’s free throw percentage would have been bolstered by the inclusion of pre-release singles “Out My Way (Bitter Raps II)” and “Man Down.” But the tape does something more crucial: it proves that even when he falls into line, Boogie still stands out from the crowd.\"],[22412,\"The conventional wisdom says that punk and electronic music aren’t supposed to mix, but the two genres have a long, proud history together. Suicide, Devo, Throbbing Gristle, Big Black: All of them put electronics at the center of their practice and made a fearsome racket while doing it. And why not? Electronic instruments are the ultimate DIY tools. As Mute Records founder Daniel Miller, of the electronic post-punk act the Normal, put it, “The thing that pissed me off about punk was you had to learn three chords to be in a punk band. If you had a synthesizer, all you had to do was press one key.”Oscar Powell makes electronic music that is both techno and punk all at once—and yet, a little like Schrödinger’s cat, it is also neither. It flickers unstably between the two genres, running acid squelch against lumpy drum samples, and drilling bursts of harsh, digital noise into basslines that still wear the stink of a Lower East Side basement, circa 1983. There’s a palpable sense of two worlds colliding. The timbre and heft of many of his sounds testifies to their provenance: The room tone identifies them as products of chilly practice spaces or cheap recording studios, and the guitars have the tinny sort of clang that you only get with old, scratched-up 7 inches. But it all takes place in the airless, deathless netherworld of the computer, with short snippets of fluid, human timekeeping chopped up into infinitely repeating loops, and a riot of voices—talk-show clips, shouts, muffled dialogue, and, at one point, what I’m pretty sure is Mark E. Smith's nasal sneer—scattering like the fragments of a malfunctioning hard disk. Powell has never made any secret of his influences. Instead of punk’s “kill yr idols” maxim, he taps directly into their energy via song titles like “Wharton Tiers on Drums,” a reference to the no-wave musician and record producer, and “No U Turn,” presumably after the iconic drum ‘n’ bass label. He sampled Suicide’s Alan Vega on “Should’ve Been a Drummer,” and he sampled Big Black on “Insomniac.” He’s clearly immune to the anxiety of influence—perhaps to any kind of anxiety at all. When Big Black’s Steve Albini sent Powell a sternly worded email in response to a request for permission to sample the recording—“I detest club culture as deeply as I detest anything on earth,” wrote the cantankerous Chicago producer, “so I am against what you’re into, and an enemy of where you come from”—Powell blew it up and pasted it to a billboard above a busy London thoroughfare. The irony, of course, was that had Albini actually listened to Powell’s scabrous, mangled beats, he probably would have liked them.The artists Powell tends to reference aren’t just any punks; they’re artists who never really fit in anywhere. That’s an instructive way of looking at his own work, caught as it is between two opposing systems, not quite at home in either one. Like his heroes, he values qualities like risk and danger, qualities he has said he finds missing from contemporary electronic music. He shares with his influences a certain provocative, even anarchic spirit, one that colors and informs virtually every aspect of the project, in ways that can seem both incredibly dumb and remarkably thoughtful. A video for “Jonny [ft. Jonny]” features crowdsourced footage of fans bashing open watermelons with their foreheads; yet in lieu of a typical press campaign for the album, he opted to post his email address on a billboard, and then answered each of his correspondents’ queries personally, often giving them links to unreleased songs. That contradiction—the knuckle-dragging, tongue-in-cheek trickster vs. the generous, WYSIWYG plain dealer—is a big part of his appeal.Powell used to work in advertising, and there is no doubt that he is an exceptionally savvy salesman of his own work. But Sport, his debut album, goes deeper than mere provocation. What we find here is a fully formed aesthetic, far richer, far livelier, and far more fun than the tentative mood-pieces he offered on his earliest singles. A few songs are noticeably more sophisticated than his earlier work: “Frankie [ft. Frankie]” and “Jonny [ft. Jonny]” massage gravelly synthesizers, heavy metal solos, and rollicking rockabilly grooves together with husky vocals from HTRK’s Jonnine Standish in a way that recalls electroclash, of all things—but fucked up and broken down, a zombie farce of turn-of-the-millennium dance-punk fusions.Throughout, Sport is crude, queasy, sometimes shockingly ugly, and often quite funny, in a madcap, slightly threatening way. It thrills and it mystifies in equal measure. The music is riddled with glitches, but these aren’t the sleek, hyper-aestheticized clicks and cuts of highbrow minimal techno; they’re the sounds you get when you jiggle the patch cable in its socket, or when the pads on your sampler are gummed up with beer. The steady spray of found vocal samples—a woman griping, “I hate a few things, yeah”; a young man slurring, “Fuckin’ kick-ass!”—gives the impression of a television showroom broadcasting a dozen skate videos at once. The haphazard way it’s all stuck together, with palm-muted guitar licks pasted over stumbling kick drums and dissonant keyboard mashing, often resembles little more than shreds videos, those parody clips where rock performances are overdubbed with hamfisted skronk and sly Foley effects.Shreds videos are about creating an off-kilter alternate universe, a Bizarro World where pop stars are hapless clowns, and Sport does something similar with dance music, stripping of it of its sophisticated patina and returning some of the rough-and-tumble rush that Powell remembers from his teenaged days, taking drugs and dancing to jungle. By pulling the rug out from underneath our assumptions, he gets us moving again. For all its sardonic sense of humor, the album never feels like it’s laughing at the listener. It just refuses to take itself, or anything, seriously—even, or especially, punk. After all, what could be less punk than sports?\"],[22504,\"Whether making black metal under the name Altar of Plagues or electronic music as WIFE, multi-instrumentalist\\/producer James Kelly has consistently asserted himself as an artist who forges his own path. With both projects, Kelly has actually worked within established genre boundaries, but he’s also introduced unorthodox touches that place his work in a category by itself. His take on black metal, for example, captures the primal savagery of early pioneers like Darkthrone and Emperor while simultaneously drawing from a much broader emotional and musical palette.In a rare best-of-both-worlds scenario, Altar of Plagues has managed to convey Kelly’s love for classic black metal and still exude a sense of freedom to explore goth, shoegaze, and—perhaps most crucially—a sensitive disposition that even the most high-minded black metal auteurs still tend to avoid. If Kelly’s recent shift away from Altar of Plagues’ blast-furnace tonality shocked any of his fanbase, it really shouldn't have. By that point, his penchant for tasteful subversion was well established.WIFE’s 2014 debut full length What’s Between consisted of lacy electronic music draped around a singer-songwriter frame. Even more drastically, Kelly wore his R&B\\/soul vocal influences on his sleeve. But when you strip away the surface distinctions, What’s Between is cut from the same moodiness as all of James’ previous work. The new WIFE EP Standard Nature is arguably James’ most truly shocking move to date, not so much because he’s shifted stylistically again, but because this time his music sounds downright joyful in spots.The differences between Standard Nature and What’s Between jump out within seconds. Opening instrumental “Wide Nine” establishes the beat-driven format that Kelly sticks to throughout the EP’s five songs. But again, Kelly makes his left-of-center approach clear almost as quickly. “Wide Nine,” for example, starts out as if it’s going to sustain its initial club-bound direction and even suggests that it might turn into a dance number. It doesn’t, the beat melting by the 1-minute mark into a hollowed-out scaffolding of its own shape, the remainder of the song playing almost like the morning-after memory of a night of revelry.Moreover, while each of the five songs abounds with jaw-rattling drops, Kelly shows his versatility by underlaying the rhythmic boom with an array of disparate elements. On second track “Standard Nature,” for instance, Kelly sings in a style that recalls a church choir performing hymns on a high holiday. And on “Lovelock,” Kelly uses a vocoder to channel his inner Tobacco. Meanwhile, “Glass Interruption” features strings that eventually swallow the song’s glitchy first half, only to be swallowed in turn.On “Native Trade,” Kelly takes soft keyboard swells—the kind we often hear in heartstring-tugging film scores—and scoops them out with intervals of silence, so that the tune stutters while evoking puffy clouds of drama. As always, Kelly weaves different shades of solemnity into a rich meshwork. And as time goes on, Kelly’s music gets more and more refined, so that it evades simple descriptors like “somber” and “dark.” But, where Kelly has utilized myriad shades of gray up to this point, on Standard Nature he expands beyond gray tones and demonstrates a rare ability to make overcast music that bursts with color. At this point, we can probably bet that Kelly will change his approach again next time. Which means that Standard Nature’s pleasures are likely to be fleeting—like the songs themselves, a suggestion of an idea that’s over before it gets a chance to fully develop. But if nothing else, as Kelly’s body of work has shown, his need for constant evolution is one of his defining characteristics. On Standard Nature, he stays true to that and leaves enticing hints of more twists and turns to come.\"],[22389,\"Imagine it: You grew up in Oxnard, Calif. Your dad went to prison for beating your mom. You had a kid with your second wife. You lost your job, and a place to live. You were homeless.Your friends looked out for you. You slowly picked yourself up. You changed your name: Breezy Lovejoy became Anderson .Paak. You gained some traction, partly by redoubling your focus on your vocals, leaving the beatmaking to producers you trusted. Some Soundcloud hits followed, some friendships with well-connected rappers, a sophomore album, Venice, on which your voice had gone from a blunt instrument to a swiss army knife, able to do 15 different things at once.And then you got the call. From Aftermath, Dr. Dre’s label. A representative was checking to see if you were interested in the American dream, California rap edition—in working with an icon you’d been listening to since you were six years old. You made it.Channel that experience, .Paak’s own recent past, into a single song, and you might come up with something like “Livvin,” the first proper song off Yes Lawd!, his new joint album with the beatmaker Knxwledge. “Livvin” is triumph incarnate, a new entry in the tradition of “ashy-to-classy” tracks like “Juicy” and “Touch the Sky.” .Paak preaches the gospel of success in between rolling drums, mellow horns, and a church choir. His voice’s inextricability from the music is a testament to his chemistry with a producer steeped in the tradition of the beat scene godheads, Dilla and Madlib. (.Paak and Knx, whose real name is Glen Boothe, have merged their names into NxWorries, an apparent nod to the definitive Stones Throw duos, Jaylib and Madvillain.).Paak’s sudden stardom, largely due to his work with Dre and to this year’s Malibu, his extraordinary third album, might tempt listeners to give him the credit for Yes Lawd!’s many successes. But the record, which includes tracks recorded between early 2015 and March 2016, is first and foremost a beat tape, stacked with beautiful little donuts, most of which don’t pass the three-minute mark. Knx was raised on church music, hip-hop radio, and J Dilla, and the rich instrumentals here are loaded with tributes to all three. “Sidepiece” offers .Paak a chance to sing the lyrics of “Won’t Do” from Dilla’s posthumous album The Shining: “One won’t do and two is not enough for me, no,” while “Can’t Stop” is a zoned-out moment of musical reverie that intimately recalls Jay Dee. The beats are the soul of the album, and .Paak serves as a faithful instrument, the organ at their core.Producers have fallen hard for .Paak and here, he shows several reasons why his stock has risen so quickly. He’s uniquely aware of the flexibility of his voice as an instrument and is one of the more emotive rappers I can remember hearing, on a level with DMX or Young Thug. On “Best One,” even as he expresses gratitude for a woman who’s taken him in, you can hear urgency, and empathy, in his voice: “You know I could be leaving in a moment’s notice\\/You telling me to stay to the morning\\/You know a nigga homeless.” On “Lyk Dis,” he channels no one so much as Erykah Badu, riding the beat with gravelly, percussive verses delivered in short bursts.In the past, Knxwledge has had trouble focusing on a particular sound for too long, but it’s his focus that holds the record together through 19 tracks, even as he shows off his range. On “What More Can I Say,” one of the prettiest songs here, mournful violin strings engage in a duet with a quiet bass rumble, and their interchange makes for some of the most moving music on the album, particularly when the horns arrive. (If you pride yourself on recognizing samples, this album will offer up a form of exquisite torture at least a couple of times, as you attempt to track down lovely little fragments.) The shuffling beat on “Link Up” is one of the more subtle offerings here, but its winding rhythms and muted sample make .Paak sound as if he’s singing from the middle of the dancefloor, appropriate for a song about nocturnal pursuits.Many of .Paak’s songs are about going out, and particularly about women, and it’s in their lyrics that Yes Lawd! reveals one of its only issues, a lack of lyrical substance. While an artist like Drake comfortably straddles the line between rapper and R&B singer, .Paak is more of a crooner than a rhymer. There are too few moments like the clever little lyrical elaboration on “Best One”: “I could leave it at a drop of a fedora\\/But damn it girl I want you.”And what we get instead can be ugly. On “Livvin,” .Paak sings about the feeling of ascending the ladder, but on some songs, it seems like he’s pulling it up behind him. The sentiment toward other strivers on “H.A.N.” is stingy, and .Paak’s portraits of his relationships are often shallow—a fact that the final track “Fkku” seems to acknowledge, giving a woman’s voice the record’s final kiss-off. The worrisome thing here is not that .Paak can be sexist. It’s that there’s nothing to counter or contextualize his attitude. On “Suede,” .Paak makes an explicit effort to justify the slurs he frequently uses: “If I call you a bitch\\/It’s cause you’re my bitch\\/And as long as no one else call you a bitch\\/Then there won’t be no problems.”The records that .Paak and Boothe admire, the classic Stones Throw collaborations, found two artists working at the absolute height of their talents. Madvillainy, in particular, was a perfect match between an internal rhyme genius in Doom and a beatmaking savant in Madlib. That album, released in 2004, remains a high water mark in Stones Throw’s history. .Paak and Knx are both so talented that it seems fair to hold them to that standard. And what’s astonishing here is the way they manage to forge a sound nearly as rich and original as that of America’s most blunted. One of the few disappointing things about the largely terrific Yes Lawd! is the way that Knx outdoes .Paak, but the rapper\\/singer is at the beginning of a bright career in which he’s already demonstrated his ability to write rich lyrics—this record, which includes some of the most beautiful songs he’s made yet, has far more to be proud of than not. It’s another major accomplishment in .Paak’s continued rise.\"],[22499,\"Nobel Prize precedent aside, this is not a particularly great time to be a pop singer-songwriter. Royalty pay is underneath the toilet for most songwriters for hire, and solo songwriters aren’t faring much better. What used to be, for better or worse, its own genre—a solo acoustic, piano or guitar, maybe some strings—is practically nonexistent in today’s market. The pop chart has drowned it out for years. The alternative music charts are capricious, but lean rock and male. The adult contemporary chart is basically just the pop chart, minus rap. \"],[22495,\"Ever since they first slicked on the corpse paint in 1986, the seminal Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone have raged an unrelenting war on the Puritanical mores of the West: devout Christianity, blind patriotism to both God and Country, the status quo’s broader distrust of anything rock. Of course, as the original espousers of “True Norwegian Black Metal” and former associates of Burzum’s gun-toting, white nationalist frontman Varg Vikernes, they’ve had to swat off many an accusation of racism.Considering Darkthrone’s anti-establishment mindset in tandem with their controversial past, it’s easy to label them outcasts–and yet, in 2016, Gylve “Fenriz” Nagell and Nocturno Culto are hardly pariahs. I’m not just speaking in terms of the metal community, either: just this year, Nagell’s neighbors in the Oslo suburb of Kolbotn elected him—the debauched king of KVLT!–to town council. (The musician, to his credit, did his best to dissuade voters; his “campaign” comprised but a single photo of the bearded axeman cradling his adorable cat, with the caption “Please don’t vote for me.”). “I’m not too pleased about it. It’s boring,” he later grumbled to CLRVYNT, later admitting, a bit begrudgingly: “I’m a pillar of my community.”Darkthrone’s seventeenth studio album, Arctic Thunder, bristles with a similar recognition of power, albeit over a far more hostile constituency than the prankish Norwegian suburbanites who stuck Fenriz in office. Like most of Nagell and Culto’s output since downsizing to a duo two decades ago, it’s an album tailor-made for a diverse metal electorate. Rather than Xerox their classic A Blaze in the Northern Sky, the pair express their longstanding aggression through a seamless, genre-hopping lexicon of death growls, doom dirges, and thrash runs as immediate as they are all-encompassing.Don’t mistake their expanded palette for a lack of focus: as always, Darkthrone keep these eight songs’ latent chaos on a tight choke-chain, timing the hellish tremolo riffs as carefully and slowly as an October surprise; before arriving at the weepy pinnacle of lead single “Tundra Leech,” we must first power through the Pentagram-y crunch of both verse and chorus, its already-dramatic lurch made all the more queasy by otherworldly groans, trembling and liminal like a vengeful spirit howling from the other side of the void. That haunting catharsis seems downright generous, however, compared to cuts like “Throw Me Through the Marshes” and “Inbred Vermin,” which offer even less tangibility and resolution: the guitars’ firm-footed cadence does little to allay the mounting dread inherent in their creeping backbeats, Trojan horses to presage the duo’s imminent (but nonetheless unpredictable) sludgy torrents.However foreboding their latest effort may be, Nagell and Culto aren’t out to scare us shitless—as with its predecessor, 2013’s excellent The Underground Resistance, Arctic Thunder’s predominant mood is one of playful, if unflinchingly perverse, glee: a thirty-nine minute, low-stakes stampede down memory lane, recorded at the Bomb Shelter rehearsal unit they utilized at the end of the ’80s, back when their nightmarish journey started. The album’s proliferation of feel-bad jams ensures an entertaining listen that’s bound to shut up the purists who consider the band’s downsizing a detriment—in fact, even as a duo, Darkthrone have never sounded more like themselves. Considering how important transparency is to politics, as well as music, it should come as no surprise that Nagell attained public office. Of course, being photographed with a cute cat didn’t hurt, either.\"],[22461,\"“I had a lurking interest in African music for a long time, but that door had never quite opened for me.” So Mark Ernestus said last year in discussing how he went from being a driving force in Berlin techno to delving headfirst into African music. It was a long road: Ernestus founded record shop Hard Wax—ground zero for techno in post-Berlin Wall Germany—and with partner Moritz Von Oswald they released totemic techno as Basic Channel, Maurizio, Phylyps, Round One, and more before evolving into the dub-heavy Rhythm & Sound. And as that project wound down, Ernestus encountered a DJ set featuring the Gambian dance style, MBalax.“I was hooked on the spot,” he said. “It was clear to me that these were not just a few interesting tunes and that there was more where this came from.” Soon after, Ernestus began releasing a series of singles credited to the Senegalese ensemble Jeri-Jeri.Almost from the beginning, house and techno lifted from African music, making for tribal house and tracks like Caribou’s ferocious dance edit of “Ne Noya.” But Ernestus’s Senegalese projects—first as Jeri-Jeri and now with the slightly more streamlined Ndagga Rhythm Force—feel less like a techno master taking a passing fancy in African music and more of an attempt to grapple with this centuries-old music on its own terms.Ndagga Rhythm Force won’t soon be mistaken for bigger Senegalese stars like Youssou N’Dour or Baaba Maal, though the rhythmic root of them is similar. Ernestus simply puts the family of sabar drums forward as the main attraction. That the rolling thunder of polyrhythms created by Senegalese drumming (which can be heard from 15 kilometers away) resonated with a techno producer whose entire discography could mesmerize with little more than a kick, the space between each hit, and the columns of air it shoved aside should come as no surprise. While NRF is a slightly larger ensemble than Jeri-Jeri, it sounds more spare and focused. There are nine players in total on “Simb” but there is so much sonic space for the keyboard chords and guitar to skate about the drums that you might think it’s the work of a trio. Restrained, melancholic, the slow, slinking track brings to mind Miles Davis’ ’70s work, somewhere between the haunting elegy “He Loved Him Madly” and the menacing python-slither of Agharta. At least until Mark Ernestus triggers the bass drum, resulting in a tone so deep and rumbling that it could be a detonation from the asthenosphere, an instance of a beat that plummets a track into profound depths rather than sends it higher.Between Ernestus’ production and mixing desk wizardry—to say nothing of the mastering job of Rashad Becker—it’s easy to get drum-drunk off of Yermande, to be concussed into submission. The battery of sabar drums are as relentless as a waterfall yet the depth of sound suggests a canyon, creating a sense of space so that hi-hats and talking drums clatter at the fore on “Walo Walo” while cannons discharge far on the horizon. The cumulative effect is both techno-fast and dub-slow. There’s a club pulse to tracks like “Lamb Ji” and “Jigeen,” but rather than just use the goat-skin drums to mimic machines, they instead land just off-grid, pulling and tugging so that no rhythm can be precisely determined. The drums fall like rocks on a mountain road on the former and gleefully accelerate the latter to the breaking point.Released as a single last year, “Yermande” might be the most thrilling dialogue between German electronic engineering and African drum talk. The guiding beat wallops like a classic break and the hi-hat pattern is feverish, while echo and delay stretch out the anthemic synth chords, guitar and voice of Wolof singer Mbene Diatta Seck. And when the tungune, talmbat, and thiol drums burst through, the track pulls in two directions at once: furious breakbeat and syrupy dub. It’s a speedball of rhythm and sound as only Ernestus could capture it.\"],[22494,\"Even as he came into his own as a soul singer, Jamie Lidell never seemed ready to completely let go of his identity as a laptop experimentalist. At times over the last decade Lidell has seemed torn over the kind of artist he’s wanted to be, a prestige IDM producer or a mass-appeal blue-eyed soul act, and on recent albums those two visions have seemed increasingly irreconcilable. Rather than building a reputation as a shapeshifter in the vein of his sometime-collaborator Beck, he began to come across as just kind of erratic—especially on the misguided, Morris Day-by-way-of-Squarepusher fusion of his 2013 self-titled effort, a peanut butter-and-olive-sandwich of a record that tried to play to both of his skillsets but flattered neither. On Building A Beginning, though, Lidell stops trying to have it both ways, unplugging his laptop for the most conventional R&B album of his career.   The album’s title could refer to a number of fresh starts. It’s Lidell’s first since splitting from Warp Records, the label he’s called home since his solo debut and whose cache gave him cover to crossover without alienating his old electronic audience, and it’s filled with ruminations on his rekindled romance with his wife (who co-wrote the album’s lyrics) and, even more significantly, the birth of his first son. The album’s most direct tribute to his newborn, “Julian” is one of the most unabashedly jubilant songs he’s ever written, equal parts Jackson 5 and Maroon 5. “There’s no way to un-see the harshest things I’ve ever seen, but now you’re here and life’s a dream,” Lidell sings like a man born again. “Now my life’s worth living.”  So Lidell’s in a good place these days, and he spends the album in awe of his good fortune, high off of familial bliss. Never shy about borrowing from Stevie Wonder, he pens his own “I Was Made to Love Her” for his son with “I Live to Make You Smile.” Elsewhere he looks to other soul greats. The title track swoons with the weightless grace of Al Green’s heyday records, introducing the distinctly Hi Records-esque backup singers who support him throughout the record, while “Find It Hard to Say” looks to the afterhours quiet storm of Smokey Robinson. There are flashes of more modern R&B, too. “Don’t Let Me Let You Go” lifts the blissed-out piano plinks of the-Dream’s early singles, and the album highlight “Walk Right Back” offers a tighter, more tasteful take on the ’80s electro-R&B that came across so jumbled on Lidell’s self-titled record. That track is suave enough to be an Anthony Hamilton song, and really, Hamilton is probably the best possible model for Lidell when he's working in this lane, since nobody else is making records that span so many eras of soul quite so effortlessly.But game as he is, Lidell isn’t nearly the singer Hamilton is, and his performances usually revert to the same two notes, either mawkish sentimentalism or overeager gleefulness. He attacks many of these songs with the unflappable cheer that other artists reserve for Target-exclusive Christmas albums, and while there’s some pleasure in satisfaction in Lidell’s joy, beyond that Beginning doesn’t offer many thrills. If this is his new beginning, it’s an unambitious one: Lidell has never sounded like more of a traditionalist than he does on this amiable but uncomplicated record.\"],[22440,\"Terry Allen released Lubbock (on everything) via the minuscule Fate Records in 1979, just as the outlaw country movement started to run out of gas. Allen never was an outlaw. He was an outsider, a visual artist who wrote songs on the side and played museums instead of honky-tonks. That calculated distance is evident on his 1975 debut Juarez, where he divides his time between recitations and skeletal arrangements that, at their fullest, featured guitar and piano.The same can’t be said of Lubbock (on everything), just reissued in a lavish edition by Paradise of Bachelors, which also put Juarez back in circulation this year. Allen recorded the double album in his scorned West Texas hometown of Lubbock, a city he left as soon as he turned 17. Flipping a coin, he and his then-girlfriend—now wife of 55 years—Jo Harvey wound up choosing Los Angeles over New York City, so the two hightailed out to the West Coast, setting up shop and beginning to establish themselves within the art world. Allen’s songs gained some attention, including that of Little Feat leader Lowell George, who had hoped to record Allen’s song “New Delhi Freight Train” for his band’s 1971 debut. George decided to wait, though, until Allen left his bad record deal so that he could actually score some royalties.Allen broke free from that contract around 1976 and Feat did cut the tune for 1977’s Time Loves a Hero. A year earlier, the country singer Bobby Bare recorded Allen’s song “Amarillo Highway” for his Cowboys and Daddys album. It was then that Allen decided to cut the songs he’d composed since the completion of Juarez—including “Amarillo Highway”—and cooked up the notion that George could produce part of the album, while none other than his art-world friend Laurie Anderson could handle the other. Instead, Allen headed back to Lubbock, the town he abandoned years ago, to record with locals Don Caldwell and Lloyd Maines.Lubbock music was then in the throes of one its periodic hot spells, spearheaded by Joe Ely, Butch Hancock, and Jimmie Dale Gilmore—a trio who performed as the Flatlanders between 1972 and 1973. By the time Allen got to Lubbock in ’78, Ely was the king of the scene, earning attention for his recent Honky Tonk Masquerade. Ely’s band was pulled into the studio to support Allen.Ely had been channeling some shit-kicking roadhouse boogie into the plaintive panhandle country of the Flatlanders. And while Allen never deigned to dabble in hardwood floor honky-tonk, Lubbock (on everything) does benefit from a band consciously withholding its full power. They turn Allen’s satirical sketches and odes to art into something robust, full-blooded rambles through the byways of the flatlands of West Texas. Sometimes, the music really does cook. “New Delhi Freight Train” moves along just like a locomotive, and the band works up a groove on “Amarillo Highway,” not coincidentally the album’s two most covered songs.But usually the group allows Allen to indulge in his sly jokes. Witness the louche lounge sway of “Cocktails for Three,” the beer joint stomp of “Flatland Farmer,” or how “Truckload of Art” hinges on a piss-take on Slim Whitman’s “Cattle Call.” All this derives from Allen knowing West Texas so well he can’t help but snipe. Often, Allen doesn’t bother to hide his contempt at his former hometown, which does goose the performance: he seems to be gaining fuel from a band that allows him to sneer, but also to cloak his occasional tenderness in a woozy waltz.Such a pointed sense of remove—Terry Allen isn’t a participant, he’s an observer—is one of the reasons Lubbock (on everything) is ungainly called an “urtext” of alt-country, with the other being the music’s rootless rootsiness. As it sways between country and folk, it feels thoroughly specific yet consciously ambiguous: music intended to stray from its home. Influential it may be, but that also seems beside the point. Like any enduring piece of art, Lubbock (on everything) embodies its moment while transcending it. Allen couldn’t have recorded this album at any other point than 1978, after the outlaws opened the door for genuine outsiders in country music, and after singer\\/songwriters like Randy Newman paved the way for barbed cynicism to be part of the pop vernacular. Decades after the Lubbock of Allen’s childhood has passed, this double-LP is still a powerful dreamscape, capturing a West Texas that may never have quite existed, but Lubbock (on everything) certainly makes it feel like it did.\"],[22496,\"Perhaps the most surprising thing about Mono making a record inspired by Dante’s The Divine Comedy is that it took them nine albums to do it. Since their dramatic 2001 debut Under the Pipal Tree, the Japanese ensemble’s arrangements have only swelled, growing ever grander and more orchestral—like a lot of instrumental post-rock bands, they’ve often struggled with how to one-up themselves. So on Requiem for Hell, their ninth album, they look to nothing less than the mother of all epics, Dante’s account of the journey of man’s soul, on a song cycle patterned around the rhythms of life and death. If that all sounds lofty, it is, but no more so than any other Mono album from the last decade. At this point in their career, going big is their default play.  Hell’s title makes it clear which installment of The Divine Comedy most captured Mono’s imagination. There’s a reason why every high school English curriculum assigns Inferno but hardly anybody makes it through Paradiso. Graphic depictions of sinners submerged in shit and gnawed at by three-headed dogs are inherently more exciting than scenes of celestial figures politely discussing theological doctrine. Like Dante, then, Mono cut right to the lurid stuff, the peeling flesh and showers of scalding sand. Opener “Death in Rebirth” speeds up the band’s usual slow build a bit, its guitars taking only a few minutes to reach a sinister, Locrian-esque squall. The song runs with the heavier influences Mono played up on 2014’s Rays of Darkness, but it’s more convincingly fierce than anything on that record, one of their most effective flirtations with metal.The kinder, gentler strings and glockenspiels of the album’s shortest piece “Stellar” initially seem like an attempt to sooth some of the burn of that opener, but really it’s just a misdirection, a pause for the band to reset the stage just so Requiem for Hell’s title track can pour kerosene all over it again. That 18-minute centerpiece is a mixed bag, encompassing the album’s showiest thrills but also its most tedious stretches. Its payoff comes early, when the guitars erupt around the five-minute mark, and the acrobatics that follow are exhilarating. But eventually the track begins to play out like an Aristocrats joke, an exercise in how needlessly long you can stretch out an idea without it collapsing under its own excess. By its shrill final stretch, the song is no longer intensifying so much as simply sustaining the illusion that it’s intensifying; the noise circles around itself in a kind of infinity loop, like a GIF of an M.C. Escher staircase. The only payoff is that it ends.Hell’s overloaded title track doesn’t do any favors to the album’s more subtle, paradise-inspired closing compositions. Lovely as they are, “Ely’s Heartbeat” (set to a sample of the in-utero heartbeat of a friend’s child) and the ponderous closer “The Last Scene” barely even register after all that noise. And really, that’s the story of the band’s whole catalogue: When you go full hog so readily, the smaller moments inevitably get dwarfed. It’s a trap Mono have always struggled with, and anybody expecting them to figure out a way around it on album number nine probably should have moved on years ago.   The harshest knock against Mono has long been that, consistent as they are, they haven’t contributed a single original idea to the genre. And it’s true: They’ve never attempted anything that hasn’t been done before and better by Sigur Rós, Godspeed! You Black Emperor, or Explosions in the Sky—instead they merely shuffle those same tropes into something comfortingly familiar. It’s not as glamorous as recording classics, yet in a way their prolificacy seems tuned to the way music is consumed now. In the streaming era, where albums are no longer pricey investments but essentially free to anybody with a Spotify or Apple Music plan, there’s a lot more room in the market for this kind of mid-tier post-rock. If you’re in the mood for a good-enough orchestral rock album that lifts and falls in all the expected ways, you might as well queue up one you haven’t heard before. Mono are doing their part to keep you in a steady supply of them.\"],[22497,\"Though trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith is a leading maestro of abstraction, he loves a straightforward concept as much as anyone else. Over the last decade, he’s composed The Great Lakes Suites, as well as the expansive Civil Rights-themed project Ten Freedom Summers (which drew from avant-jazz and modern-classical languages). For his 2016 album with pianist Vijay Iyer, Smith wrote a tribute to the African American contralto Marian Anderson.  Musical dedications are now as much a part of Smith’s process as the experimental nature of his fiery improvisations. But these historical shout-outs are not just creative prompts that he uses to get his writing hand going. Smith’s monuments often develop into sly editorials. When the composer extends his Civil Rights-era meditation to include 21st-century events, it’s his way of diagnosing the lingering nature of vintage prejudices.America’s National Parks clearly fits in among these trends in Smith’s latter-day output. The double-album contains the veteran jazz quartet that helped power Summers, and adds in the impressive cello work of Ashley Walters. While the ensemble’s size is smaller than that of the group that recorded Summers, this lineup has the same jazz-plus-classical range of instrumental attack. And Smith’s commentary resides in his choices of grounds to celebrate. These include national parks already in operation—like Yellowstone—but also hallowed cultural zones not yet recognized by government decree.The title of the opening movement, “New Orleans: The National Culture Park USA 1718,” references the pre-American nature of the city’s founding by the French Mississippi Company. Yet the loping quality of the opening groove shows that Smith is commending this location as a potential national park on the basis of its relationship to jazz. The tempo is slow, and sometimes makes way for beat-free stretches of sound. But overall, it still has a finger-snapping, swinging feel—thanks to the way bassist John Lindberg and drummer Pheeroan akLaff emphasize the underlying pulse.At first, the mood occupies a middle ground between celebration and solemn observation—as Smith’s trumpet switches from bright lines of heraldry to subtler harmonizing with Walters’ bowed cello lines. Then, a few minutes in, a faster beat arrives. Smith responds with a muted-trumpet solo full of pristine, bluesy poise. Eventually, the pianist (and excellent composer) Anthony Davis gets a lengthy feature that closes with an impressionistic, dreamy cadenza. At this juncture, the opening track is barely half over—and it’s already given listeners a trio of distinct, memorable worlds.As with other ambitious projects from Smith, America’s National Parks wants your focused attention, and your time. But the rewards it offers can make those substantial requests feel justified. The most dramatic mix of styles comes during the half-hour piece “The Mississippi River: Dark and Deep Dreams Flow the River—a National Memorial Park c. 5000 BC.” Grim piano chords and ominously bowed strings suggest a potential for violence, before the album’s most powerful stretches of free-improv bashing make good on the threat. (Smith describes this “park” as “a memorial site which was used as a dumping place for black bodies by hostile forces in Mississippi.”)Elsewhere, the stark, sometimes violent majesty of the natural world is conjured by imposing blocks of atonal modernism, during “Sequoia\\/Kings Canyon National Parks: The Giant Forest, Great Canyon, Cliffs, Peaks, Waterfalls and Cave Systems 1890.” And a tender beauty is fostered in the chamber music writing of Smith’s most abstract, conceptual idea in this series: “Eileen Jackson Southern, 1920-2002: A Literary National Park.” (Southern was the Harvard musicologist who wrote The Music of Black Americans, among other important works.)The album isn’t quite the overwhelming achievement that Ten Freedom Summers was, though the refined ensemble playing of Smith’s newly convened “Golden Quintet” is consistently ravishing. And the duration of the set gradually proposes a unique charm. Once you travel all the way to a monument, you don’t take a quick look and then leave. In similar fashion, these extended tributes create a persuasive argument regarding the attention still due to a nation’s history, and its cultural variety.\"],[22458,\"Between Atlanta and Athens, Northern Georgia historically has a knack for churning out some truly freaky, funky acts that can create and innovate outside the claustrophobic East Coast hype bubble. Atlanta quintet Warehouse have existed in this world since first meeting in part at elementary school and then in full years later at Georgia State University. Less than a year after forming, they were receiving recognition from notable local Bradford Cox, who told Pitchfork that one of his best moments of 2013 was “Seeing the band Warehouse play live: They are a new cool young art-punk group from Atlanta. They evoke Pylon but are very much doing their own thing.” Those outside of Atlanta were able to hear what he meant once Warehouse quietly self-released their first album, Tesseract, in 2014. Tesseract’s complex-but-pleasing harmonies  quickly caught the eye of blooming Brooklyn label Bayonet and in 2015 it was re-released as a cassette for the masses to consume. super low is Warehouse’s sophomore effort, taking the strengths of its predecessor and building on them like the Robert Rauschenberg works they mention as inspiration. Like Rauschenberg’s thick collages, Warehouse’s reliance on improvised collaboration results in gems buried amongst their dischord. Ben Jackson and Alex Bailey are responsible for laying each track’s foundation with twisting, jangly guitars, then bassist Josh Hughes and drummer Doug Bleichner add subtle, but strong, flourishes. Finally, there’s the voice of Elaine Edenfield, which stretches and snaps like a rubber band, scratches like Janis Joplin’s howl, and, occasionally, sinks to a mournful murmur. It’s Edenfield’s voice that elevates Warehouse beyond that vague, empty label of “art-punk” and fills them with accessible emotion.super low opener “Oscillator” kicks things off with a groovy reverie. Immediately after “Oscillator” ends, Edenfield rips into “Exit Only,” her voice seesawing between a commanding rasp and a disheartened mutter. All the while, the instruments are marathoning behind her, remaining in tight conversation that manages to sound effortless. “Audrey Horne,” a clear reference to the sassy “Twin Peaks” character, jumps back and forth between opposites, both in terms of the contrasting tight shredding and loose breaks and lyrically: “Like the prefix and the suffix\\/There is a before and an after\\/And it is not here nor there.” Penultimate track “Modifier Analog” chugs along in a similarly composed fashion as the rest of super low but its concluding Broadcast-like swirling breakdown destroys any feelings of monotony before the album gets too comfortable.super low’s biggest banger is “Simultaneous Contrasts,” a growling track about disparities that surfs down the guitar neck to ride a quick riff. “You and I\\/We come from separate worlds,” Edenfield groans before hiccuping “The fevered eyes\\/They’re ruining my life.” The so-called “fevered eyes” float through super low like ghosts in addition to images of purgatory and fading away. The undercurrent of super low is that of loss, a supreme feeling of heartache. The title track reaches a place of resolution, “I can’t destroy the things\\/They keep me alive\\/And I can’t destroy the things\\/That lead to where you lie.” Shortly after, “Reservoir” continues to search for control in a relationship amidst tragedy. Originally intended to be a simple love song a la Belle and Sebastian, “Reservoir” instead results in a difficult embrace of reality—in its own way, it’s more romantic than any traditional ballad. Edenfield chokes through reassurances like “And when all your smoke and veils fall\\/I am with you\\/And never leaving” and “I can tell we’re heading towards the apex\\/Or the end\\/And either way\\/It will be fine.” Warehouse surpass any art-punk labeling through careful, deliberate construction and vulnerability. While some might feel that their complex melodies become a little repetitive, I urge you to listen closer and find the devil in the details. They have planted many careful embellishments just below the surface, and if you find them, it will make glorious sense out of their chaos.\"],[22308,\"Since his teenage days marketing demos to pop singers, Randy Newman has fancied himself a shirt-sleeves-rolled-up piano man in the classic mold more than a rock musician—a Laurel Canyon-era Hoagy Carmichael or Harold Arlen, if they wrote about young women being run over by beach cleaning trucks or lonely men with hat fetishes. Guitar leads and crisp grooves crop up across all of Newman’s studio albums, but live, he defaults to performing alone, interspersing his intimate, charmingly imperfect sets with self-deprecating banter and sarcastic qualifications.His sense of humor, even outside of his caustically funny songs, can be polarizing. For one critic—Greil Marcus—a February ’75 Newman show proved toxic, threatening to overturn his reverent opinion of the Los Angeles singer-songwriter. With his stage banter and rave-up delivery, Marcus felt that Newman was lampooning the morally compromised but disenfranchised characters who populated his album of the previous year, Good Old Boys, which was written largely from the perspective of a bigoted Southern steel worker. “He made it clear that the song [“A Wedding in Cherokee County”] was a joke, that the people were jokes, that their predicament was something those smart enough to buy tickets to his concert could take as a sideshow staged for their personal amusement,” Marcus wrote in The Village Voice, excoriating the tittering, cocktail-sipping Manhattan crowd.If Good Old Boys came out today, the nature of the criticism would, doubtless, be quite the opposite. Newman, who spent his childhood in New Orleans, would not have passed sufficient judgment on his racist, abusive subjects. He’d be criticized for assuming their detestable vocabulary, and for even dreaming up such a project in the first place. Any discussion of the album begins and probably ends with the fact that on its opening track, Newman — speaking as the steel worker, whom he named “Johnny Cutler” on early drafts for the album — says the “n”-word eight times, not including one use of “Negro.” Cutler is a gaping all-American nightmare in the vein of Mark Twain’s Pap. In the song, he seethes while watching Lester Maddox—the Klan-backed, segregationist governor of Georgia from 1967 to 1971 — be jeered offstage on “The Dick Cavett Show” (by “some smart-ass New York Jew,” Newman sneers).“Rednecks” was a few steps, or a parkour leap, beyond any grotesque character study Newman had previously attempted, even 12 Songs’ masterclass in voyeuristic white privilege “Yellow Man” (“Eating rice all day\\/While the children play\\/You see he believe in a family\\/Just like you and me”) and “Sail Away,” his slave-trader salesman pitch to a group of Africans (“Climb aboard, little wog\\/Sail away with me”). Cutler is so content to wear his ignorance like a badge of honor in “Rednecks” that it’s easy to mistake some lines for Newman’s own voice nervously interceding to denounce him. The surging, C&W-tinged chorus of “We’re rednecks, rednecks\\/We don’t know our ass from a hole in the ground” functions as both Greek-chorus commentary on the action and Cutler’s motto. (It’s harmonized immaculately by—yes—the Eagles, who would conveniently drop out before “and we’re keeping the n*ggers down.”)To make things even thornier, Newman folds bits of salient criticism about the hypocrisy of holier-than-thou Northern white liberals—in denial about the institutionalized segregation of their own communities—into Cutler’s objectionable voice. “Now your Northern n*gger’s a Negro\\/You see he’s got his dignity,” Cutler sneers facetiously, before leading a whirlwind tour through the implicitly ghettoized North (“He’s free to be put in a cage in Harlem in New York City\\/He’s free to be put in a cage on the South Side of Chicago, and the West Side”) with revival-meeting-like gusto that forces him off the beat entirely. The orchestra, in turn, seizes up and derails beneath him before thudding to a sudden halt. It’s the first indication that this album is no simple character study, but a composite survey of the roots and institutionalization of Southern bigotry in the 20th century—in other words, the diciest and most formidable project Randy Newman had (and has) ever attempted.Newman sells his pivots and double-meanings skillfully in “Rednecks,” the album’s microcosm, through both his character building and deceptively intricate music—peppered with gestures that could have been pulled from ragtime standards, brass-band chorales, and the mid-19th-century popular songs of Stephen Foster. Like most of Good Old Boys, the song was scored for piano, full orchestra (largely arranged and entirely conducted by Newman), and rock rhythm section (expert bass and drums from L.A. studio masters like Jim Keltner and Willie Weeks, inspired by Muscle Shoals productions).Today, “Rednecks” might seem like a relic, or baiting, self-satisfied armchair-liberal-ism at cross-purposes with itself. What constructive function does this kind of “humor” serve? By any stretch of the imagination, does Newman have the right to invoke this language? It’s an open question, but Hilton Als’ measured defense of Flannery O’Connor’s non-biographical, darkly humorous, “n”-word-studded Southern fiction comes to mind, especially his praise of the Georgia-born author’s rare ability “to depict with humor and without judgment her rapidly crumbling social order.” This, too, is Newman’s subject and methodology. His characters’ vocabulary pulls back the curtain on their self-hatred, so he doesn’t have to butt in and do it for them (O’Connor called this “mind[ing] your own bisnis”). He illuminates their fear of becoming marginal, their search for fundamental truth in all the wrong places, and the dead-end rituals of behavior and thought that anchor their communities. Newman’s narrators are the ones in his crosshairs; their unworthy targets are never dragged down with them—never roped into the songs’ action to ossify into caricatures and become punchlines. Lost in their demented reveries, and powerless to tell their imagined nemeses’ stories for them, Newman’s basket of deplorables are left to fall on their swords all by themselves. Jeff Chang deemed Newman’s approach, in defense of “Korean Parents” —another incendiary Newman song from 2008 —“the best kind of race humor… found by wedging open the wound long enough to stare at, and then sharing the joke in that. Of course, the trick is that you need to be the one who's bleeding.”Newman felt that he needed to write “Birmingham” and “Marie,” to “explain ‘Rednecks’ better.” From there, Cutler became the necessary protagonist of his new album, which was to be called “Johnny Cutler’s Birthday.” “Birmingham” introduces Cutler’s family and home life with humorous banality; the darkness is left unspoken but you can feel it looming behind its jaunty string figures and horn oompahs. “Marie,” an emotional release for both Cutler and the listener, is a desperate paean by a blacked-out Cutler to his wife (for whom Newman also wrote a scrapped solo song and a duet), with a luxuriant string arrangement—an emotional release for both Cutler and the listener. There is something approaching honest self-reflection (“Guilty”), and then Cutler’s ultimate cop-out—a return to his escapist after-work routine (“Rollin’”). Across these songs, Newman expertly scales the depressive plateaus of the low-functioning alcoholic—the gentle, bluesy sensibility of the music feels appropriate, and makes for savage musical irony when the overlying scenes get dismal enough (they always do).Newman also wrote interstitial songs for Good Old Boys—originally imagined as diegetic entertainment at Cutler’s 30th birthday party—which relayed tall tales, jokes, and fudged biographies of Cutler’s heroes. While sketching these, Newman would grow obsessed with the political career of Huey Long, the noted Great-Depression-era Louisiana governor, party-busting senator, short-lived presidential candidate, and megalomaniac. His research into the contradictory Long—part pseudo-socialist, part vindictive bigot—would force his pen away from Cutler, toward a broader-stroke compendium of Southern snapshots and lore.“Louisiana 1927,” the first Long song and an apt musical sequel to “Sail Away,” examines the Great Mississippi Flood and the federal government’s mishandling of it, which stirred up class resentment, around which Long would build his candidacy for governor in the following year. “Every Man a King” is a barroom cover of an actual Long campaign song, espousing the rhetoric of his proposed (and completely untenable) “Share Our Wealth” program. Long promised to cap income and redistribute funds to make every American “a millionaire”—or at least, every bit as good as the highfalutin' ones calling the shots in Washington.Long’s big production number, though—and arguably the album’s greatest musical triumph — is “Kingfish,” the best campaign speech in pop music history (though it’s unclear if it has any competition). It’s all glitzy, triumphant showmanship in the verse; even if we don’t know the history, we can sense the visceral allure (“Who took the Standard Oil men and whooped their ass?\\/Just like he’d promised he’d do?”) Discordant strings circle like buzzards in the would-be inspirational chorus (“Kingfish\\/Friend of the working man”), implying the proud, vengeful man hiding behind the catchphrases; here, the album’s resonances with America’s current political imbroglio become impossible to ignore. “Kingfish” is the Donald’s “I’ll fix it” platform stretched across three minutes of music. Long promises to make Louisiana great again by fashioning its government in his own convex self-image: that of the self-made man who is not afraid to speak truth to power, or rather, exalt xenophobia to a moral imperative and deride the proverbial Northern fatcats he was no better than. Long was often drunk during his fiery live appearances, and the spasmodic rhythms of the song mirror that live-wire energy: “I’m a cracker, you are too\\/Don’t I take good care of you?” Good Old Boys creates a rich sense of time and place, contrasting interior and exterior settings, and his characters’ public and private selves, cinematically. “Marie” is a wee-hours argument in the kitchen; “Kingfish” is cavernous, roaring, the sound of an unruly political rally; “A Wedding in Cherokee County,” on the other hand, is intimate parlor music. The opening riff sounds like a turn-of-the-century pop song, played off some weathered, forgotten sheaf of sheet music found in the piano bench. But then, an ornery new character begins to describe the pitfalls of living with his mute fiancée in the backwoods of Alabama; in the waning moments of the song, he bemoans, in lofty euphemisms, his erectile dysfunction (“But though I try with all my might\\/She will laugh at my Mighty Sword”). A classic American tale, really. Despite, or more likely, because of moments like this, Good Old Boys would be Newman’s first remotely successful release as a solo artist, providing some nagging perspective on the charts just as loud-and-proud Southern rock acts like Lynyrd Skynyrd, Charlie Daniels, and the Marshall Tucker Band were rising in popularity. The album was heralded by positive reviews and promotional literature that spread word of its controversial material, as well as an ambitious tour, including some dates with 80-plus-piece orchestras. It didn’t hurt that it was overstuffed with great pop melodies; its listenability seduced listeners into examining and reexamining its troubling themes. It became Newman’s first to clear the top 40—or even crack the double digits—on the album charts.It also marked the moment at which Newman’s career turned a lonely new corner. These were not, like songs on his previous albums, ones that could be easily plucked from their context and marketed to other singers. Bonnie Raitt’s pre-existing, less skeletal version of “Guilty” would be a rare exception. There had been plenty of unlikely Newman interpreters (in one of the most head-scratching examples of master-imitating-disciple, Ray Charles covered “Sail Away”), but the image of a contemporary pop vocalist—Tom Jones or Donny Osmond, perhaps—delivering “Papa was a midget\\/Mama was a whore\\/Granddad was a newsboy till he was 84” was tough to conjure.From that point forward, Newman would begin to become an island unto himself. He charted a couple of widely misunderstood, if brilliant, hits, before putting the better part of his energy toward film scoring. In 1977, “Short People”—absurdist, rock-ified, nursery-rhyme catchy — would go to No. 2 for mostly the wrong reasons; the uproar surrounding the song (another rumination on prejudice) would result in record-burning parties and Newman’s face on dartboard targets, and prompt him to give the audience a raspberry when he performed it on “SNL.” “I Love L.A.” would be played at Clippers games and receive heavy circulation on early music television; Maroon 5 would cover it with pride and the Kardashians would rewrite it, all despite the defining line “Look at that mountain, look at those trees\\/Look at that bum over there, man, he’s down on his knees!” Both were regarded as novelty songs—as “You’ve Got a Friend in Me,” now Newman’s biggest claim to fame, ultimately would be—and so Newman became, to non-acolytes, a novelty act.Perhaps, in another universe, he might have remained more at the center of the pop songwriting world, whether or not he was singing on the records (his voice had always been a hard one to sell). But his compulsions forced him elsewhere. “I like to know what makes people tick, what their mothers and father were,” Newman told journalist Paul Zollo. “Why they talk the way they do, using this sort of word or that sort of word. What it all means.” Randy Newman, in that search for meaning, became the king of the unreliable narrator in American popular music, and one of rock’s greatest lyricists full-stop. But part of earning the distinction involved venturing into dark corners, and inhabiting them for a while; in his Good Old Boys review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Davis would use this logic to diagnose Newman as deeply “troubled.” It was a dirty job, and certainly, no one had to do it. It was usually thankless and almost always alienating. But it also yielded one of the best singer-songwriter albums of the 1970s, which remains as shocking, pristine, and regrettably relevant as the day it was released.\"],[22390,\"In his 1995 book Ocean of Sound, David Toop talked to Dr. Alex Peterson about the music he would go onto make with the KLF’s Jimmy Cauty, the music that began chillout clubs and ambient house and eventually the Orb itself. “We’d build melodies up…we used to keep it very, very quiet,” Paterson said. “We never used to play any drums in there. It’d be just like…BBC sound effects, really.” By the next year, Bill Drummond and Cauty would release the beatless and blissed-out Chill Out while Paterson would venture off as the Orb, adding in some drums to “Little Fluffy Clouds,” the ambient house genre well afoot.To hear Paterson spin it in advance of the Orb’s sixteenth album, “the idea was simply to make an ambient album.” But considering the KLF’s Chill Out (not to mention its iconic cover art of sheep lounging in the English countryside), there’s a telltale Orb cheekiness to naming this album Chill Out, World, or COW. Fittingly, both harken back to Pink Floyd’s Atom Heart Mother and that cover’s cow. But twenty-five years after making the classic ambient house record with The Orb’s Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, why scrub off the “house” bit so as to render that kind of smooth ambient record now? As the other half of the Orb, Thomas Fehlmann, puts it, “it seem[ed] like a good idea for people to sit back and chill the fuck out.” That said, it’s still a tad disarming to hear “The 10 Sultans Of Rudyard (Moo Moo Mix),” full of birdsong and Harold Budd-esque piano (courtesy of Roger Eno himself) with no Orb-y snickers or elbowed ribs thrown into the mix. Even more stunning are the seven minutes of “First, Consider The Lillys,” another track woven from field recording. There are crickets and water gurgles and a hazy bit of strings like sunrise breaking on the distant horizon and the duo are careful to mimic a landscape’s biorhythms, ever-so-slowly thickening the sounds into a stew of hand percussion and twinkling keys, before withdrawing back into an ambient haze of crickets and processed pedal steel guitar.But after that early highlight, COW moves away from such overt pulses. “Siren 33 (Orphee Mirror)” nods to Jean Cocteau’s famous 1950 film and gets built from bowed cymbals, metallic drones and a looping Pop Ambient-style snatch of strings. Like that series, the track just pinwheels in space, content to not evolve. Lush pop-soul strings underpin “5th Dimensions,” but the Orb don’t do much with them aside from add and remove layers of crackle and noise. Smaller pieces like “Sex (Panoramic Sex Heal)” and “7 Oaks” are cut from similar cloth.Trains roar in the distance, harps and bells sparkle, CB radio calls crackle and birds chirp on penultimate track “9 Elms Over River Eno (Channel 9),” in a way that feels like déjà vu. Considering the happenstance samples, the sounds of train travel, crickets and cows, the lush sounds of AM pop reconfigured and abstracted, and the travelogue order of the album (and yes, there apparently is an Eno River in North Carolina) it’s hard to not notice the parallels between this sound palette and the one that comprised Chill Out (which phased the sounds of passing trains and famously looped Elvis Presley’s “In the Ghetto” to hallucinatory effect).Only as Reich-ian pulses and heavier drums kick in near the end of “River Eno” does one feel the tingle of fluffy clouds arising. Where once 43 minutes into an album meant at most three Orb songs, the album abruptly stops here. COW has some of the Orb’s most gentle moments to date, but in eschewing their own classic album and instead oddly reflecting on one from their peers, they fail to get beyond the Ultraworld and the world of Chill Out, at times mimicking little more than some BBC sound effects.\"],[22511,\"Lizzo is having a good year. The ink is dry on her deal with a major label, one of her songs got the silver screen treatment and she’s gracing the airwaves too, as a host of Wonderland—MTV’s new live music program. She found time in between all of this to finish Coconut Oil, a six-track EP that marks her official debut for Nice Life Recording Company, an Atlantic Records imprint.This busy stretch for the Detroit native coincided with an intense period of reckoning for the world at large. Every week brought renewed potential for despair, as images of war, humanitarian crises and police brutality were plastered across our TV, computer and phone screens in stunning high definition. Faced with this seemingly relentless stream of horrible news, and short of going off the grid completely to avoid it, taking time to look after your physical and mental wellbeing is a matter of survival. Coconut Oil is Lizzo’s ode to body positivity, self-love and the trials of getting to the point where you believe you deserve it.The perception of coconut oil as a cure for all of life’s problems has achieved legendary, and therefore meme-able, status. It’s now hailed as a balm to alleviate everything from the pain of heartbreak to the pressure of student debt. As an integral part of many skin and Afro haircare rituals, it has come to represent something very important for black women in particular, who rally around its power to heal from the outside in. From acknowledging this in the EP’s title down to making songs that speak directly to the lived experience of this demographic, Lizzo is both channeling and fuelling the zeitgeist under which black women’s oft-ignored specificities are being celebrated in popular culture.In some circles the substance that inspired the EP’s name is used with an almost religious fervor. Lizzo honors this sentiment by taking us to church on the title track, crooning “I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was some coconut oil” against a backdrop of organs. It’s a light-hearted retelling of the journey from youthful insecurity (“I remember back, back in school, when I wasn’t cool”) through to hard-earned confidence, with a nod to the experiences and people that helped shape her along the way – especially her mother. Saved for last in the play order, “Coconut Oil” the most reserved and lyrically modest effort on what’s otherwise a very spirited collection. Over the five songs leading up to it, she pushes to the upper reaches of her vocal range, quite literally belting out her own praises with no hint of shyness.The twinkly opening keys of “Scuse Me” give you just enough time to prepare for the impossibly long bass drops and frantic drum sequences to follow, over which she explains just how much she’s feeling herself. Her pre-chorus line “Feeling like a stripper when I’m looking in the mirror, I be slapping on that ass getting thicker and thicker” plays out like a 2016 rewrite of “Oops (Oh My)” turned up to 11.Two promotional singles from earlier this year found a home on Coconut Oil. “Good As Hell,” featured in the latest installment of the Barbershop series, is brassy encouragement for anyone who is worn out from giving more than they get in a relationship. “Phone” is pure MPC and bassline magic, on which the existential dread of losing both your cellular device (“Where the hell my phone?”) and your friends at the club is somehow turned into a danceable moment.Weaving in and out of sung and rap verses on all but one song, it’s clear that Lizzo feels at ease in both of those spaces. Still, the EP as a whole doesn’t reach its sweet spot melodically. The mambo-inspired horns on opener “Worship,” give way to a chorus that drifts into show tune territory, leading into two very different syncopated dance rhythms before getting to “Deep.” If neither “Phone” nor “Good As Hell” brought you to this EP, “Deep” would likely be quick to standout as a club-ready dance tune with its soukous-inflected guitar riffs. There is nothing wrong with these elements individually, but it’s hard to know which thread to follow when they’re all packed into a running time of under twenty minutes.Lizzo’s career and sound have already been through many transformations: from rocker, to electro-soul crooner, to rapper and singer by way of on-air talent. Perhaps Coconut Oil works best when considered as a statement of intent – an inventory of all the things she’s good at, and a testing ground for how best to blend them in the future.\"],[22493,\"For a brief pocket of time in the beginning of the 2010s, spoken-word poetry was surprisingly prevalent in music. Spanning Jamie xx’s remixes of Gil Scott-Heron, to Brian Eno and the poet Rick Holland’s Drums Between the Bells, and the lowbrow masterpiece of Paris Hilton’s “Drunk Text,” this little bumper crop did not go unnoticed: The Guardian clunkily called the shared musical space “poetronica.” While reading poetry over sweet-toned beats always felt kitschy, there is something undeniable linking the two forms: As the poet Jodi Ann Bickley has said, the forms are exceptional at creating a sense of “place,” and both inherently are dictated by a primordial sense of rhythm.One of the most successful and captivating practitioners of spoken-word electronic has been Marie Davidson, one half of the Montreal coldwave duo Essaie Pas. Her two previous solo releases (Perte D'Identité and Un Autre Voyage) mingled gothic ambient music, poetic repetitions, and analog synthpop to great success. Her work has never felt campy, but is darkly rendered, probing, and redolent of Lizzy Mercier Descloux. In her third solo release, Adieux Au Dancefloor, Davidson presents a project that indicates exciting and near-exponential growth in her ability as a writer and producer. The project started to gestate last year, after Davidson returned to Montreal from Berlin, having completed a recent European tour with Essaie Pas. She says that the music was informed by a dualistic relationship to “dance music and club culture”; a fascination and disgust that emerged after the conclusion of her trip. “Touring and playing live late at night can lead to destructive habits and behaviors,” she said. Adieux Au Dancefloor (“Farewell to the Dancefloor”) is the result of redirecting the chaotic energy of constant clubbing towards creative ends. In line with it’s inspiration, Adieux Au Dancefloor is much more informed by club music than her previous releases. The sounds and their presentation are pleasing and spacious and and made to appeal to a dancefloor sensibility, aligning it with Essaie Pas’ recent release Demain Est Une Autre Nuit, a fantastically shadowy and phantasmagoric album of analog dance music.In the album’s opening moment, “Dedicate My Life,” Davidson conjures the beautifully unhinged spirit of Throbbing Gristle, with pointillist synths, relentless drums, and needles of heated noise that recall the profane and industrial heartbeat of “Hot on the Heels of Love.” When Davidson begins reciting her poem, she introduces the album’s narrator, an empowered, effortlessly cool, feminist badass. “People ask me\\/What I do with my time\\/Listen\\/I dedicate my life,” Davidson says. At one point her voice disappears beneath the swirling noise, as a tempo change provokes ecstatic body motion. It might feature a poet as its narrator, but this is not a \\\\\"contemplative\\\\\" album; this is dynamic, kinetic music wants to provoke a flurry of action.The album retains this speedball excitement as it weaves it’s way through instrumental tracks and poems in both English in French. In tracks like “Denial,” Davidson explores the upper limits of her analog gear, pumping up the pace and pulsations of her synth to a point that finds the song almost unravel on itself. It reminded me of the chaotic beauty of watching viral videos of washing machines self-destructing.Even in its drapery of fog and acid, Adieux Au Dancefloor consistently finds feel-good moments. Take for example, “Good Vibes,” which lifts up Davidson’s call to arms (“This song is dedicated to all the jealous people”) with a pleasantly jarring and rough-hewn synth loop. Or “Naive to the Bone,” the album’s funniest and most writerly number with lines like “Let me picture my future, a large room where you can hear the silence\\/No space for arrogance, no pain in my chest\\/Just the beating of my heart” conjuring Anne Sexton. She also flashes a sharp and quotidian sense of humor, castigating an unnamed enemy’s fashion choices: “In The Middle Ages, people used to wear clocks, it's 2016, get real.”  The album culminates in its title track, which gathers together her wit into an unreal screed and personal exorcism of nightlife’s inescapable vapidity. Singing in French, she starts the song by painting a hellish scene: “A stranger taking a picture of himself with his phone\\/A girl lying on the floor, her eyes rolled upwards.” She shrouds the burn of her words with the most exciting and seedy sounds of the album. It smartly distorts the content of her poem with the sensation her music produces, making those lines seem even more affecting. As the song reaches it’s at end, Davidson says “There are no more reasons to celebrate\\/Who will pity me in the morning if I lose my mind?,” presenting a hard question for the brain already sapped of serotonin. Throughout Adieux Au Dancefloor, Davidson constantly turns these moments of powerful doubt and bad mojo into joyous dance music, making the album a strenuous mental and physical exercise. The music here presents a criticism of the very place it is meant to live. What Davidson does here is not just a piece of music, or a set of poems, but a critical dialogue framed as a brooding electronic epic.  \"],[22339,\"Rock tropes form the language that Philadelphia’s Purling Hiss speaks, and they’ve been fluent for a while. Most of their songs cook up repetitive riffs, three-chord melodies, and simple lyrics sung in both impassioned shouts and cool monotones. At his best, frontman and songwriter Mike Polizze—who began Purling Hiss as a solo project—simultaneously embraces, tweaks, and subverts all kinds of vintage garage, punk, and grunge moves. When his band hits that sweet spot, you feel like you’ve heard all this stuff before, but somehow not exactly like this. There’s not much subversion on High Bias, Purling Hiss’s sixth album. Their music has always exuded a retro aura, but this is their most classic-rock record so far. In a few instances, it sounds like the band is role-playing: take the convincing Ramones costumes they don in “Get Your Way,” with Polizze stoically singing about “the rock‘n’roll boogie woogie twist and shout.” But even at their most homage-heavy, Purling Hiss muster enough distinctive personality to evade mimicry. And what High Bias lacks in surprise, it makes up for in hooks.During the album’s best stretches, the hooks seem to never stop. The soaring “Fever” and the revving “Ostinato Musik” feel spacious enough to drive an 18-wheeler through, while the acoustic-tinted “Follow You Around” evokes a ’60s nugget filtered through stoner vibes (and, again, Ramones nostalgia). Hints of the ’90s surface in the hard-grunge riffs of “3000 AD,” delivered with conviction rather than slack distance. In fact, Polizze’s devotion to his material is stronger than ever on High Bias. He’s always been assured and committed, but here he’s settled fully into his skill set, like a craftsman whose easy mastery hides the years of work it took to get there.High Bias does have its share of sweat, though. Hard-cranked tunes like “Notion Sickness” and “Pulsations” speed and blast like motorcycles stuck above 65. The strain in those tracks can be exhausting, but the sturdiness is impressive, especially in Polizze’s brief but combustive solos. The same goes for “Everybody in the USA,” which engages in another rock trope: the extended, album-ending jam, culminating in six minutes of instrumental amp-burning. That track might test the patience of anyone not already inclined towards Purling Hiss’s well-versed rock devotion, but if you’re happy to ride some riffs into the sunset, High Bias is a worthwhile trip.\"],[22490,\"Since Chromatics failed to release Dear Tommy on Valentine’s Day of 2014, the long-awaited follow up from Johnny Jewel and co. has become an elusive white whale for a particular fan of tastefully sleazy electronic music. It’s a genre that finds the sun slowly setting upon itself, and with every passing day, the audience for Jewel’s ribald mutant synth-pop gets older. Each hint that has emerged in the last two years—in the form of four songs all released without warning—has been tantalizing, yet tinged with bittersweet nostalgia. Two new videos have arrived since this summer alone, but Dear Tommy remains an enigma.The release of Jewel’s latest film score, for Belgian director Fien Troch’s nihilist coming-of-age tale, Home, now feels overshadowed by the media cycle and speculation that Dear Tommy has produced by virtue of its absence. Nonetheless, filmmakers have recently seemed to swarm Jewel. The attention has come in the wake of 2012’s Chromatics LP Kill for Love and the larger profile it has helped Jewel cultivate, as well as his mostly-scrapped 2011 soundtrack to Nicolas Winding Refn’s Drive, which still managed to contain Jewel’s spectral presence.On the whole, though, Jewel’s film music has been hit or miss. In 2012, Themes For an Imaginary Film (his unused Drive music) was an engrossing and steamy soundscape. His 2015 Lost River soundtrack, meanwhile, was an overly luxuriant accessory to an otherwise comically bad film. This score for Home, by comparison, is strangely mild-mannered.Due to its minimal distribution, U.S. audiences are not likely to see Torch’s film. In a way (and not unlike Jewel’s other filmic projects) this 41-minute, 14-track score stands alone as a musical experience, a whisper of new music from Jewel’s multiple projects, though a portion of it recycles old songs. Two of the Chromatics tracks, “Paradise” and “Running from the Sun,” originally appeared on Kill for Love. The former was lightly edited into a more dance oriented version, and the latter seems completely unchanged. Of the new music you do get: there is one new Chromatics song, three Symmetry songs, and eight ambient tracks credited to Jewel. These three different sides of Jewel are only diffusely connected. It creates a disjointed listen, as if two experiences are stacked on top of each other rather than organized for flow or logic.“Magazine,” the sole new Chromatics track, is disappointingly one of their least interesting songs in a very long time. It lacks any of the sordid thrill, the noir funk, and essential sense of foreboding of their past releases. “Magazine” is surprisingly beige as far as Italo-disco goes. Even if the song unmistakably owns Chromatics’ sonic identity—slithering drum machine, glacial synths, greasy guitars—it comes off as hollow or caricatured. This is magnified in the film, where it is used early on to set the scene for groups of disaffected teenagers hanging out near a high school, making out, staring into the abyss of their iPhone screens.The Symmetry songs are all instrumental genre exercises, with a slightly more focused mood. “The Alligator” is Jewel’s take on trap or EDM, and sounds like what Mike WiLL Made-It might produce if all he listened to was Giorgio Moroder. “The Magician” is perfectly melodramatic rave music, and “Countdown” is classic opiated fare from Jewel. Once the door closes on the Chromatics\\/Symmetry side of the soundtrack, and Jewel’s solo work takes over, the album suddenly swerves into agreeable and bland territory.Jewel’s eight ambient works are mostly forgettable. They are all tightly constructed, brooding, atmospheric—the kind of music that is popular and ubiquitous for indie dramas of all stripes and colors. In that way, these utilitarian songs perfectly accomplish what they are supposed to do in the film: compliment, render, and foreground narrative. But any expectation of the shock of the new immediately fails to be met. That is not to say there aren’t highlights from this cluster of songs. “Remorse,” the best of these, is four minutes of gothic drums and gaseous hisses that that recall Ben Frost. Other moments, like “Trust,” favorably recall Stars of the Lid. Overall, the situation that this soundtrack generates is similar to the disappointment you might feel after opening up a pack of baseball cards. As you flip through the haul, there is the potential for something rare to pop up, but more likely than not, you’ll have seen it all before.\"],[22404,\"The Wiggin family of Fremont, New Hampshire were an all-American bunch. Father Austin Wiggin Jr. and Mother Annie were blessed with a lovely brood of six: Two boys, Robert and Austin III, and four daughters, Dorothy (Dot), Betty, Helen, and Rachel. However, in Austin’s eyes, his traditional-seeming clan was anything but—their existence was actually a case of cosmic circumstance. When Austin was a young child, his palmistry-practicing mother predicted that he would marry a strawberry blonde woman, have two sons after she died, and that his daughters would form a successful music group. Having witnessed the first two prophecies come true, Austin decided to give his preordained fate a little push. In the mid-1960s he pulled his three eldest teenage daughters, Dot, Betty, and Helen, out of school, equipped them with guitars and drums, and dubbed them the Shaggs.Though Austin had no real musical experience, he took quite naturally to the role of a Svengali-type manager. He demanded that the Shaggs practice all day in the family basement: While he was at work, when he came home, after dinner, and occasionally before bed (sometimes, this pre-bedtime practice was replaced by calisthenics). The Shaggs would play a song over and over and over again, until Austin deemed it perfect (or as close to the level of perfection an untrained group could reach). As Dot later explained in Songs in the Key of Z, “He directed. We obeyed. Or did our best.” Wanting to get the girls while their sound was “hot,” in 1969 after about five years of practice, Austin dragged the Shaggs to Fleetwood studio in Revere, Massachusetts, to record their first album, Philosophy of the World.“Even if you took a few years and learned all the chords you’d still have a limited number of options,” Half Japanese’s David Fair writes in his brief manifesto “How to Play Guitar.” “If you ignore the chords your options are infinite and you can master guitar playing in one day.” Even though they barely learned any chords, it seems safe to say that even after countless hours of practice the Shaggs never mastered their instruments. But the essence of Philosophy of the World lies within Fair’s words: that technical limitations can equal musical freedom.By all accounts, the Wiggin sisters’ voices are painful—not nails-on-a-chalkboard unlistenable, but bizarre, like hearing early Animal Collective for the first time. Dot and Betty’s guitars are cheap and off-key. Helen’s drums have no consistency and jump from rumbling rolls to soft and stuttering taps for no apparent reason. The Shaggs are literally the sound of teenagers without any real training who are suddenly tasked with creating pop tunes. “It just came out of my head,” Dot explains in the reissue’s liner notes. “When I wrote the lyrics, I already had the way the song was supposed to be, the tune of it, so then I matched the melody with words and then chords with melody.” As such, the guitars follow the warbling vocals note-for-note, and since each accented word receives its own unique pitch, the plucking is acrobatic and difficult to follow. Rarely is there a moment on Philosophy of the World that feels cohesive. Yet, even though each sister moves at her own tempo, somehow the structure never falls apart. There’s something intriguing about the noises the Shaggs create and the way they become catchy; chaos is negated in the same way that after enough contemplation the violent splatters of a Jackson Pollock painting become calming.As the voice of the band, Dot wrote about the things she knew, the life her sisters lived, the world they dreamed of discovering. The Philosophy of the Shaggs, as explained via the chorus of the album’s self-titled opener (“you can never please anybody in this world”) is one of moxie, faith, and pragmatic emotional compromise. While the longings of other girl groups of the late 1960s were also marked by melancholy, an unsettling sense of darkness permeates the Shaggs’ songs, especially when one considers the forceful conditions under which they were created. Perhaps if the same lyrics were Spectorized and accompanied by some claps or twinkly piano they would come off as less nervous. But instead, the combination of the Shaggs’ creaky chords, jumpy vocals, and irregular melodies ring an alarm that something is off. Take “Who Are Parents,” a creepy call-and-response ditty about the righteousness of guardians, the ones who really care, the ones who are always there. “Some kids think their parents are cruel\\/Just because they want them to obey certain rules,” Dot sings, sternly beseeching other youths to stick to their morals. “Then they start to lean from the ones who really care\\/Turning, turning from the ones who will always be there.” “Who Are Parents” fails as a family anthem and instead is a haunting example of the pressure and fear Austin instilled in his daughters.Most of the Shaggs’ lyrics reflect their strict upbringing and ensuing social anxiety. On “I’m So Happy When You’re Near,” Dot and Betty unite to sing about the sadness that arrives when the song’s subject departs. In between verses, the Shaggs’ countless hours of practice truly shine with some intricate guitar work. Shortly after, “Sweet Thing” delivers a tale of woe and is perhaps the strongest display of anger the Wiggin sisters  muster. “You used to make me happy\\/Now you make me sad\\/You’ve told me many lies\\/I’ve never told you one,” Dot points out in the same, even voice used throughout the record, even though she’s sharing a deep moment of betrayal. The pain truly shines when Betty squawks “Hurt you, hurt you,” like a stuck toy. Out-of-tune, sharp moments like these could be overlooked as amateur, but they are really the rare occasions when fervor seeps out.The Shaggs’ introspection is best explored on “Things I Wonder” and “Why Do I Feel?.” The former slogs along with the simple chorus “There are many things I wonder\\/There are many things I don’t\\/It seems as though the things I wonder the most\\/Are the things I never find out.” Even from reading those words in your head, they are so clearly jumbled, so unbalanced. Beneath Dot and Betty’s stiff, severely accented vocals, Helen’s drums rumble and clang. Yet these elements are so unchanging that “Things I Wonder” becomes hypnotic. “Why Do I Feel?” is less repetitive and rather than just discussing the unknown, the Shaggs seem to be truly wondering. “Why do I feel the way I feel?,” they ask, drawing out each word with longing. “My Pal Foot Foot” has become a Shaggs anthem of sorts: a drawing of the legendary cat adorned the cover of a 1988 compilation album as well as many arms and legs of ardent fans. Their clumsy search for a roaming cat sounds like it is being delivered at the edge of a cliff. “Foot Foot…,” one of the sisters nervously murmurs. It’s sing-songingly charming in the way that nursery rhymes are until you realize the dark underlying message. All of this considered, there are perhaps only two purely innocent songs on Philosophy of the World, the radio-worshipping  “My Companion” and “It’s Halloween.” “It’s Halloween” and its talk of ghouls seemingly could have been sung by the Peanuts gang three years earlier in “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.”When Austin died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1975, the Shaggs immediately disbanded and resumed normal lives, working blue-collar jobs and starting families. “We figured when we ended it and we went on with our own lives, that that was the end of it,” recalls Dot. “That was one life, and now another.” But destiny had other plans for the Wiggin girls, who had yet to become the popular group of their grandmother’s prophecy. Even though 900 of the 1000 copies of Philosophy of the World produced disappeared immediately, the record managed to fall into the hands of influential obscure music fans who were drawn to discordant sounds produced by three sisters from New Hampshire. By 1980, new fans were introduced to Philosophy of the World thanks to a reissue campaign led by the band NRBQ.The Shaggs were quickly embraced by the exact opposite audience Austin desired: the longhaired avant-garde intellectuals. Listeners were amazed by this music that seemed ahead of its time, and totally different than what one might expect if they handed three teenage girls instruments with little instruction. The Shaggs pre-dated the trend of making music that sounds untrained; they probably would have hated Beat Happening. “I don’t know anything about music,” Captain Beefheart told Lester Bangs in 1980. But the big difference between Beefheart and the Shaggs comes down to intention. Whereas Don Van Vliet was improvising and experimenting, the Shaggs were simply surviving.On top of the musical strangeness, there are the universal sentiments that the Wiggin girls capture, their juvenile dreams and desires illustrated as intimate. Big ideas become small and accessible in their voices: Don’t you remember when you felt scared, sad, or alone? So do the Shaggs, and it’s comforting to relate. Kurt Cobain called Philosophy of the World one of the top five records of all time—what did he hear in the Shaggs? Perhaps he was entranced by what he saw as raw innocence.But in truth, contemporary listeners and critics will never identify with the Shaggs because their words are not for us.Since Philosophy of the World became a cult classic in the ’70s and ’80s, critics have been quick to label the Shaggs as outsider musicians. But if the outsider music genre is meant to be the logical counterpart to outsider art, the Shaggs do not quite qualify. Yes, their bumpy music pays no attention to conventional practices, yes, by all means they are amateur. But they had certainly heard mainstream music like Herman’s Hermits and sources differ on whether or not they received music lessons. Outsider art, and therefore music, is meant to come from an undisturbed place. “Here we are witness to the artistic operation in its pristine form, something unadulterated, something reinvented from scratch at all stages by its maker, who draws solely upon his private impulses,” said Art Brut founder Jean Dubuffet.The Shaggs were forced to make music by a father who physically removed them from school. While the Shaggs may have been expressing genuine emotions, it was not of their free will. “It’s just something we had to do,” one sister recalls in an interview with the BBC. One might consider the anecdote that the Shaggs would occasionally sneak away from practice to a nearby lake and then rush home as if they had been rehearsing. Calling them outsiders negates the trauma that is deeply rooted within their music. Austin emphasized over and over how “pure” the Shaggs were, how they were “unaffected by outside influences.” But their purity is that of claustrophobia. Outsider artists are expected to possess a degree of unconsciousness that acts as a path into the profound psyche. But the Wiggin sisters were self-conscious teenagers. Their peers tossed soda cans at them. Even though Dot’s lyrics clearly come from a significant place within (her adolescent anxieties) the difference is that of writing a daily journal to share with a classroom of peers versus writing a diary entry before bed.If new or old fans wish to experience a pure version of the Shaggs, check out 1982’s Shaggs’ Own Thing, a collection of unreleased recordings and covers. Shaggs’ Own Thing finds the Wiggin girls to be playful and free of anxiety, perhaps because there’s no clear-cut purpose behind the recordings. The covers (which include versions of the Carpenters) are faithful, graceful even. It’s a drastic shift from Philosophy, which comes off as even more abrasive and awkward in comparison. But Philosophy of the World is the realest version of the Shaggs, flaws and force in full-view. A teenage symphony this is not.\"],[22372,\"As this compilation gets underway, with the Broadway Dance Band's big-band highlife number “Go Modern,” the first thing you notice is the enveloping ambient charm of the recording, which sounds closer to a 78-RPM record from the 1940s than the mid-’60s document that it actually is. The next thing you notice is that the guitar and the horns are out of tune with one another—just one of several small touches that give Coming Home its distinct personality, especially in its first half.A two-disc retrospective that touches on several phases of Ghanaian vocalist Pat Thomas’ career, Coming Home presents Thomas fronting over a half-dozen different bands. Inspired at an early age by the likes of Nat King Cole, Miriam Makeba, and Stevie Wonder, Thomas was a more raw-edged singer and can be heard pushing the mic to distortion often on this set as he offers his own version of a Sam Moore-style croon.Just as significantly, the sequencing retraces Thomas’ long-running musical relationship with guitarist\\/arranger\\/bandleader Ebo Taylor. Instrumental in Thomas’ career getting off the ground, Taylor had already established himself with the Broadway Dance Band for almost a decade before giving Thomas his break as the band’s lead vocalist. Taylor and Thomas fell into a comfortable creative rapport almost instantly, with Taylor writing the music but also coming up with song titles for Thomas to write lyrics for. The pair have worked on and off ever since (as captured most recently by Thomas & Kwashibu Area Band’s self-titled album from 2015). Aside from Taylor, the different groupings of musicians on Coming Home occupy the spotlight almost as much as Thomas does.In the mid- to late-20th century, as African societies engaged in complex dances with post-colonialism and modernity, it was no coincidence that new strains of music began to sprout rapidly throughout the continent. A key aspect of the creative surges that swept through Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and elsewhere in the ‘60s and ‘70s was the willingness of homegrown musicians to embrace influences from the Western Hemisphere that owe their existence to Africa in the first place.Of course, Coming Home reflects this dynamic, as Thomas and company navigate the confluence of highlife, swing jazz, Latin jazz, Afrobeat, psychedelic rock, reggae, funk, and disco. At times, the results veer a tad too close to ripoffs. The Pat Thomas and Marijata track “Brain Washing,” for example, sounds like an uninspired cover band trying to concoct a mashup of Janis Joplin’s “Piece of My Heart” with Procol Harum’s “A Whiter Shade of Pale.” Not only does the Marijata track come off as naive, it contains virtually no trace of the environment it was created in. There are other moments when Thomas’ choice to sing in his native Akan dialects of Fante and Twi isn’t enough on its own to truly set the music apart. Luckily, this turns out not the case on most of the album’s 23 tracks. In fact, Coming Home includes four other tunes by Marijata that demonstrate the group’s range. All of the bands included here—Ogyatanaa Show Band, the Black Berets, the Sweet Beans, and The Big ‘7’—wear their influences on their sleeve, but they also manage to spice them up just enough. On “Revolution,” for instance, the Sweet Beans subtly re-invent reggae as a more limber, light-footed form, the song’s slippery bass line immediately recognizable as somehow more “African” than Caribbean.Likewise, on “Set Me Free,” the Sweet Beans hint at but don’t quite dip all the way into Latin rhythms and horn textures, choosing instead to stay in a kind of limbo between Latin jazz and ragtime, with a snaking saxophone melody that betrays the music’s Ghanaian roots. It is at these moments, where the music doesn’t quite plant both feet in any one style, when Coming Home sounds most fresh. In fact, some of the combinations that Thomas and these bands come up with suggest that these musics are still fertile ground for new combinations.The contrasts between the two discs are sharp, as disc one focuses on the ’60s and ’70s while disc two documents Thomas’ work as an exponent of the burger-highlife movement that took off in Germany in the ’80s. And, sure, the drum machine on the more modern track “Gyae Su (1)” speaks to its time period, but for the most part the second disc lacks the heavy recording coloration—and spunk—of the earlier material.On the other hand, on tracks such as the nearly 15-minute lament “Mewo Akoma,” Thomas’ maturity shines through in his lyrics about familial estrangement. Appropriately enough, the twinkling guitar that defines highlife music gets traded in here for a significantly more subdued line that matches the song's weariness.A mixed bag by definition, Coming Home could nevertheless have been sequenced to play more like an album and less like a guided tour. Of course, as a guided tour it inspires the listener to dig deeper into not only Thomas’ work, but the stylistic and cultural origins of his music. Which is to say: it succeeds.\"],[22411,\"In the UK, they’ve gotten dance music down to an exact science. Just listen to an artist like Duke Dumont or Disclosure: From the methodical arrangements to the meticulous sound design, every element is perfectly deployed to ensure maximum dancefloor impact and maximum earworm potential. The decade’s reigning blend of pop melodies and ’90s house tropes is lush, polished, and it sounds expensive—which is ironic for a decade in which the music industry has cratered and actual nightclubs are increasingly gentrified out of business. Still, fantasy is a hell of a drug.Dusky haven’t had the chart success of Disclosure or Dumont, but they represent a similar impulse. Alfie Granger-Howell and Nick Harriman got their start in the late ’00s as Solarity, recording bright, melodic progressive house for the trance trio Above & Beyond’s Anjunadeep label. As they moved toward a darker, deeper sound, they adopted a new alias at the opposite end of the spectrum: Dusky. Their career until now has constituted a search for the perfect fusion of underground affect, big-room punch, and just enough heart-on-sleeve emotion to make their productions sound weightier than the club tracks that bookend them. It’s safe to say they perfected that mix on tracks like “Yoohoo” and “Love Taking Over,” both marked by the duo’s characteristic balance of hard and soft: While drums and bassline thump you sternly in the chest, echo-soaked loops of vocals swirl like victory pennants over a smoldering battlefield, at once triumphant and sad. So here, on their second album, the question becomes: Where now? To answer that, they follow the same course as a million dance long-players before: a sentimentalist hodge-podge designed to prove that their mettle extends beyond the dancefloor.You may have already figured out how this story goes. Soaring, percussion-free intro and ambient interludes; wavering falsetto vocals; slow, sensitive closing song—all the tropes of the grown-up electronic album are here. So are the requisite guest appearances, beginning with an awkward Wiley cameo, “Sort It Out Sharon.” It’s an obvious nod to the broad sweep of British rave history—the intro is a nearly note-for-note rewrite of 808 State’s “Pacific State”—and perhaps there’s something novel about putting a grime MC over a Balearic house beat. But Wiley feels hemmed in by all those steady kick drums, and the rest of the track, with bass like a Foley artist’s thunder sheet, can’t escape the shadow of influences like Joy Orbison and Boddika. The Gary Numan feature “Swansea,” on the other hand, is too reverent: A slow, chugging, gothy number with Numan in peak warble, it offers no compelling reason to listen to it instead of virtually any song from Numan’s own back catalog.The album isn't without its moments: The genuinely thrilling “Trough” finds a new sweet spot somewhere in between James Holden’s synth flare, M83’s widescreen drama, and the needle-nosed tone clusters of the Cure’s Seventeen Seconds. You can hear Granger-Howell’s formal training in composition paying off here, where they stuff every available crevice with harmonies until the spectrum sparkles like diamond pavé. And their finesse comes to the fore in other places as well: the synthesizers in the lumbering “Songs of Phase” flicker like colored flames, and “Tiers” masterfully layers its interlocking synths.The real problem is that their moments of pathos don't often feel earned. The album opens on such a dramatic peak—part ambient come-up, part breast-beating cry into the void—that it leaves little room to progress from there. The close-harmonized vocals of “Tiers” (“Like tears falling,” unless that's supposed to be “Like tiers falling,” which wouldn't make any sense at all—but why title it “Tiers,” then?) are cloying and sticky-sweet, and the same goes for “Long Wait,” whose DNA can be traced back to songs like Radiohead’s “Everything in Its Right Place” and Moderat’s “Bad Kingdom”: the surging strings and Solomon Grey’s pinched wail are simply syrupy. “Marble,” topped with Granger-Howell’s own surprisingly capable falsetto, is actually pretty effective for a downtempo Bon Iver knockoff; freed from the need to move bodies on the dancefloor, it can settle into its melancholy and wallow for a pleasant while.The dancefloor cuts, on the other hand, are torn between competing impulses. After “Yoohoo,” the soaring piano-driven uplift of “Ingrid is a Hybrid” feels pat. “Runny Nose” opens with what I hope is a tongue-in-cheek snapshot of coked-up nightlife philosophizing and shifts into a peak-time techno take on Banco de Gaia’s vague exoticism. And “Songs of Phase,” the toughest, most effective club track on the album, sells itself short by falling back on snippets of an instantly recognizable Ursula Rucker a cappella, sourced from a 1994 King Britt production, that’s been reused in many, many songs over the years. (Budding producers can even get it for themselves on Beatport.) “As I journey deeper inside myself,” she gravely intones, but nothing on the album suggests much in the way of inner quests; Outer, fittingly enough, projects its energies relentlessly outward, broadcasting its emotional content in a way that too often feels heavy-handed. It’s as though Dusky didn't quite trust their listeners to meet them on their own terms. With every laser sweep and strobe burst, you can imagine them anxiously scanning the audience's faces, looking for evidence of rapture and pushing their faders further into the red.\"],[22348,\"Big Star never completed their third album. In fact, it’s likely that the music collected on Omnivore’s triple-disc box set Complete Third was never intended to be a Big Star album. Alex Chilton maintained as late as 2007 that he and drummer Jody Stephens never considered these 1974 sessions a Big Star project, a testament supported by the fact that none of the tapes in Ardent Studios were labeled with name “Big Star.” Instead, they were credited to Alex Chilton alone, Alex & Jody, and Sister Lovers, a punning reference to the fact the pair were dating sisters at the time.  Sister Lovers also provided Rykodisc with a subtitle for these recordings when they issued Third\\/Sister Lovers on CD in 1992, marking the first time a label attempted to seriously piece the puzzle of Big Star Third together. Prior to that, the album came out under a variety of titles—3rd, The Third Album, Big Star’s 3rd: Sister Lovers, Sister Lovers (The Third Album), with the alleged provisional title Beale Street Green remaining the province of bootlegs—all bearing a different track listing, none of which mirrored the test pressing that was unsuccessfully shopped around to labels in 1975.Reissue producer Cheryl Pawelski uses that test pressing as her lodestar on Complete Third, letting it form the foundation of the third disc of final mixes, serving as a culmination to the discs of demos and rough mixes that precede it. A good chunk of these tracks previously appeared on archival releases from Rhino, Big Beat\\/Ace and Omnivore, but 28 debut here. None of these unheard cuts would make much sense on their own release, but they provide crucial pieces of the narrative on a box set that attempts to make sense of sessions that the creators themselves don't quite understand.One thing all participants—Chilton and Stephens, producer Jim Dickinson, Ardent owner\\/producer\\/engineer John Fry—can agree upon is that no official version of Third exists. Dickinson attempted to piece it together for Rykodisc in 1992 but he freely admits that his vision differed from Chilton’s and once this period passed into history Chilton showed no interest in revisiting it. In the liner notes to Complete Third, Ken Stringfellow—the Posies guitarist who was instrumental in ushering the reunited Big Star into the ’90s and 2000s—recalls a time when he and his partner Jon Auer cajoled Chilton to attempt “Kizza Me” at a latter-day reunion show. Once the band kicked off the song at sound check, Alex stood still as a statue, refusing to lay hands on his guitar or sing. By that point Chilton was finished with Third. But as Chris Stamey— a co-leader of the dB’s who helped maintained the Big Star legend in the ’70s as Stringfellow did in the ’90s—notes elsewhere in the liners, there was a time when these were among his “newest and dearest” tunes.Those early demos on the first disc do indeed carry traces of sweetness, particularly in the delicate readings of “Lovely Day,” “Thank You Friends,” “Take Care,” “Jesus Christ,” and “Blue Moon,” all sounding like natural extensions of the folk tunes scattered through the first two Big Star albums, not to mention some of the material Chilton attempted just after leaving the Box Tops. Even the album’s towering triptych of gloom—“Holocaust,” “Nightime,” and “Kanga Roo” (entitled “Like St. Joan” in its first incarnation)—feel brokenhearted rather than desolate. So what happened between these initial readings and the final mixes, which often feel like a fever dream from a man embracing madness? Again, nobody knows for sure, but everybody orbiting Ardent in the mid-’70s agree Chilton was hell bent on self-immolation, bitter at the industry, angry at himself, and involved in a destructive relationship with Lesa Aldridge, his girlfriend and muse who co-wrote “Downs,” an improbably chipper valentine to quaaludes. Jim Dickinson could always spin a yarn, and he invented a tale for Third, determining that the album was all about decomposition—a decay that began with the unraveling of Big Star, spread through the dissolution of the golden age of Memphis music, then taking root at the breakdown of Chilton himself. It’s a good story, one that’s likely true on some level, but it’s also a bit pat, the kind of thing that a producer invents: he’s cobbling together a narrative out of what seems to be a mess. Complete Third presents that purported mess as a whole, offering every known existing recording from the sessions, and, in doing so, it suggests the sessions weren’t quite as chaotic as lore suggests. Certainly, the demos show that Chilton’s songs were fully formed at the start, so it was a deliberate decision on his part to record the songs just as Jody Stephens was learning them. Ardent producer\\/engineer Adam Hill supports this theory: “While the lack of pre-production contributed to the loose feel of the songs, there’s no doubt that Alex was chasing sounds he heard in his head, and he knew when had captured them on tape.” If Chilton was deadset in chasing chaos, Dickinson was his ideal partner. Where John Fry favored precision—fitting for an engineer who ran a studio—Dickinson preferred to let things careen out of control, either because he knew magic came with mistakes or because he couldn't resist mischief. Once Dickinson enters the picture, somewhere around the tail end of the first disc after the initial demos were completed, things start to get weird and heavy. The pivot is a pair of duets between Alex Chilton and Lesa Aldridge, where the pair turn the Beatles’ “I’m So Tired” into a narcotic crawl and pretend to be Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris on “That’s All It Took.” From there, the madness has settled in, so it's no surprise that they stumble through T. Rex’s “Baby Strange” or spend five minutes dicking around on guitar and steel drums dubbed “Pre-Downs”—an indication that the innocence of the initial demos had now curdled. The second disc documents how the sessions started to congeal, the beauty and the bleakness sometimes existing on the same plane, sometimes separating into their own spheres. If there are no great revelations here—the closest is a version of the Velvet Underground’s “After Hours” sung by Lesa, one of many Lou Reed allusions here (another is Alex quoting “Perfect Day” at the start of “I’m So Tired”)—it nevertheless gives an idea of the vibe of the recordings, how it was pitched halfway between madness and intention. Comparing the first disc of Complete Third to the second, and it’s clear that Chilton wanted to create the illusion that everything was spinning out of control.Perhaps Chilton succeeded too well, muddying the barrier between the act and the art. After a while, John Fry pulled the plug. He reached his breaking point when Alex pulled in a drunk off the street to sing on a soused version of Jerry Lee Lewis’ “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On.” Fry claimed later that the sessions turned “perverted,” which might be a reference to run-of-the-mill late-night seediness but might have a deeper meaning: Third perverted the ideals Fry held for Ardent. When he opened the studio, he allowed the British Invasion mavens of Memphis to hone their craft after hours at a cut rate. It’s how Chilton and collaborator Chris Bell developed the crystalline power pop of #1 Record and Radio City—these largely were songs invented in the studio and executed by Fry—and such late night sessions are also how Third came to be, except they came out curdled instead of clear. Fry shopped the album to labels in 1975 in the hopes of recouping some of the money poured into the project. Nobody bit. Lenny Waronker at Warner asked, “I don’t have to listen to that again, do I?” Over at Atlantic, Jerry Wexler claimed “This record makes me feel very uncomfortable.”Wexler was onto something. The bleakest moments of Third remain unsettling, capable of causing existential shivers on a bright, sunny day. Creeping along with no seeming sense of momentum, “Holocaust” and “Kanga Roo” have an inexorable pull—listening to them is like being pulled out to sea on an inescapable undercurrent, utterly impossible to navigate your way back to shore. When paired with the carnivalesque flourish of “Jesus Christ,” the homespun baroque pop of “Stroke It Noel,” the explosive carnality of “Kizza Me” and the woozy sway of “O, Dana,” Third can’t help but suggest that Alex Chilton was losing his grip. The primary gift of Complete Third is to reveal that this was a deliberate performance, not audio verite. Perhaps Third was, as Jim Dickinson claimed, the sound of decomposition. But by presenting the demos, working sessions and final mixes in order, Complete Third makes plain that far from being an unwieldy jumble, Alex Chilton meant to have Third sound as tortured, haunting and beautiful as the darkest moments of the soul. \"],[22391,\"Even just on paper, Heems and Riz MC are perfect foils for one another. Heems is a rapper (and former member of Das Racist) of Indian descent, though his family has roots in Pakistan. Riz is a rapper (and actor increasingly known for his role in HBO's “The Night Of”) of Pakistani descent whose family history can be traced back over the Indian side of the border. Heems hails from Queens, Riz from London. Heems is sharp-witted but raps with a relaxed cadence while Riz spits in the pointed, rapid-fire bursts that characterize grime. The two MCs make for a formidable pair on record, complimenting each other sonically while seeking out the overlap between their perspectives.After testing out their chemistry on a four song EP, Heems and Riz have now committed to the Swet Shop Boys project with the full-length Cashmere. Unlike the Swet Shop EP, which enlisted production from Ryan Hemsworth, Lushlife, and others, Cashmere was entirely helmed by London-based producer Redinho. In keeping with the EP’s sound, Redinho constructs propulsive beats from South Asian samples, providing ample fodder over which the Boys trade verses. Clocking in at just 34 minutes, Cashmere is more focused and consistent than any solo release from either rapper. In the push and pull between their styles, they find a compelling balance between hip-hop and agitprop, arriving at songs that are as enjoyable as they are thought-provoking.Lead single and opener “T5” offers a representative sample: over a screeching shehnai and heavy 808 thuds, the duo catalog the hassles of traveling while brown, skewer euphemistic security speak and situate themselves within the South Asian diaspora (“I run the city like my name’s Sadiq”). “No Fly List” builds a slinky banger around Heems’ hilarious flex, “I’m so fly, bitch\\/But I’m on a no fly list.” “Shottin” weaves tales about the NYPD’s surveillance of mosques using the time-tested format of true crime boom-bap. Only the goofy club number “Tiger Hologram” really falls flat, feeling like an inside joke we’re not privy to and featuring an entire verse where Heems raps with a comical lack of effort—about as funny as salt in a wound to anyone who’s continued to root for him post-Das Racist. While there are a few moments like this on Cashmere, the hungrier Riz usually picks up the slack. And when Heems does show up on these tracks, he sounds effortlessly charismatic, like when he’s twisting rap tropes into worldly new shapes on “No Fly List” (“Sweatsuit on with an Hermès turban\\/Pull up on a bad, brown ting out in Durban”).While both rappers excel at making politics feel personal, Riz comes across as the more academic one, or as he puts it, “Rizzy speaks like Wikileaks investigations.” He raps passionately, though often from a remove, and peppers his lines with citations. For instance, on “T5,” he reaches all the way back to The Iliad to critique anti-refugee fear mongering, though he still manages to clown on less-woke rappers in the same breath (“We’re militant\\/You’re on a Milli Vanilli vibe”). Heems, meanwhile, takes a more personal tack, empathetically sliding into different perspectives as often as he leverages his own. He delights in erasing the post-colonial line between the Indian and Pakistani identities, tossing his New York rapper bonafides into the blender for good measure. On “Phone Tap,” he’s “Pakistani with a pack,” while in “Shottin,” he’s rocking a “Yankee hat with the kufi on top.” When Heems speaks from his own perspective, it’s often on issues that hit closer to home: racial profiling, tense interactions with authorities or outright racism (“Used to call me curry\\/Now they cook it in they kitchen”).This is heavy stuff and as fun as it can be, Cashmere is an unabashedly political record, careening from one geopolitical issue to the next the way that most rap albums treat boasts. Ultimately, though, its most impactful moments lie in the simple act of representation. Album highlight “Zayn Malik” acknowledges as much: behind its clever punning (“Look, Zayn Malik’s got more than 80 virgins on him\\/There’s more than one direction to get to paradise”) lies a sincere desire to symbolize something (Heems’ aspirational quip “I am a college dorm room poster”). Malik is invoked as more than just a punchline here: alongside M.I.A., he’s been among the first South Asian celebrities to represent something more than a threat, egghead or other in western pop culture. The Swet Shop Boys seek to further broaden our understanding, an ambition that’s right there in the title. To Westerners, cashmere is a luxury textile; to South Asians, it’s the site of a violent territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that hinges on questions of identity. It’s a perfect title for a project that blurs the lines between all of these perspectives, that stunts as much as it elucidates, and which ties up all of these messy ideas into a refreshingly expansive vision of South Asian identity.\"],[22410,\"Ewan Smith’s style of house music often seems to belong to everywhere and nowhere at once. Smith—aka Youandewan—hails from Yorkshire but is based, like so many of his peers, in Berlin, and his productions mirror the way that the house and techno of the 21st century have long since pulled up stakes. It’s not that there are no longer any local signatures in dance music, but they don’t tend to stay in one place for long. Sounds dreamed up in one place soon slosh back and forth between cities and scenes like volatile ocean currents.Since he began putting out records in 2009, Youandewan’s music has variously shown the influence of Chicago, Detroit, New York, Berlin, Bristol, and London, along with his native north of England. Moodymann’s fogged-up sample soul; Phuture’s wriggly 303s; the Burrell Brothers’ cool pads—you can hear all of those vintage elements darting through Smith’s tunes. He also draws on more contemporary sounds: Levon Vincent’s scuffed reductions, skipping grooves indebted to UK garage and Thomas Melchior, and the airy vocals that have decorated so much UK bass ever since “Hyph Mngo.” Sometimes it seems that he’s not simply absorbing these influences, but reverse-engineering them: Just compare N.Y. House’n Authority’s classic 1989 tune “Apt 3A” with Youandewan’s “Alright Son,” from 2014, which blurs the line between homage and cover version. At its best, though, his music gives the impression of an artist using a dog-eared archive as the springboard to more personal expressions.There’s always been a melancholy cast to Smith’s music, and that’s especially true on his debut album. There Is No Right Time focuses the emotional content of his singles into a concentrated form. We’re told the bulk of the songs have their roots in a lonely winter a few years back, after a rough breakup and a move to Berlin, and you can believe it: It’s easy to imagine Smith sitting bundled up next to the space heater in his home studio, translating the rivulets of rain trickling down the windows into the brooding piano melody of “Time to Leave,” a despondent hip-hop instrumental that sounds like it’s been rescued from a water-damaged box of memories he regrets having opened.Taking inspiration from artists like Four Tet and Leon Vynehall, Smith has stepped up his sound design—a rich mixture of synthesizers, scratchy samples, and physical instruments like electric guitar and a drum kit—and he explores a broader-than-usual range of tempos and rhythms. In addition to his habitual deep house, we hear sluggish boom-bap, snapping electro, and, on the standout “Be Good to Me Poly,” even rolling drums patterned after jungle’s signature groove. That range underscores the fact that this isn’t really a club album; as a collection of evocative, daydreamy mood pieces, it’s better suited to evenings in and weekends on the couch, to packing bowls and thumbing the morning paper.It’s actually a more diverse LP than it seems at first, despite his foregrounding of forlorn melodies and wistful atmospheres. The album’s back half is particularly active. Sleek and energetic, “Earnest Kelly” mixes up Metro Area-style electronic disco with Japanese new age atmospheres. The quick-stepping “Left on Lucy” reshapes similar sounds, like those DX7 chimes and flutes, into the kind of optimistic anthem that sunrise beach raves were invented for. “Something Keeps Me Real Quiet” is a Smallville-styled romp through the insides of a snow globe that smartly offsets its twinkling keyboards with gruff, overdriven drums and bass. Even the closing “4D Anxiety,” despite its languid tempo and shuffling beat, sneaks in a playful boogie groove borrowed from Floating Points’ early singles.There’s no shortage of highlights, really: The silvery accents on “Be Good to Me,” a tune that sounds a little like a jazz-funk Radiohead cover; the delicate synth and guitar counterpoint of the brisk, snapping “Waiting for L”; and especially the all-encompassing swirl and searching chord changes of “Our Odyssey.” They’re all evidence of Smith’s remarkable production talent and also, more importantly, his expressive sensibility. The album’s only real flaw has less to do with the uniformity of its mood than the uniformity of its structures. No matter the style, tempo, or instrumentation, Smith’s tracks—nothing here ever quite makes the leap from “track” to “song”—all develop the same way. They begin with a ruminative loop and then take on new layers until, some imperceptible peak having been reached, they start slimming down again. The denouement is as gentle as the buildup, and while it may make for profoundly enveloping listening, heard enough times in a row, it leaves you wanting something different: something jarring, something jagged, something to break the flow.It’s a tough thing to ask; Smith’s album is so carefully and tastefully balanced, a sudden wrong move could ruin the mood. But as anyone who has lived through a cold, despondent winter in a strange city can tell you, every now and then you need something to jerk your head out of the fog. Still, as wistful ruminations go, both on and off the dancefloor, they don’t come much sweeter than this.\"],[22492,\"The music of Emma Ruth Rundle is nearly swallowed by darkness, but Rundle does not seem oppressed by it. Having toured with acts like Deafheaven and Earth, Rundle made her name performing mournful, minor key compositions, swelling with gothic drama. But to classify her music as macabre is to deny its cathartic, even uplifting qualities. On Marked for Death, the follow-up to 2014’s Some Heavy Ocean, Rundle upgrades that album’s gothic folk with a more colorful palette. Here, she strengthens the atmospheric guitar work that comprised her instrumental solo debut, Electric Guitar One, and enlivens her songs with anthemic, weightless choruses. And while her two previous solo releases, as well as her work in the noisy LA trio Marriages, set a precedent for Marked for Death’s more ambitious material, it doesn’t make the record feel any less thrilling. Each of its eight tracks showcase a songwriter testing the limits of her sound and redefining herself in the process.As we have come to expect from Rundle, the lyrics throughout Marked for Death range from devastatingly beautiful to just plain devastating. The album follows a loose narrative about a doomed relationship, touching on themes of hopelessness and mortality. The opening title track introduces two fatalistic lovers, with Rundle asking a series of questions that progresses from “Who else is going to love someone like you that’s marked for death?” to simply, “Who else would ever stay?” In the following track, Rundle is wrestling with the sacrifices of commitment, detailing an inherent power struggle and loss of identity (“I am worthless in your arms\\/But you offer this protection no one else is giving me”). It’s unquestionably heavy material, and, in these two tracks, the music is built to carry the load. The guitars are crushing, approaching shoegaze levels of fuzz, while the rhythm remains slow and insistent. After the lumbering introductory tracks, the tension breaks in “Medusa.” Rundle’s voice, clear and calm, soars like the Cranberries’ Dolores O’Riordan in the song's inscrutable refrain. The album’s finest moments are crafted in this mold, settling on a style of slow-building, otherworldly balladry that invoke the early days of 4AD. In “Heaven,” Rundle’s greatest work yet, she sings over a quietly escalating storm of strings, fingerpicked guitars, and militant percussion. By the time the song climaxes with Rundle bellowing, “I can see fire... I can see in heaven,” you are right there with her. Gorgeous and unsettling,“Heaven” feels like the culmination of all of Rundle's best work, boasting the record’s most gratifying melody as well as its gothiest couplet. “The only church I’ll ever know is in the Earth,” she sings, “The ground below me says ‘Come home now.’” Like Some Heavy Ocean, Marked for Death also closes with a sparse solo piece– just Rundle's voice, electric guitar, and the lo-fi hum of her amplifier. But while Ocean’s “Living With the Black Dog” was a dark admission of hopelessness, “Real Big Sky” feels like a transcendent turning point. Rundle calls back to the lingering question in the album’s opening track (“Who else would ever stay?”), but now finds her narrator faced with new revelations– no longer fearing death, but keeping a light on to welcome it. It’s a staggering performance, with Rundle’s voice alternately quivering and soaring. In the song’s music video, she introduces the track with a grand statement: “I don’t think there’s anything more exhilarating than seeing natural beauty… Seeing something that there aren’t words for.” Marked for Death finds Rundle grappling with elements beyond her control, but she's closer than ever to becoming her own force of nature.\"],[22488,\"Conor Oberst’s music has never sounded lonely. Yes, he’s done catatonically despondent, inconsolable, dejected, maniacal—it's a lot to handle, and yet he’s always been surrounded by friends both local and legendary who believe in his vision, underscoring his status as one of the 21st century’s most mercurial and charismatic songwriters. Arriving almost a month after a comprehensive Bright Eyes boxed set that feels like a headstone for the band, Ruminations is a record like none other in Oberst’s catalog—stunning for how utterly alone he sounds. This is obvious in a technical sense, as there are no goddamn timpani rolls, no boys to keep strummin’ those guitars, just Oberst on harmonica, acoustic and piano with ten songs written during an Omaha winter and recorded in 48 hours. Plenty of folk artists make records like that. But there’s also a loneliness in Ruminations that’s far rare and disturbing—the loneliness one feels after taking stock and wondering if they have a friend left in the world.“When it came time to stand with him, you scattered with the rats,” Oberst spits on “You All Loved Him Once,” a song whose title alone would create an uncomfortable subtext on any of his albums. Most fans assume any Oberst lyric written in the first person has to be about Conor Oberst and he’s acknowledged the “weird betrayal” they express when he fails to meet their expectations. Such was the case on 2014’s Upside Down Mountain, one of his more mildly received LPs. But many wouldn’t even acknowledge its existence to begin with—in late 2013, an anonymous post in XOJane’s comments section metastasized into a serious rape allegation against Oberst that was exposed as a fabrication; but only after a libel suit that quantified the damage to his career and reputation at $1 million (which would have been donated to charity). Oberst had the complaint dismissed after his accuser recanted and apologized, even though his name couldn't truly be cleared; the rash of articles that presumed his guilt are still easy to find and treat his innocence like a minor factual clarification.Oberst does not address this situation directly on Ruminations. He comes close on its opener, imagining himself back in Omaha, sweating through his suit in a courtroom: “It’s a bad dream, I have it seven times a week\\/No, it’s not me\\/But I’m the one who has to die.” The title of this song is “Tachycardia,” which hints at the personal issues Oberst does directly address going forward, mostly the medical and mental maladies that popped up after he moved back to Omaha with his wife—Oberst talks about his blood pressure, therapy, “alkaline produce,” suicidal ideation and a cerebral cyst that sunk his tour behind Desaparecidos’ flamethrowing agit-punk reunion LP Payola.Ruminations is Oberst’s most emotionally legible work since Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, also defined by its similarly cloistered worldview and sonic cohesion. Juxtaposed with the stately, worldly and universally beloved I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning, Digital Ash felt like an “everything must go” clearance of songwriting tropes that sustained Bright Eyes up to 2005 and hadn’t returned since—drugs, casual sex, familial disappointment, mistrust of religion. These all come back in very startling ways on Ruminations, but more importantly, there’s the return of that quaver; the unsteady, hypothermic warble that made him a generational icon during his heyday and had all but disappeared on his more recent recordings.Whereas it was once a very powerful affectation, Oberst sounds genuinely unsettled now—enough so that longtime engineer Mike Mogis told Vulture he was “a little worried” when he heard the demos, and on “Counting Sheep,” Oberst mentions the death of two children before intoning, “I hope it was slow, hope it was painful.” The names are redacted and it’s more disturbing for shifting the focus to the why of Oberst’s lyric rather than the who. Before “Counting Sheep” even gets to that point, it’s already an uncomfortably realistic document of insomnia, Oberst playing its stumbling chords with all thumbs, “gun in my mouth, trying to sleep\\/everything ends, everything has to.”  Because Mogis is involved, Ruminations isn’t lo-fi by any means, but it’s raw. There isn’t a delicately played note here and Oberst’s performance lends a palpable urgency to Ruminations that had been missing from his most recent work, perhaps at the expense of ambition. Ruminations at least makes good on its promise, trying to find connections between Oberst’s latter-day obsession with escaping the mythical construct of Conor Oberst and his prior obsession with living that construct.“I don’t want to feel stuck baby, I just want to get drunk before noon,” Oberst casually announces on “Barbary Coast (Later)”; he also imagines himself as Paul Gauguin and John Muir, only to realize he’s not a painter or the outdoorsy type. He's still Conor Oberst, and throughout Ruminations, day-drunk surrealism is punctured by what he's best at: lacerating assessments of himself. They’re some of the most brutal he’s allowed himself in a decade: “Something dies when a star is born\\/I spread my anger like Agent Orange\\/I was indiscriminate,” Oberst sings on “Next of Kin,” preceded by a devastating portrait of a widower and the man who had to deliver the bad news. And yet, for all of the individual potency of the verses in “Next of Kin,” like much of Ruminations, the loose conceptual bundling doesn’t allow it the same knee-buckling thrust of similarly composed narratives like “Nothing Gets Crossed Out” or “Waste of Paint.”“You All Loved Him Once” almost gets there. A song before it, Oberst admits, “I met Lou Reed and Patti Smith\\/It didn’t make me feel different,” and he spends six verses probing the inevitable disillusion and futility of hero worship. Unless you assume Conor Oberst affords himself the same grandiose self-belief as Kanye West, it seems that half of “You All Loved Him Once” at most, could be considered autobiographical. Some of it is almost certainly about Bernie Sanders or Barack Obama, or even just a friend who’s gotten too successful. But towards the end, some lines ring just too painfully true: “The more and more was put on him, he tried his best to take it on...you all loved him once\\/now he is gone”, he sings, and rather than making Oberst sound entitled, he comes off as someone legitimately disillusioned after an unimaginably awful public ordeal. But in the very next song, he’s gone off to an Irish pub in the East Village, trying to find a friend who’ll drink with him until they get kicked out. He's still Conor Oberst, after all.\"],[22477,\"In 2014, Joyce Manor released a truly amazing pop-punk record called Never Hungover Again, which positioned the Torrance, California foursome as kin to pop-punk greats like Blink-182, Weezer, and Jawbreaker. Like those groups, they share the same penchant for suburban ennui, self-indulgent melancholy (“I hate the way I feel like dying when I’m alone”), and loud anthems cherished by quiet people.But for their fourth record, Cody, Joyce Manor decided to change their process a bit and take a few risks. They replaced drummer Kurt Walcher with Jeff Enzor and teamed up with producer Rob Schnapf, who has worked with Elliott Smith, Guided by Voices, and Saves the Day. They holed up with Schnapf for two months and made a tight, complex record that still manages to cram 10 songs into about 25 minutes. A telling detail is frontman Barry Johnson’s admission that Cody is influenced by Dear Nora, a Portland indiepop project led by Katy Davidson. Though it seems safe to say that very few Joyce Manor fans listen to Dear Nora (maybe they heard the name in a Girlpool song), the former’s newfound affinity for the gentle band is not that much of a surprise: at Cody’s core is a deeper degree of tenderness than they have displayed before.  Joyce Manor’s songs follow a pattern of communicating through brief emotional blasts. In every two-minute story, the stakes are high, and this pushes each track to discover some sort of clarity by the conclusion. On Cody, these realizations are rarely happy, and Joyce Manor ask their fans to follow them to a darker place than before. Take the would-be epiphany at the end of “Last You Heard of Me”: “And in the moment I see everything\\/Start to finish sad defeat\\/Shivering lying naked next to you\\/And that’s the last you heard of me.” Even opener “Fake I.D.,” which comes off as the silliest song on the record with its “What do you think about Kanye West?” line ends on the sobering final note, “Because my friend Brandon died\\/And I feel sad\\/I miss him he was rad.” The reference to the late drummer of Wyoming’s Teenage Bottlerocket is also a plea to look past the surface and see the pain coursing beneath everyday existence. “Fake I.D.” itself shows off the lessons learned from their time with Schnapf—it’s abrasive, swaggering pop that sounds modern rock radio-ready but not far from Joyce Manor’s first three records.But all sort of bands can work with that Big Studio Money and emerge with an excessive mess. Joyce Manor know themselves, they know their audience, and they know better than to overdo the production. If anything, they’ve slowed down and pulled back. For the first time, a Joyce Manor album includes an acoustic track and a song over four minutes. The former is a quick duet about addiction between Johnson and Phoebe Bridgers called “Do You Really Want to Not Get Better?” On the opposite end of the spectrum, “Stairs” thumps along patiently as Johnson gripes, “Yeah, I’m 26 and I still live with my parents\\/Oh I can’t do laundry\\/Christ I can’t do dishes.” Johnson wrote those words when he was 19 but came to re-appreciate them while on an acoustic tour with Hop Along’s Francis Quinlan (whose mug appears on the cover of Never Hungover Again). Lyrically, the revamped track verges into creepy territory, as its narrator becomes overcome with protective paranoia for his love: “You are like a magnet for all evil ’cause there is so much good inside you.”Cody finds a more grown-up Joyce Manor, but every track contains enough blunt expressions of existential despair to tie them to their angsty past. “I feel so old today,” Johnson declares on “Eighteen,” and then immediately after on “Angel in the Snow” he muses, “How come nothing amazes me?” These might sound annoying, but buoyed by the immediacy of their music, they simply feel honest. When you watch videos of Joyce Manor concerts, it’s easy to see that the audiences connects with the band, as if they’ve never had the words to express what they are feeling. Those same people will not be disappointed with Cody; there’s a lot of cathartic emotion to revel in. Joyce Manor have proven that they are ready and willing to grow, but they’re still open to saying, “this song is a mess but so am I.”\"],[22489,\"Alt-R&B artists love to evoke turn-of-the-century R&B, albeit a version of it in which everyone was Aaliyah. While Banks, the alt-R&B project of LA singer-songwriter Jillian Banks, seems conceptualized and curated to within an inch of its life, the reality is a couple years of Banks searching for that fit. The list of collaborators on 2013’s London comes off as an attempt to reverse-engineer getting onto BBC's Sound Of list; Goddess did the same for getting onto playlists with the Weeknd. And after some success – including “Beggin for Thread” becoming a minor alternative hit – Altar attempts to do the same. In fact, The Altar has a lot in common with Goddess, including its fatal flaw: its attempts to position Banks as edgy or dangerous, despite all musical evidence to the contrary.Single “Fuck With Myself” is indicative. The conceit, your basic tale of fuck-the-haters-I’ve-got-self-love-but-ooh-what-kind? (in an interview with Zane Lowe, Banks boasted that it had “so many meanings,” which is weird because the slang has one or two) is so anodyne in 2016 that True Grit kid Hailee Steinfeld's done it with mild bowdlerization. Producer Al Shux (“Drowning,” “Empire State of Mind,” “Wicked Love”) constructs a skeleton of an R&Bass song, the sort of half-there production that’s minimalist in a way that suggests they avoided fleshing out the details. Where Banks might have brought menace to the void, she substitutes vocal gimmicks: stage whispers, clipped runs or, bizarrely, a gulped cadence that suggests she’s either choking through a straw or greeting an approaching cat.You don’t pull out this many vocal tricks unless you’re compensating for something, and in this case it’s probably Banks’ voice. At best, it evokes Martina Topley-Bird; more often, it evokes Martina Topley-Bird with a bad cold, or that bit in Chicago where Roxie likens Amos’ voice to fixing a carburetor. This wouldn't happen so often if Banks wrote to her voice, but like too many alt-R&B artists she tries to fit her voice to other artists’ cadences and winds up showcasing every weakness. The heavy Drake-reminiscent drone drags down “Haunt”; the title to would-be slow jam “Lovesick” scans a bit too literal, and the quavers-intact Vocodering of “Poltergeist” turns the track into 808s and Pneumonia. The production, while consistently solid, isn’t noteworthy enough to compensate, and while Banks’ lyrics are noteworthy, it’s not in the good way.“Judas” spends more effort name-dropping Banks’ past singles than it does on the metaphor; the last pop song, and inescapable comparison, on this subject was a brash, theologically junk mess, but at least it sounded like its artist actually fucked with Judas, or at least considered the thought. “Gemini Feed” relies on tabloid astrology and a bloodless couple’s gripe of a pre-chorus: “you’re passive-aggressive.” Perhaps it’s the remarkably coincidental timing, but “I smell a clown looking goofy dressed up like a native” would kill any track’s momentum.The other thing you'll hear Banks’ music described as is “dark pop.” In 2016 this could also mean just about anything, but mostly marketing; Tove Lo, Dua Lipa, and dozens of aspiring pop stars are launching careers on it. At this point it’s possibly an even more flooded market than R&B, yet it’s where Banks sounds the most natural. “Trainwreck” evokes, to great effect, the particular darkness that was all over pop radio in the early ’10s – blown-out vocals, big menacing synth pads, barely concealed panic. The production goes loud, and so does Banks. (It’s no coincidence that here Banks finally starts to sing.) Hitched to the chorus is a sprinting, stopping verse, Banks racing the beat and pausing to emote. On another album this might evoke rap, but it evokes just as much singer-songwriters like Maria Mena, or unlikely Drake collaborator Chantal Kreviazuk, or, more than anything, “Fast As You Can” by Fiona Apple—one of Banks' stated idols.The track’s a standout, in that it sounds like it’s off an entirely different record. If this were actually the late ’90s, with the industry trends of the time, The Altar would either be R&B via Hot AC—think Jennifer Paige—or an acoustic singer-songwriter project, and there are hints throughout the album that Banks may have had that in mind. “To the Hilt,” save a few Mýa cadences, is a straightforward piano-and-strings ballad. The title telegraphs this a bit much, but “Mother Earth” gets quite close to folk-Americana, wisps of harmonies and all, and Banks' voice serves this material nicely. One wonders what an entire album of this sort of thing would be like. It might be fusty. It would not be particularly on trend. It would not get one tours with the Weeknd. But it might finally let Banks be herself, more than anybody else. \"],[22438,\"Leon Smart might not quite have the profile of Hyperdub’s bigger names, the likes of Laurel Halo and Burial, but it’s hard to think of a figure more emblematic of the UK label’s mission to short-circuit the familiar rhythms and grooves of dance music. As DVA, Smart came up through London’s grime scene, producing for figures like Wiley and becoming a familiar face at Rinse FM, where he was an energetic presence at the helm of the former pirate station’s Grimey Breakfast Show. For all this, Smart’s own productions have increasingly shunned category, exploring a liminal space between grime, house and UK funky—a space that, for want of a better term, we might as well call Hyperdub music.This is Smart’s first full-length album going under new handle DVA [Hi:Emotions], and it marks a break of sorts from what has come before. For one, there is a broad concept here—one encompassing, among other things, techno-futurism, corporate branding, and the interface between humans and machines. With this shift into conceptual territory comes a shift towards abstraction. These are not straightforward club tracks; Smart says he composed them in the dark, illuminated by the glow of his computer monitor—a process designed to emulate his early experiences as a music listener, headphones on beneath a duvet after lights-out. NOTU_URONLINEU is seldom functional, in that way that great dance music can often be, but it uses its conceptual grounding as a springboard to explore all manner of strange hybrids and surprising possibilities.The album’s sound is initially rather alien—relatively sparse, often light in bass frequencies, and characterized by twitchy rhythms, synth washes and all manner of blips and whooshes that ping around in the high registers. It can be body-moving stuff—most obviously on enjoyable “DAFUQ,” a cartoonish melding of TNGHT-style horn blasts, dubstep lollops and angelic arpeggios. Elsewhere, tracks combine unusual textural and rhythmic motifs. “SUZHOU” and “B IT” contain fragments of familiar genres—the frantic repetitions of footwork, the glossy sheen of vaporwave—but wriggle free of any familiar niche. Sometimes a voice will float through the mix, dispensing corporate soundbites and endorsing a fictional product line called “Hi:Emotions” with uncanny-valley chirpiness. “Have you ever been lost in translation or misunderstood in emails?” asks one. “Have you had a friendship end over the tone of your texts?”In the hands of some, this sort of conceptual conceit might be the seeds of a grim sci-fi dystopia; the robots taking over. But NOTU_URONLINEU explores its themes with delicate nuance, smearing the edges of the human and artificial, the organic and the electronic, as if trying to sketch out the dimensions of a digital self. “ALMOSTU,” featuring guest vocalists Rae Rae and Roses Gabor, is quiet storm R&B going out to a lover who may be merely virtual; while a particularly slippery eight-minute track titled “NOTU_URONLINEU” lines up slashing rhythms, blasts of modular synth slurry and an unexpected but delightful segment of Rhodes piano played by collaborator Danalogue that gives the track a twinkly jazz-funk flavor, like Herbie Hancock popping up in the middle of an Autechre workout. Throughout the track, a relationship drama plays out. “What’s wrong? I know something’s wrong,” it begins. It ends: “I don’t love you anymore.” It goes on to say, “I knew that wasn’t gonna sound good.”NOTU_URONLINEU feels of a piece with recent concept-powered projects like Kode9’s Nothing or Logos, Mumdance and Shapednoise’s modular project the Sprawl—a sort of speculative fiction in sound, mapping out a space of future possibilities. It feels somewhat embryonic in places, as if some of its ideas remain fragmentary or incomplete. But, importantly for an album grappling with ideas of identity, we never lose sight of Smart amidst his concept. Wait a few seconds after the album’s closing track (excluding the brief bonus song) and we’re beamed right into his studio, can hear him sniffling and exhaling as beats ping from the speakers and one of the album’s sales drones delivers a pitch: “Have you ever made up a song in your head but didn’t have the skills to execute it?” It’s tempting to imagine Smart posed this very question to himself, before rolling up his sleeves and resolving to do something about it. The result is a vision of a prospective future both strange and alluring, a journey through virtual spaces and experimental technologies that, at heart, feels human after all.\"],[22323,\"Hiss Golden Messenger is a strange name for the music of M.C. Taylor. Rather than preach the word, he’s often scoured for it, doubted and discarded it. Faith, he learned, cannot save you from depression or from the temptation to self-destruct, and when hypocrites can play it as their “get out of jail” card, what’s the use of it at all? God barely comes into the equation on the sixth Hiss album, recorded in Taylor’s 40th year—around the time when the Big Questions tend to get outweighed by smaller, more immediate responsibilities. But his lifelong theme remains intact: What happens when you feel a distance from the thing that’s meant to sustain you?Hiss took flight with 2010’s Bad Debt, a record written in the quiet moments while Taylor’s newborn son slept. After years flailing in ’90s hardcore band Ex-Ignota and Americana outfit the Court and Spark, Taylor gave up trying, for the first time, to find an audience. The album’s charred hush found one anyway. Family and adulthood became central to the work, the revelations they offered making the hard times worthwhile. “The misery of love is a funny thing,” he sang on “Mahogany Dread” from 2014’s Lateness of Dancers. “The more it hurts, the more you think you can stand a little pain.”The album’s success tested his thesis. As his Merge debut and breakout moment, it necessitated endless touring, taking him away from his wife and two young kids, who inspired the music and gave it purpose as a vocation. Heart Like a Levee is Taylor reckoning with the guilt of being an absent provider whose work financially supports his family—and spiritually sustains him as a good father. It’s not “rock star writes home,” but a familiar theme to anyone who’s felt pulled to honor disparate callings, and the rare record that doesn’t treat adulthood as a punchline or a final resting place.Nor do the mature themes smother the songwriting, where Taylor locates a grounded soulfulness in his tapestry of folk, country, blues, and dub, whether he’s furrowing deeper into the groove he started digging on Lateness of Dancers—as on freewheeling standout “Ace of Cups Hung Low Band”—or easing back into his porch. Although Heart Like a Levee is often heavier than its sunny predecessor, the core Hiss band (Megafaun’s multi-instrumentalists Phil and Brad Cook, and drummer Matt McCaughan) tend to strike a major chord M.O., even when the lyrics are decidedly minor-chord: There are moments of profound communal joy here that continue the homespun gospel Taylor minted on Lateness. That contrast makes the music feel real and integral to a life, and the way that domesticity’s small lows and highs are always intermingled.As rollicking as it often is, Heart Like a Levee is a deeply intimate record, filled with anxious conversations about obligation. “It’s hard, Lord\\/Lord, it’s hard,” he sings on capering opener “Biloxi,” surveying the scene at his eldest kid’s birthday party. “There’s one way in and one way out and we’re gonna have a good time.” The title track unfolds with Taylor and his wife laying in bed on an ostensibly perfect morning. “We’ll pretend all we wanna,” he sings with his trademark reedy nuance. “Yeah, tomorrow I’ll be on my way.” His high-pitched acoustic guitar mounts the tension as he unleashes a series of rhetorical questions, each more desperate than the last. “Will you grieve me, honey?” he asks in a wrenched tone, then skews quieter: “Did I give you a reason to try?” he asks in one of the album’s more flooring moments.The pleas recur on “Happy Day (Sister My Sister),” a beautiful acoustic duet with Tift Merritt that sounds like a flood of relief but offers little of it. “Sister, my sister\\/What should I do?” Taylor sings with a sigh. “Should I wade in the river\\/With so many people living just\\/Just above the waterline?” If that sounds a little like liberal guilt, “Like a Mirror Loves a Hammer” is its flipside, exposing Taylor’s darkest inclinations to throw it all away rather than cause anyone more pain. “Should I drown in that Atlanta rain? Yes, babe—I can’t stand it,” he seethes, blurring into swampy dub funk shot through with mystic ricochets of reverb. The track stands alone in the record, its magnetic groove as myopic as Taylor’s mindset, doggedly pushing forward (and making the idea of a Have Fun With God-style album remix sound eminently necessary).If all this makes touring life sound like too much trouble, Heart Like a Levee offers two songs that trace Taylor’s bond to the road. “I can feel October coming on the backscratch wind,” he yearns like a weathered traveler on “Cracked Windshield,” where the tiniest golden synth gradually casts a piercing light on his gentle ruminations. The tension finally breaks on the impressionistic “As the Crow Flies,” a subtle, cantering groove that breaks into a raucous height-of-summer refrain led by Phil Cook’s euphoric holler. “Blue horizon—late again\\/West Lafayette, babe\\/And tomorrow’s a dream,” Taylor sings, and the view seems endless.Although younger male artists are returning to domestic settings in their music, there are few older male artists questioning how their work impacts upon the families they leave behind. It’s borderline inconceivable that a white, male, 40-something artist could bring a refreshing perspective to a traditional genre, but Taylor’s graceful accountability and invigorating songcraft makes him an anomaly. His own dose of perspective arrives at the end of the plainly gorgeous Heart Like a Levee.“When I set the river on fire, you laughed in my face,” he recalls on “Highland Grace,” over an easy tumble of a groove, the words and music aligned for once. He ticks off his old stubbornnesses: “And if you can’t buy it and you stand and deny it\\/And if you can’t see it and you refuse to believe it\\/And if you can’t count it but you can’t help but doubt it,” he yearns over softly twiddling piano. “But loving her was easy\\/The easiest thing in the world.” Love as salvation is Old Testament songwriting, but few artists make you feel it like Taylor does.\"],[22307,\"At this point of her career, it’s easy to forget that Norah Jones was once considered a jazz singer. Back in 2002, long before she worked with Jack White and Brian “Danger Mouse” Burton, Jones released Come Away With Me, an understated gem that went on to sell over 11 million units and earn eight Grammy awards—including Album of the Year and Song of the Year for “Don’t Know Why.” Armed with that voice—a wry, simmering inflection—the Texas native has proven she can sing anything, and sound natural doing so, no matter where the road has taken her.That said, it’s been tough to assess Jones’ creative arc. Feels Like Home, her 2004 sophomore LP, eschewed the traditional jazz of the first record for a folk\\/country sound. She’s released two honky-tonk country albums as a member of the Little Willies; and in 2012, Jones dropped Little Broken Hearts, a concept record about emotional anguish, set against Danger Mouse’s soulful pop arrangements. Elsewhere, Jones had notable features on Mouse and composer Daniele Luppi’s Rome; with Q-Tip, OutKast and Talib Kweli on their respective albums; and on the Robert Glasper Experiment’s Black Radio 2. Throughout all this, Jones has remained somewhat anonymous, mainly because she’s never appealed to pop and hip-hop consumers. Her music speaks to the adult contemporary crowd, those who actually buy CDs instead of streaming online. Jones has maintained a nice career largely out of the public eye; now 14 years removed from her seminal work, the musician returns to initial form on Day Breaks, her sixth studio album.In a recent interview with the New York Times, Jones said the genesis of the LP can be traced back to a 2014 performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., during a 75th anniversary concert for her label, Blue Note Records. She was performing a cover of songwriter Jesse Harris’ “I’ve Got to See You Again” with iconic saxophonist Wayne Shorter, drummer Brian Blade, and bassist John Patitucci. “When I started thinking about making a ‘jazz record,’ mostly I was thinking about recording with Wayne and Brian,” Jones told the Times. “I didn’t want it to be standards. I was hoping for something very rhythmic, with Wayne floating over the top.” Shorter, Blade, and organist Dr. Lonnie Smith appear throughout Day Breaks, an efficient 12-track set featuring nine original songs and three covers: Horace Silver’s “Peace,” Duke Ellington’s “Fleurette Africaine” and Neil Young’s “Don’t Be Denied.” Day Breaks is especially sparse, a no-frills record that fades into the background without much fuss. It seems to reflect the singer’s personal and professional comfort, that—after 15 years as a signed artist with more than 50 million records sold—Jones doesn’t need to adhere to industry pressures to remain relevant. Whereas some artists revert to their best-received work as a way to reignite past glory, Day Breaks feels like the logical next step for a singer who’s done just about everything there is to do musically. This one isn't a barn-burner, but it's not supposed to be.Unfortunately, though, Day Breaks grows a bit tedious near the middle, and it's easy to forget it's playing if you aren't paying attention. Lyrically, Day Breaks embraces a hazy—if not melancholy—vibe, similar to the Billie Holiday albums Jones listened to as a child. These tracks address some level of perseverance, a pushing through to better days whether romantically or socially. Jones uses a conversational cadence to tell these stories, bolstering the narrative and giving her words better impact. On “Flipside,” a song about racial and civic injustice, Jones and the band sound especially poignant. The other songs slow to a crawl, but this one is hard-charging with a strong message. “If we’re all free, then why does it seem we can’t just be?” Jones asks. “Put the guns away or we’re all gonna lose.” (As of this review, two more unarmed black men—Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina—were shot and killed by police for no reason.) And while Jones didn’t write the lyrics to “Peace”—it is a cover, after all—she effectively owns the message. “Peace,” she hums, “is for everyone.” Sure that’s a noble idea, but we’ve got a long way to go.\"],[22486,\"G Perico hails from deep in South Central Los Angeles—east of the Forum, west of the Watts Towers. On his breakthrough mixtape, Shit Don’t Stop, the blue-draped, Jheri-curled rapper bounces between L.A. landmarks real and imagined, haunting the bar at the Ritz-Carlton on Olympic, surveying his subjects from a stoplight on Western. More importantly, Perico channels some of California’s most colorful legends (Suga Free, Too $hort, DJ Quik, even Eazy-E), and rolls those influences into one sneering, swaggering whole. To that end, Shit Don’t Stop follows YG’s Still Brazy in providing a natural endpoint for decades of disparate rap threads that unspooled up and down the 5 freeway. Perico’s most obvious analogue from recent years is 100s, the Berkeley rapper whose Ice Cold Perm mixtape and (especially) IVRY EP pushed pimp rap back into vogue. But 100s (whose music has mutated and who now goes by his given name, Kossisko) treated the profession as something abstract, a fever dream fueled by pager beeps and curl activator. By contrast, Shit Don’t Stop pulls the pimp into real life—not exactly an everyman, but a member of a larger, sometimes grim world. On “Million Dolla Mission,” he’s not above the law, but he makes it work for him anyway: “They booked me at the station, but I ain’t never stay\\/I’m a real boss, all my bail money’s paid.” In that vein, the record’s closing song, “Streets Don’t Love Us,” is a lament for murdered friends and indicted peers, lurking Feds and nascent third strikes. It grounds Perico’s work by detailing all the forces conspiring against him; it also colors the more joyous songs by warning that the “blue Pumas, all suede” might disappear at midnight. All of this is bolstered by a story that’s already entered L.A. rap lore: earlier this year, Perico was shot in front of a recording studio in South Central. Instead of acquiescing to a lengthy hospital stay, he opted for a crude cleaning of the wound in his hip, and made it to his scheduled performance that night, blood still dripping down his leg. And yet Shit Don’t Stop is a potent reminder that, despite the way gangsta rap is caricatured in the press and by detractors, the genre can be relentlessly fun. On “Nothin’ but Love,” Perico raps about jumping bail as if he was going to the gym; on “Dream Nigga,” he threatens to steal your girl and make her bring food stamps to pay for dinner. The second verse of “I Got Business” details a 4 a.m. encounter, where Perico reluctantly has sex with a woman (“I ain’t even ‘bout to hit it long\\/I just wanna give you yours and then get mine”) and then chastises her for not being courteous enough to call beforehand. Though he’s a capable, occasionally exceptional songwriter, G Perico’s strongest asset is his voice. It clearly owes a debt to Quik and Suga Free, but it’s employed in a series of modern cadences (see: the first verse in “Dream Nigga,” where he slips into the same flow Nef the Pharaoh has been resurrecting upstate). He doesn’t break the structure of bars the way Suga Free did, but he’s nimble enough that he can hit technical passages while keeping his overwhelming cool. Given that sort of smart, selective reverence, G Perico casts himself as a torchbearer who isn’t all that concerned about torchbearing. These are songs for long, sweltering cookouts, perilous house parties, and the maddening freeway trips in between. (As aggressively regional as Shit Don’t Stop is, it does take a stab at Master P’s “I’m Bout It, Bout It,” which, while most famously repurposed by Dipset in the early 2000s, has also been a testing ground of sorts for young rappers like Florida’s Robb Bank$). In a crowded—and excellent—year for West coast hip-hop, G Perico stands out as one of the most promising newcomers. \"],[22478,\"Even if it never became prominent and frequent enough to occupy the same trend-space as dancehall or Bollywood did, the intersection of hip-hop and Brazilian music has provided some indelible moments over the years. Dilla stirring up Stan Getz and Luis Bonfa’s early ’60s bossa nova for the Pharcyde’s “Runnin’,” Mos Def building “Casa Bey” around a cut from Brazilian funk powerhouse Banda Black Rio, Wanderlea’s tropical quiet storm “Lindo” finding its way into a grip of ’10s beats peaking with Isaiah Rashad’s “Smile”—even Black Eyed Peas in their prototypical Cali backpacker days knew the strength of a good Jorge Ben loop. So the surface notion of BROOKZILL! (all-caps\\/exclamation point theirs) as a melding of Brazilian musical influence with American hip-hop isn’t the most unprecedented idea, even if it benefits from the more direct engagement with a Brazilian artist.  Rodrigo Brandão, who raps under the name Gorila Urbano, was introduced to the creatively restless producer Prince Paul in São Paulo about a decade back. And over time their collaborative interests drew in longtime Paul cohort\\/producer\\/3 Feet High and Rising host Don Newkirk and Digable Planets’ Ladybug Mecca, the Portuguese-speaking daughter of two Brazilian expat jazz musicians. Given three Brooklyn-based artists with an unbreakable connection to ’90s rap bohemia and another, Brandão, whose previous trans-American collabs last year included indie favorites Del the Funky Homosapien (3rd World Vision) and Anti-Pop Consortium’s Beans (Takara & Brandão), you’d be right to expect Throwback to the Future to feel like an artifact of a time—and a style—that seems more defiantly earnest, if only in retrospect.That owes a lot to the flows both MCs use, which are breezier and simpler than modern fans might be used to and older heads might admit an ambivalence towards. That in itself isn’t a problem, but it does make the record feel a bit more fleeting than it means to be. Ladybug was the velvet scalpel of Digable Planets, cool and precise and right to the point even in abstraction, and she keeps up that smooth demeanor here—sometimes to the point where her laid-back energy level gets drowned out by the production’s bottom-heavy analog funk touches. That can be a strain for an MC who’s more listenable than quotable here; as someone who can catch the mood of childhood nostalgia (the Del-featuring “Maralém”) or remembrances of those lost (“Saudade Songbook”) with a straightforward energy less reliant on lyrical flash, the musical qualities of her voice don’t always get their due. That goes double for Brandão, who raps with a sleepy purr and would rather murmur than shout, even on uptempo cuts like the banger closer “Let’s Go (É Noiz)!”.Which is a shame, since the production transcends sun-drenched post-Tropicalia funk—it’s a deeper invocation of the titular throwback, the saudade of something absent that will never come back no matter how much it’s pulled apart and rebuilt. Paul and Newkirk’s music walks the line between old samples and new constructions: beats from albums that coincided with the mid-’60s to mid ’80s reign of Brazil’s military dictatorship, reconfigured to try and envision a brighter future that wound up collapsing under this summer’s fiasco of the Olympics and the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. It’s a party vibe that doesn’t entirely know the party’s about to end in the worst way. But while it lasts—through the Afrobeat fusion of “Mad Dog in Yoruba” and the upfront yet faraway-sounding horn blasts in “Macumba 3000” and the baile\\/bossa simmer of “Todos Os Terreiros”—it’s enough to make you wish the background music was up front.\"],[22474,\"Green Day are victims of accidental evolution. Between Dookie and American Idiot, they shifted just enough in texture and composition that the modest, Bay Area-pop-punk trio eventually generated the aura of an imperial rock band. They managed this without ever directly shedding their pop or punk sensibilities, even as their ambitions slipped into the hysterical space of musical theater. Revolution Radio, their first album in four years, following up the miscalculated trilogy ¡UNO!, ¡DOS!, ¡TRÉ!, seems a deliberate reduction in scale. ¡UNO!, ¡DOS!, ¡TRÉ! documented a band without any ideas; it’s an oddly empty, back-to-basics rock album unreasonably contorted over three records. Revolution Radio documents a band with one idea, which is, as far as one can tell, to make a Green Day record, one with fewer indulgences and overarching concepts and more capital-R Rock. The opener, “Somewhere Now,” has brief flashes of invention; it’s their first opener on any album to evolve from gentle acoustic filigrees into stomping dinosaur rock. It’s designed to resemble the Who’s unhinged compression of styles, but it’s oddly weighted, so that the classic rock schematic is undermined in its execution. “I shop online so I can vote\\/At the speed of life,” Billie Joe Armstrong sings. His voice has lost some of its body and occupies an insecure, nasal frequency throughout the record, and it’s in this hollow timbre that he delivers most of the album’s lyrical misfires, which are mostly unrelated ideas juxtaposed to sound important or dangerous. “We all die in threes,” he sings, less like a natural end to the song’s chorus and more of a dead end that the melody struggles to recover from. The clichés fail to resolve into a song, and what’s left is a plastic tray littered with “important” rock gestures.In “Bang Bang,” the first single, Armstrong tries to assume the perspective of a mass shooter who is eager to see their image preserved and multiplied on social media. For the most part, this approach produces incoherent combinations of social media jargon and historical violence. “I got my photobomb,” Armstrong sings. “I got my Vietnam.” The character study, a hypercompressed and retrofitted Natural Born Killers, is neither interesting nor illuminating. The title track is inspired by a Black Lives Matter protest in New York that Armstrong abandoned his car to join. None of the details or the specificities of the protest or its parent movement enter the song; the lyrics instead are generic kodachromes of activism (“Give me cherry bombs and gasoline,” and, “Legalize the truth!”)There are some signs of animation and ambition: “Outlaws” embeds nostalgia in more nostalgia, shifting between major and minor chords as Armstrong recalls his youth as a “criminal in bloom.” It also moves through its chord changes so inevitably it almost sounds generated by a Green Day ballad algorithm. “Still Breathing” is the most successful melody on the record; the shift from verse to chorus is thrilling, though restricted to the traditional designs of pop-punk, and, as a kind of vague description of survival, it’s Armstrong’s most convincing lyrics on the record. But Revolution Radio otherwise rarely escapes the Green Day archetype, an established language that, here, feels inelastic and calcified. It misses the living superstructures on American Idiot, the craft-based, Kinks-esque storytelling approach of Warning:, or even the accelerating entropy of ¡UNO!, ¡DOS!, and ¡TRÉ!, which at least tried to shape a collective shrug into something unusual. Revolution Radio feels like the product of three people committed to making the idea of a Green Day record in 2016, but with reduced abilities and without direction. The album cover depicts a portable stereo on fire, which feels like an unintended analogy for the form the band takes on record: burned out, crumbled, warped into an inanimate husk of itself.\"],[22450,\"Whether they’re parlaying their carefully cultivated mystique into pop stardom, or just outed by the press, camera-shy buzz acts generally don’t stay anonymous for long. But the masked members of GOAT have now made it to their third album without breaking character or being doxxed, which is no small achievement for a self-mythologizing entity in the age of oversharing. And even if they’re the only ones still recounting their incredulous origin story with a straight face (or a mask depicting a straight face), GOAT are still clinging the conceit, and to this day, interviews with the band put journalists in the awkward position of picking up the phone and asking to speak with somebody named Fuzzmaster.And yet in GOAT’s case, the ridiculous high-concept package ultimately reinforces the sincerity with which they approach their pan-cultural psych-funk fusion. Unlike fellow Swedes Ghost—whose campy black-mass theatrics seem like an awful lot of effort for what’s essentially melodic ’80s pop-metal—there’s very little ironic distance between GOAT’s image and execution. For them, costumery is not a means of drawing attention to themselves but deflecting it back onto their collectivist music. If GOAT aren’t actually a small-town sect reinterpreting the ritualistic sounds of the ancients (and are really just crate-diggers with robust internet connections and unlimited budgets for Afrobeat imports), what’s important is that they genuinely resemble one. On Requiem, that narrative becomes further entrenched, as GOAT lure us deeper into the woods for a communion ceremony under moonlight. This is their Zeppelin III move, a psychedelia rendered primarily with acoustic elements, pastoral brushes, and field-recording ambience. But even in stripped-down mode, GOAT are unrepentant maximalists, and the full weight of the ensemble is always felt. They’ve dialed down the volume, but not the frantic exuberance. On the joyous Afropop of “Trouble In the Streets” and the mandolin-powered raga “Try My Robe,” the band’s female mouthpiece blares as loudly as she did on past acid-rock ragers, while the chirpy flute-folk of “Union of Sun and Moon” and “I Sing in Silence” do little to temper the band’s innate sense of groove.But while there’s a greater emphasis here on compact songcraft (“Alarms” could be a brown-acid Mamas and the Papas), GOAT are still at their most transfixing when they engage in rhythmic hypnotherapy. Requiem is a double album, granting the band the real estate to stretch out more than usual and, at times, you wish they’d go even further: the thundering “Temple Rhythms” teases the connection between campfire drum circles and piano-house raves, though it fades out before the band can properly build upon its vibrating foundation. However, with the self-referential “Goatband” and “Goatfuzz,” Requiem erects its towering tentpole tracks: The former is a mesmerizing jangle jam where GOAT’s wah-wahed shredding dissolves into a textural haze; the latter is a rare moment of amped-up aggression whose electric-boogie breaks imagine Grand Funk Railroad riffing on \\\\\"Yoo Doo Right.\\\\\"Despite their mosaic of international influences, GOAT are, at heart, a classic-rock band in pagan clothing. Even at their busiest, the group rarely veer toward confrontational chaos, and despite their sinister appearance, their lyrics are incense-scented, hippy-dippy platitudes (at times excessively so—this band has no compunction about giving its ballads names like “Psychedelic Lover”). But if you’re wondering how long GOAT can keep up the cult-rock gambit, well, there’s evidence here to suggest GOAT are pondering that very question, too.  Requiem’s penultimate track is an instrumental titled “Goodbye,” which could very well just signal the album’s end, however, the sense of finality is compounded by the fact the song sounds like the Doors’ “The End” given an Indo-funk remix. It’s followed by the closing curio “Ubuntu,” which reveals that GOAT haven’t just copped their sense of rhythm from African funk records, but their way of life as well. Atop free-form organ doodles, we hear recordings of men and women from the continent explaining the titular philosophy of connectedness and sharing, their sanguine sentiments (“I’m not human without your being present”) folded into GOAT’s own communal ethos through a distant flashback of “Diarabi,” the first song on the band’s first album, World Music. It’s the sort of full-circle move that suggests the closing of a chapter—but even if GOAT’s faces remain a mystery, with Requiem, they’ve at least showed us a bit more of their heart.   \"],[22449,\"Perhaps the most surprising thing about Root\\/Void—an album unfathomably deep in the discography of Vermont-based psych duo Matt “MV” Valentine and Erika “EE” Elder—is that they hadn’t already released a song titled “Yr My Jam.” The title is a tidy encapsulation of MV & EE’s most defining features: the intimate bond that makes their music together feel wholly natural, and the lengthy, meandering improvisations that constitute their records. The song in question is, fittingly, a nine-minute encapsulation of their best tendencies, wrapping their brain-dead, out-of-key vocals around Valentine’s searing guitar solos. “Your love is so wide it could have been a canyon,” they shout in unison, “Flies so high, I’m surprised they didn’t ban ya.”Released on the Woodsist label, as opposed to Valentine’s in-house Child of Microtones imprint, and arriving on the heels of two excellent solo albums from Valentine, Root\\/Void might seem like the perfect opportunity for the duo to clean up their sound and aim at a larger audience. But the very joy of MV+EE’s spacey, homemade music has always been that they seem largely incapable of breaking through. Together, they have invented their own language and have demonstrated no interest in varying or expanding it for newcomers. Still, Root\\/Void does have its fair share of high points, many of which would serve as fitting introductions. Inasmuch as MV+EE could ever pen a pop song, “Much Obliged” is the album’s hit. In three minutes, it features an actually-catchy chorus and a sunny melody that wouldn’t sound out of place on a latter day Dinosaur Jr. record. If “Much Obliged” represents the album’s most amiable tendencies, then “I’m Still In Love With You Love > Void” is its finest experiment. A slow, synthy jam, it’s akin to the sound of “On the Beach” blasting from a rattling van, driving slowly down a beach road at sunset. Its 11 minutes glide by effortlessly and close the album with a deep sense of atmosphere that lingers like thick humidity. Of course, not every moment on the album is quite a revelation. The staggeringly titled “No $ (Shit Space - It’s All About the Coin ¢ \\/ Corn),” for example, also happens to resembles a Neil Young song; unfortunately that song is “Cough Up the Bucks.” The two jams that center on the repeated mantra “Love is everyone,” meanwhile, could have likely been condensed to greater their impact (and to lessen the potential for listeners to ponder what that phrase means). The balance between psychedelic nonsense and genuine beauty has always been an underlying tension in the group’s music, and at this point in their career, the idea of turning off potential listeners isn’t likely to weigh too heavily on their blissed-out minds. More than maybe any MV & EE release, Root\\/Void is propelled by a sense of cosmic satisfaction that makes even its weaker moments feel like a necessary part of its story. In its relative concision, it also feels like the duo’s most mature album, a thoughtful, hazy meditation on love. Nearly two decades into their career, MV & EE have firmly drawn the borders of their music, but it’s never been more exciting to hear them explore the strange, beautiful terrain in between.CORRECTION: The original version of this story incorrectly identified Valentine’s in-house label as Ecstatic Peace when it is Child of Microtones.\"],[22460,\"Other states may bear more significance for metal, but Arizona is not without its history. Soulfly’s Max Cavalera, best known for his time in Brazilian thrash pioneers Sepultura, calls Phoenix his home. Jason Newsted got his start in the neighboring Flotsam and Jetsam before Metallica called upon him to replace Cliff Burton. And the Metal God himself, Judas Priest’s Rob Halford, was even the publisher of a Phoenix entertainment paper, Where It’s Hot Weekly. As far as current bands go, there aren’t many, which makes Arizona death metal group Gatecreeper all the more special. After an affirming debut demo tape in 2014 and a series of splits, they’ve finally extended their reach on their first full-length, Sonoran Depravation.Gatecreeper stand out not by aping one particular style of death metal, but by acting as a polyglot of various classic bands. Their demo was prime Swedish worship, and considering the slew of hardcore bands that were drawing from Entombed’s buzzsaw sound—Nails and Trap Them chief among them—an American version of the pure thing was long overdue. Depravation still carries that influence; most records that Kurt Ballou has a hand in do. (Ballou, metal producer and guitarist of Converge, mixed Depravation.)They also show a devotion to Florida legends Obituary’s ethos of keeping things as uncomplicated as possible. In the late ’80s, Obituary stripped the gothic trappings of Celtic Frost’s mid-paced stomp and brought it to its barest essence, and in Depravation’s groovier sections, that tradition lives on. Sometimes, Obituary is directly referenced, like in the main riff of “Lost Forever,” or the turn to death-doom in “Patriarchal Grip.” In the latter, Gatecreeper slow the tempos to put as much weight on the riffs as possible. It sounds like they could give out at any moment in the Arizona heat; when the pressure’s on, that’s when they’re at their heaviest. “Grip” is an experiment in applying Asphyx’s thick riffing to their interpretation of Entombed’s guitar tone, and what a fusion it is.When Gatecreeper crank up the speed on “Desperation,” the Obituary ethos becomes more spiritual than direct. This is a track that cannot be bogged down by excessive soloing or a sudden drone dirge. It’s an aerodynamic boulder—bulky riffs blessed with a nimble lightness. Even in the album’s rare flourishes, like “Flamethrower,” bearing their most Swedish lead work, Gatecreeper always bring it back to the direct, crushing riff. “Slave,” from their demo, ended with a doomy riff that could have gone on forever, and the album is rife with similarly hypnotic moments. That’s another layer of “Lost”’s appeal, and “Sterilized” ends with a chunky, palm-muted, NYHC-esque breakdown that Suffocation would be proud of. Just when Gatecreeper are on the verge on riding a riff too long, their inner John Tardy kicks in. Nothing goes to waste. Depravation eschews technicality not to cover up for a lack of adventurousness or ability, but to affirm the band’s real talent: getting the most out of every riff.Depravation arrives not long after another of Gatecreeper’s key influences, Bolt Thrower, announced their breakup. These retirements will become more common over time; even touring machines like Cannibal Corpse and Deicide won’t go on forever. Younger bands, like Gatecreeper, must keep death metal alive with their own stamps. Sure, the classics will (hopefully) always be in print and on services somehow, but Depravation is necessary because it shows that there is still life even in the most rudimentary of the genre’s characteristics. Simplicity works when it’s durable, and Depravation is unwavering.\"],[22439,\"Of all the heavy bands that get credit for having “jazzy” tendencies, few have legitimately ventured into jazz as deeply as Candiria. More than two decades ago, the Brooklyn quintet forged a remarkably cohesive blend of metal and hardcore with post-bop, fusion, hip-hop, and ambient noise. The timing is key, as Candiria emerged during an especially fertile period for metal, when the genre was being throttled into a kind of creative hyperdrive by musicians eager to find new angles on heaviness. It speaks volumes that Candiria’s twists on the form stood out so much given the climate—and that the band was able to sustain its hunger for exploration over a deliriously inventive five-album run from 1995–2002 .On While They Were Sleeping, Candiria’s first album in six years, the transitions between chunky deathcore riffs and toe-tapping swing parts with horn arrangements may feel less dazzling than they once did, but that's only because the band performed them so flawlessly in the past. The execution remains as seamless as ever. Tellingly, Candiria only ever come off as dilettantes not when they resemble Mahavishnu Orchestra or Converge, but when they veer close to the radio-friendly melodies the Deftones have come to rely on far too much lately.Like on their last two albums, 2004’s What Doesn't Kill You... and 2009’s Kiss the Lie, guitarist\\/songwriter John LaMacchia and frontman Carley Coma at times risk vocal cliches that are diametrically opposed to the death metal and hardcore grunts upon which Candiria staked a reputation. Thankfully, several distinguishing features guarantee that the songs on While They Were Sleeping will not end up on Active Rock radio anytime soon.First, the new riffs don't have the polished sheen of the last two albums, hearkening instead to the slashing tones favored by the band's one-time contemporaries in street-tough hardcore acts like Madball, Merauder, and Biohazard. Likewise, subtle trimmings in the arrangements and mix ensure a richness that belies the music’s outer accessibility. The quintessentially anthemic “Mereya,” for example has not one but two jazz-flavored bridge sections with horns—each distinct from the other in the way the horns are first mixed up-front and then smeared to the outer edges of the stereo field to create a dreamlike atmosphere.And even if While They Were Sleeping doesn’t quite blaze trails on par with the band’s classic catalog, the flute on “Wandering Light” and the radio static on “The Cause” show that Candiria aren’t merely reaching for novel sounds but genuinely searching for new expressions. Given how many times they’ve sculpted songs out of ambient noise in the past, the fact that “The Cause” breaks new ground in spite of its pedestrian ingredients—sound effect, riff, distorted screams, drum beat—shows what an achievement Candiria’s song structures truly are.Lastly, there’s Coma’s breathtaking range, his voice essentially pulling the weight of half a dozen singers. And yet, even with Coma’s fluidity, the band makes room for vocalist Andrea Horne, whose backing vocals give the music that one extra push away from convention and towards transcendence—a critical ingredient in the album’s emotional impact given the insularity of its lyrical concept.If you find Coma’s lyrics about a character named Mereya hard to fathom, you’re not alone: Even LaMacchia and longtime bassist Michael MacIvor have openly expressed their resistance to writing music to fit Coma’s storyline about a failed musician who rebels against New York City’s ruling monarchy. Inspired by current events like the Ferguson riots, Coma clearly intended for the concept to work on a metaphorical level. But Coma’s vision of New York isn’t as universally relatable as the substance underlying his central idea.Sure, the riffs on this album recall the distinctly urban vibe of ’90s-era New York hardcore. But the fact is that Candiria have too much to offer to pin themselves to the mythology of the five boroughs. That said, the concept doesn’t intrude as much as Coma’s bandmates feared. When Coma sings, “No way I’ll go back to a beggar\\/So pay it up to hear me sing\\/Melodic waterfalls\\/Get with the protocol” on “Mereya,” it’s a fairly transparent indictment of the music industry. It’s also deliciously ironic that he’s doing so on a song where he and the band flirt with the commercialism they’re decrying.Candiria has built up more than enough credibility to strike this kind of balance without stumbling. But after two albums where the band came close to losing touch with its essence, While They Were Sleeping goes a long way towards restoring its reputation as one of the most convincingly flexible acts that metal and hardcore have ever seen.\"],[22253,\"The United States in 1989 was awash in conservatism, discord, and dissent—George H.W. Bush assumed the U.S. presidency after two terms of Reagan, gun violence was on the rise, the crack epidemic was in full swing. But with the imminent shift in decades, so too opened up possibilities. Grassroots organizing for Earth Day 1990 was underway, a worldwide effort for environmental awareness that seemed to singlehandedly make recycling an imperative status quo. Members of the AIDS advocacy group ACT UP protested St. Patrick’s Cathedral and crashed the New York Stock Exchange to protest regressive views and HIV drug profiteering. KRS-One created the “Stop the Violence” movement, leading to a broad coalition of rappers to cut a song, “Self Destruction,” that would benefit the National Urban League. Hope sprung anew for a fresh era, and it was all manifesting in pools of revitalized activism across the country.In other words, it was “time to give a damn, let’s work together,” as 23-year-old Janet Jackson sang on “Rhythm Nation,” the title track of her fourth proper album, a passionate entreaty delivered with the choreography of a boxer’s pose and an iconic military kick. Rhythm Nation 1814 was the pop album that defined this moment on the brink, one that reflected Jackson’s exposure to the rise of 24-hour news, which influenced the album in the form of channel-surfing interludes and the urgency of a new political awakening. In response to what she saw as a world crumbling around her, Jackson explicitly laid out her own vision of a global anti-racist utopia, while actually creating such a space within an album that had no genre or topical boundaries. It was brawny and righteous; heard alongside her independence-asserting 1986 release Control, Rhythm Nation 1814 represented the full-spectrum actualizing of her womanhood, juxtaposing emotional, physical, and political power with the first visuals of Jackson as a dyed-in-the-wool sex symbol.Rhythm Nation 1814 became the rare album to combine multi-platinum-selling pop music and explicit social messages without crossing the line into preachiness. The ironclad songwriting of the still-going power trio of Jackson, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis had a lot to do with that—at this point, they were infusing their synth funk with looser, layered rhythms and exploring the distance between funk and metal. Her vocals were often considered breathy and lilting, but on this album, Jackson established her lion’s roar, even at her uppermost pitch. The title track incorporated the muscled riff from “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” connecting Sly Stone’s own sociopolitical message to hers. But its syncopated kicks and Jackson’s self-assured mission were resolutely contemporary, the result of a time when tape splicing and sampling were considered the zenith of pop experimentation.In that sense, Rhythm not only dovetailed with a political era in hip-hop, a genre with a heavy stylistic influence on the album—Public Enemy’s It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back and Salt-n-Pepa’s Blacks’ Magic bookended Rhythm Nation’s release, as did Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing—but it set a precedent for conceptual pop albums far beyond it. For one, the absurdly derided “militancy” of Beyoncé’s powerful Black Panther-alluding Superbowl performance, as well as Lemonade as both a visual epic and political statement, have clear and undeniable precedents in 1814’s militaristic, optimistic critique. (MTV aired Rhythm Nation 1814 FILM, the visual album Jackson termed a “telemusical,” in an hour-long special, a trendsetting antecedent to Lemonade and a postscript to her brother Michael’s Thriller epic. Young viewers rushed to wear metal-plated ballcaps and dangle their house keys from a single ear.) With it, Jackson demanded multiplicity in both image and genre, in a time when black women pop singers of her oeuvre weren’t often given it. Then, as now, she knew she would not be afforded that multidimensionality on good faith—she had to make it for herself.Rhythm Nation opens with an industrial-sounding “Interlude: Pledge,” in which she, as our righteous leader, lays out her mission for social justice in a new utopia, “a nation with no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs.” Behind her, disciples say words in a manner of poetry, a chorus; just after she finishes saying that she and her crew are “pushing toward a world rid of colorlines,” a man’s voice whispers the word “dance,” and that juxtaposition epitomized her approach.Jackson’s a multimedia artist to be sure—her music was not complete without the dance was not complete without the visuals—but her particular mix of politics with dancefloor acumen and box-step swing was miraculous. The bridge for “The Knowledge,” in which Jackson and her constituents call and respond the words “Prejudice\\/No!\\/Ignorance\\/ No!\\/Bigotry\\/No!\\/Illiteracy\\/No!,” is the stuff of a political rally, theoretically incongruous in a pop song. And yet overlaid on a creeping New Jack Swing bassline, its stridency transformed into physicality, the cadences inspiring the idea that, shit, maybe dancing really does have the power to liberate us. In the video, she smashed glass, did a half-snake, and posed with her index finger pointing at her brain on the downbeat.Shortening the distance between funk, industrial experiments—you can link Pretty Hate Machine’s synth clangor from that same year to Rhythm Nation’s easily enough—and New Jack Swing, Jackson was making a statement about the multitudes of her pop artistry, as well as her broader multitudes as a black woman. Where Control was about liberating herself from the expectations of her family and specifically her father, Rhythm Nation was in direct response to her label’s exhortations that she make a “Control II,” as Jimmy Jam described it, which clearly was too small a box to hold her artistic impulses. She was in full flourish, and also staking out further claim as a sex symbol, as lead single “Miss You Much,” slinky-sad “Come Back to Me,” and the image-altering “Love Will Never Do (Without You)” solidified. The former was the pop love song of the year and a smash hit with a chair-dancing video that’s still being imitated. (Ciara and Tinashe, at the least, would be forever altered.)“Love Will Never Do” was inextricable from Jackson’s bustier gallivanting with half-clad muscle men, actor\\/models Djimon Hounsou and Antonio Sabáto Jr, on the beach. “I was so used to being a tomboy, covered from head to toe,” she said in I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution. “I wanted to do something different for the last video from Rhythm Nation… with the top half, I never wore something so tiny in my life. And I didn’t have on a bra.” The video, shot in high-contrast and glimmering black and white, was specifically calibrated to fashion spread specifications—courtesy of director Herb Ritts, a frequent photographer of supermodels—and moreover to match Jackson, then 23, with her emergence as a femme fatale.This would thrust her career into an adult sensuality—by 1993, at 27, she would be posing topless on the cover of Rolling Stone. But Rhythm Nation’s arc was also explicitly historical. After much speculation about what the “1814” in the title stood for, Jackson later confirmed that it referred to the year Francis Scott Key wrote the “Star-Spangled Banner,” firmly asserting this was her new national anthem. In the “Alright” video, a song that worked alongside “Escapade” as an explicit reprieve from the social ills she addressed on the album—the permission to get loose after all that stress, a pop structure that still proves useful today—Jackson wore a zoot suit and cast ’40s and ’50s icons Cyd Charisse and Cab Calloway, the former a dance legend of the silver screen, the latter a music director who spent much of his early career as the gifted entertainment for wealthy whites in Harlem’s segregated Cotton Club. “Alright” was a pop art homage to those old timey musicals, and an implicit vision of what the world could be like, should her utopia be instated. The melody was forward-looking and comforting, a love song and with more swing and the synth horns that signified a kind of aspiration among an orchestra of agreeance. She sang:Friends come and friends may goMy friends you’re real I knowTrue self you have shownYou’re alright with meThat some dismissive critics then thought the politics were separable from the love songs was an incorrect reading. Jackson’s further assertion of self was as personal-as-political as the era demanded, reflecting in part her relationship and eventual marriage to René Elizondo, done in secret to keep both the press and her former dadager at bay. She was fully growing into herself as a human, exploring her internal territory and reconciling it with the world outside, while pushing herself musically more than ever. “Black Cat,” which she wrote entirely herself, was the fully manifested example of this internal and external congealing. She threw down a slinky, sexy snarl over a rock guitar shred that was also wildly jiggy, making an unlikely dive-bar banger that spoke to both gang members and the wronged women who loved them. Another nod to history—topically, the bad boy lament could be traced back to Big Mama Thornton, the black blueswoman who invented rock’n’roll—Jackson was proving to the world she was as versatile as any other chart-topper of the day, and no move she made was without substance. Perhaps by presenting her self-made utopia, she also envisioned that the real-life dystopian one would recognize her not for what it wanted her to be, but for who she was.\"],[22318,\"The circus around Oasis’ third album, Be Here Now, makes the modern hoopla surrounding Frank Ocean, Kanye West, and Beyoncé look like amateur hour. Never was the hunger for new product greater, and never was the infrastructure designed to supply it in poorer shape. Back in the summer of 1997, the Manchester band’s label, Creation, and management, Ignition, were mobilized for battle, attempting to downplay the hype after months of tabloid chaos and over-saturation. Oasis had actually made another album, which should have been news enough.Never mind that in September of ’96, Liam Gallagher had bailed on their diabolical MTV Unplugged performance before walking out on an American tour because, he claimed, he needed to buy a house. Two months later, he was arrested on London’s Oxford Street at 7.25 a.m. with his pockets full of cocaine, described by police officers as “an unkempt man, obviously the worse for wear.” The following January, Noel Gallagher left the nation clutching at pearls after declaring drug-taking to be as normal as having a cup of tea. The pair of them could barely leave their houses for the throngs of paparazzi camped outside.The new record was also encumbered by what may have been the greatest millstone in pop music history: the double success of 1994’s Definitely Maybe and 1995’s What’s the Story (Morning Glory), which had already been minted as era-defining classics. You can see why the powers that be were trying to manage expectations. Journalists issued with a cassette of Be Here Now had to sign an absurd contract stating that they wouldn’t talk about the album while in bed with their partner. Ignition brought lawsuits against nascent fansites that carried any trace of copyrighted material. They called the police on three local radio stations that broke the embargo for lead single “D’You Know What I Mean?”, and pulled a raft of exclusive tracks from the BBC Radio 1 Evening Session after it was deemed that DJ Steve Lamacq hadn’t layered enough jingles over the songs to deter home-tapers. Even label staff were forbidden to enter the office at certain hours, lest they overhear the album, and at one point, Creation got a specialist in to check whether their phones had been tapped by Murdoch rag The Sun. It’s almost as if there were stratospheric amounts of cocaine involved at every level of the operation.It might sound like damage control, but if anyone was engaged in that, it was the British music press. They had looked foolish after underrating What’s the Story (upon which Oasis played to 250,000 people across two nights at Knebworth), and were aware that Britpop’s luster was starting to tarnish. Every major news program sent a camera crew to regional record shops on the Thursday of release (MTV UK captured a young Pete Doherty in the queue in London), and HMV issued special certificates to first-day buyers. Magazine sales were predicated on their access to to the band, a valuable commodity that could easily disappear at the first sign of dissent, as evidenced by the album’s desperate and ingratiating reviews: “Oasis’ third LP is a veritable rock’n’roll monsoon of an album; a giant jigsaw puzzle, an elemental force, a monster that cannot and will not be contained,” claimed Vox. “Dem a come fe mess up de area seeeeeeeerious,” suggested Charles Shaar Murray in Mojo. Q actually called it “cocaine set to music,” which was about the only factual statement amid the lashings of hyperbole. Of the many cultural changes that Be Here Now triggered, the shift in power from the music press to marketing men may be the most toxic and enduring.What sounded like a dog’s dinner in 1997 sounds no better on this 2016 remaster, which remains one of the most agonizing listening experiences in pop music. It’s not necessarily the songs—Noel Gallagher’s way with a hook is diminished, but passable enough to make “do you know what I mean, yeah yeah” feel sticky and semi-poignant. Even “Stand By Me” is genuinely touching. But the mix is gristle to Definitely Maybe’s fillet. There were reportedly up to 50 channels of guitar on each of Be Here Now’s tracks, sometimes coupled with a 36-piece orchestra, the effect evoking something like hell churning around a cement mixer, or agonizing indigestion. Aside from a two-minute reprise of a nine-minute song, the shortest track is 5:13. It boasts more key changes than a single series of “X Factor.” The morse code blips in “D’You Know…” supposedly spell out “bugger all.” A toilet appears to flush at the end of the title track. “In the first week, someone tried to score an ounce of weed, but instead got an ounce of cocaine,” said co-producer Owen Morris. “Which kind of summed it up.” After the two massive shows at Knebworth, there was nowhere left for them to go. The lyrics are jaded about success and filled with a foreboding sense that nothing’s set to last. (And they only add to one of pop’s greatest mysteries: How can two such naturally funny men be so bereft of lyrical talent?)It’s easy to write off Oasis given what they became, but as the forthcoming documentary Supersonic makes clear, they were irresistibly magnetic in the early days. Their god-given wit and lack of inhibitions had even made traditional rock star excess into a guilty pleasure for fans who knew better than to buy into the cliche of throwing televisions out of windows. Be Here Now was the flipside of that Faustian pact, trading a generation’s communal optimism for empty calls-to-arms. Noel, at least, realized this and was doing down the record months prior to its August release. “It’s rocking but it’s not innovative,” he said in February ’97. “There’s no new ideas going on. It’s just us.” Within a few years, he admitted that he had been “making records to justify spending fucking thousands on drugs.” This reissue contains “NG’s 2016 Rethink” of “D’You Know What I Mean,” though that’s the only reworked track. “Someone (I can’t remember who) had the idea that we revisit, re-edit the entire album for posterity’s sake,” he said in a press release. “We got as far as the first track before we couldn’t be arsed anymore and gave up.”So why bother reissuing a record so shit that it never even became a cult classic, that its warring creators can’t even be bothered with it? (Other than to flog £100 vinyl box sets, that is.) There are two-and-a-half hours of bonus materials here, few of them essential and most of them familiar: B-sides, demos, and live tracks—including the live debut of “My Big Mouth” at Knebworth, which somehow sounds better than the studio recording despite being recorded in the midst of a mob. Of most interest are the previously unheard and surprisingly fleshed out demos that Noel cut while on holiday in Mustique with Kate Moss and Johnny Depp (who plays slide guitar on grim blues pastiche “Fade In\\/Out”). In a sense, this turgid collection is the ultimate expression of Be Here Now: as bloated and indulgent as the record itself, the music a secondary concern to the product’s status.It wasn’t just the end of Oasis’ imperial period, but the record industry’s as well. Ten days after the album came out, Princess Diana was killed in a car accident, shifting the national mood towards mass grief and mawkish sentimentality. Britpop receded to make way for a more humble kind of rock star in the likes of Travis and Coldplay. Although Oasis rightly questioned the absurd wave of national mourning, they also, in some backflip of contrarianism, started dedicating “Live Forever” to Diana at their autumn ’97 gigs. There was a lavish stage setup at these shows, with the band entering and departing through a giant phone box. The echoes of “Doctor Who”’s time-traveling Tardis were unavoidable: Oasis belonged to the past now.\"],[22445,\"In Isaac Asimov’s short story “Runaround,” a robot in 2015 AD named Speedy becomes caught in a feedback loop; programmed to follow the laws of robotics, it becomes disabled when a command from a human (law no. 2) puts its own existence at risk (law no. 3). Stuck between the moral principles that guide it, the robot oscillates between being close enough to danger to require retreat and being far enough that it deems it safe to carry out its orders. Drunk off the cognitive dissonance, its speech becomes nonsensical, and Speedy becomes unable to accept new commands.In the summer of 2014 AD, Roberto Carlos Lange, fresh off a tour performing as Helado Negro in support of his 2014 album Double Youth, was exhausted and weary about his future. St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch had just announced that there would be no indictment of the officer that killed Michael Brown, and Lange watched as his country publicly fractured along racial lines, wondering where he fit in. A child of Ecuadorian immigrants, the Florida-born musician had a decidedly pluralistic American experience, straddling both the old world and the new while never being fully accepted by either. Unfamiliar and uncomfortable with the idea of being on the front lines and protesting in the street, he looked inward, and started writing songs. The songs he sat down to write would become Private Energy, Helado Negro’s fifth LP. The quandary faced by Asimov’s robot Speedy—a being conflicted by contradictions in his own identity—is mirrored by Lange’s experience. “Runaround,” one of the first cuts he wrote for Private Energy, is directly inspired by Asimov’s story, and even cribs some of its lyrics from Speedy’s nonsensical musings (“Hot dog, let’s play games\\/You catch me and I catch you\\/no love can cut our knife in two”). Lange has recorded music under a few monikers—Epstein, OMBRE, his own name—but for the last decade, he’s used the Helado Negro project to explore his sense of self. From his debut Awe Owe through Double Youth, most of his lyrics have been in Spanish, and most of his shows performed for people who speak English. It’s a quirk of the Latin diaspora, with artists such as Algódon Egipcio, Xenia Rubinos, and Ela Minus sharing the experience of finding an English-speaking audience for their Spanish-language music. For Lange, it helps that sonically, the album might be his most accessible yet; half the lyrics are in English, and the abstract sound sculptures that dotted his earlier work are carefully arranged into an orderly sequence as instrumental interludes (“Obra Uno”-“Obra Cuatro”). He takes license with his Spanish, twisting words and phrases to fit his melodies, and he changes the gender of his perspective (“porque soy una mujer\\/porque sigo siendo tu hombre”) as easily as his adjectives (“tus ojos tan claras”). It’s difficult to find artists with a comparable sound, but the puzzle pieces feel familiar—some Blood Orange horns here, some Peter Bjorn and John bass there, even a dash of some Erlend Øye synths. The music is confident but unaggressive; Even as he experiments with abrasive textures that wouldn’t sound out of place on an Arca record (“Mi Mano”), the songs are draped in a shimmering sheen. The album is anchored by Lange’s soothing croon; it’s not hard to hear echoes of Julio Jaramillo, a “sappy Ecuadorean crooner” that was a favorite of his father’s. He plays guitar and the keys, samples records, live players, and field recordings, manipulating them beyond recognition and arranging them in pop song structures, and with considerably more skill than on 2009’s Spanish-language beach soundtrack Awe Owe. Lange’s songwriting process has always been a solitary one—even when he collaborates, players will track music and then leave him to his own devices, to assemble the puzzle pieces. And while every Helado Negro record has been made at Lange’s home, he spent most of 2015 workshopping Private Energy in public. The songs were essentially finished in January 2015, but he took them on the road—including nine dates with Sufjan Stevens—pulling feedback from the crowd’s energy in real-time, fine-tuning the compositions. He used a $50,000 prize from the Joyce Foundation to help fund an 18-piece ensemble in St. Paul, Minnesota, working with his composer friends Jason Ajemian and Trey Pollard to meticulously arrange his oeuvre for the big stage. Seasoned from a year on the road, he finally re-recorded the Private Energy songs in January 2016. Private Energy may gaze inward, but its themes are rooted in these connections with others. When he sings of waking up feeling “Young, Latin and Proud,” that pride and power is rooted in a shared history and culture. He has an intimate relationship with the skin that covers his body, but it’s an experience shared by every brown person on earth. He seeks to reconcile the transference of energy involved in recording and performing music (“We Don’t Have Time for That”) and the celebration of everything about being Latinx that feels great, terrible, or even just confusing. That same dark skin that protects him from the sun’s rays makes him vulnerable; too dark for white people, too light for black people, his Spanish too foreign for some Americans but too gringo outside the U.S. This desire to connect with others is fundamental, but it’s the parts we choose to share that define our relationships and, ultimately, ourselves. On “Transmission Listen,” Lange sings paradoxical couplets to a lover as starry synths twinkle in the background (“And I feel invincible without your wisdom\\/But I feel invisible without your wit”). Human ingenuity has joined them via satellite, but they can’t be honest enough with each other to actually come together. Here, and throughout the album, he probes the depths of his own psyche, masking the painful process with a velvet voice. Lange seems to be asking if it’s even possible to let other people in without first reconciling your own identity. Which parts should be private, and which parts should be shared? He’s caught in between the incongruous parts of himself, and the sentiment permeates the entirety of Private Energy. \"],[22484,\"2014 was a banner year for DJ Mustard. He released his debut album, 10 Summers, scored seven Top 15 hits on the rap charts—among them Big Sean’s “I Don’t Fuck With You,” Tinashe’s “2 On,” and Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em”—and his mere presence spawned Iggy Azalea’s “Fancy,” a blatant copy of his sound and aesthetic. He became ubiquitous. In the midst of mainstream notoriety, perhaps his greatest achievement was YG’s My Krazy Life, a cohesive gangsta rap epic that he co-executive produced alongside the Compton rapper, his longtime friend. The album solidified both artists as West Coast rap revivalists, bringing new flavor to decades of SoCal and Bay Area rap tradition, and it jumpstarted Mustard’s run, which was capped by Omarion’s platinum hit “Post to Be” that November. But things went sour for Mustard in the following months: The hit-well dried up, he was sued twice—by producer Mike Free for credits on 20 of Mustard’s hits and by BMG Rights Management over the rights to “Post to Be”—and he and YG had a falling out over money, exchanging threats on social media.This year, DJ Mustard quietly bounced back, mending bridges and retooling the sounds of his patented “ratchet music,” which has often been dismissed for its simplicity and lack of variety, into something with more range. After landing one of the biggest hits of his career with Rihanna’s “Needed Me” and joining her on her worldwide tour, he settled the lawsuit with Free and reconciled with YG, prepping a mixtape with the latter called 400 Summers. While that tape has yet to materialize, he’s returned with a new full-length album, Cold Summer, another seasonal release that brings the bangers.The entire concept behind Mustard’s debut was that he had enough hits to run rap for 10 summers straight. But summer also embodies a vibe for Mustard, representative of his native Los Angeles. His music is well-suited for the season with isolated synth stabs, sub-rattling bass lines, and dance-friendly tempos. It’s warm, candy-painted, and radio ready. Every summer since 2013, he’s released a project—Ketchup, 10 Summers, and 10 Summers: The Mixtape Vol. 1. Cold Summer is a late entry (hence the name) that attempts to continue the custom, letting big-name guests mingle with his Pushaz Ink stand-ins. But where past projects were flexes for his brand or promotional tools for his friends and artists, this record just feels humbled and appreciative. It’s fitting that Cold Summer opens with “Been a Long Time,” a reunion with longtime collaborators YG and Ty Dolla $ign. The lyrics reflect their bond and their come-up, with YG rapping, “Three Musketeers back together and they winning\\/And they getting too much money\\/Turn niggas rich then the crew must love me.” On the closer, “Another Summer,” which ditches solo riffs for a serene synth wash, Rick Ross seemingly speaks for Mustard with bars like “Look me in my eyes and tell me what you see\\/You watch the homie come up from a mustard seed\\/Ain’t looking for no problems, just a chance to eat\\/And I make mama a promise I’m a plant my feet.” In a monologue, Mustard gives the CliffsNotes version of his year, outlining his triumphs, his misfires, how happy he is to be reunited with YG and how thankful he is to be rich. Everything that happens between these two songs seems celebratory in response to these victories.Some songs, like the Nicki Minaj and Jeremih-featuring “Don’t Hurt Me” and the unlikely Quavo and YG tag-teamer “Want Her,” are designed specifically with the old blueprint in mind—snaps, claps, “heys,” twittering hi-hats, and booming bass. But much of Cold Summer is a subtle departure from the production that led to the reductive yet understandable “DJ Mustard’s Piano” meme. On “What These Bitches Want,” full piano chords and synth strings give way to rich, G-funky production while Meek Mill and Nipsey Hussle recount street tales from their respective hoods. The Ty Dolla $ign solo joint, “Lil Baby,” is sparse with twangy licks that build around the crooner’s performance. Mustard has always shown much more competence laying R&B tracks (like “2 On,” Trey Songz’ “Na Na,” and Ty’s “Paranoid”), and the standout is “10,000 Hours,” a showcase for London singer Ella Mai that turns the Malcolm Gladwell method into a formula for perfect romance.Cold Summer doesn’t dazzle on sheer star power the way a Khaled album can, and there isn’t anything as delightfully weird as DJ Drama’s sex-shooter collab “Camera” with Lil Uzi Vert, Mac Miller, and Post Malone, but it consistently jams; it knows what it is, and it never attempts to do too much. It isn’t quite as infectious as his debut, and it may not have the punchy, radio-friendly appeal of his freelance work, but it feels like a win.\"],[22466,\"Around the time when Opeth were recording their second album Morningrise, they formed Steel, a tribute to the ’80s speed metal they grew up with. They only released one EP, Heavy Metal Machine, and its cheekiness and obvious nostalgic air (that stuff was already ancient in 1996!) did not obscure the fact that Mikael Åkerfeldt is a legit shredder. Dan Swanö, Opeth’s producer at the time and former mastermind of Edge of Sanity, sounded legit charming, like Brian Johnson trying his hand at AOR. Steel felt like dudes just kicking it, which is something you would never say about Opeth. Åkerfeldt has moved away from metal and fully embraced progressive rock with Opeth’s more recent albums, but their 12th full-length, Sorceress brings to mind Steel’s carefree attitude as much as Genesis and King Crimson. They’ve never sounded more comfortable with their full-on prog transition, which works both for and against themHeritage signaled their shift into progressive rock five years ago, and 2014’s Pale Communion further solidified the transition, but Opeth is still largely thought of as a progressive metal band. Åkerfeldt's growls don’t appear here, and even though five years have gone by, it still takes some getting used to. It’s one of the challenges of considering modern-day Opeth: for all of their merits, the first time we heard “Demon of the Fall” (one of the few ’90s songs they still play live) is hard to block out. Sorceress’ strongest moments are when the metal creeps back in ever so slightly. Even with the death metal gone, they can’t put away their Deep Purple records. The title track begins with an electric piano boogie that gives way into a chugging rhythm. Chug? On an Opeth record? By restraining the crunch to give space for Åkerfeldt's vocals, it actually works. “Sorceress” acts as a nod to American progressive metal bands who took from Opeth’s more metal moments.In the dueling organ and guitars of “Chrysalis,” you could be tricked into thinking they’re moving back towards metal for a minute. “Era” recalls Rush’s earlier hard rock days, with Åkerfeldt’s croon more soothing than Geddy Lee’s wail. While he’s no Neal Peart, Martin Axenrot’s business gives that song a metal life while not being explicitly such. Hell, acoustic intro “Persephone” wouldn’t be too out of place on an At the Gates record. Opeth need not cater to those who tuned out after Heritage; still, those glimpses of familiarity account for most of the record’s real highlights.Opeth’s contrasts between death metal and clean refrains were a hallmark of their sound, but frankly, some of their transitions from death metal to clean refrains were clunky, to say the least. Their new direction has largely solved that issue in terms of inter-song dynamics, but, as with Heritage and Communion, they still struggle with maintaining momentum. Right after “Chrysalis,” “Sorceress 2” and “The Seventh Sojourn” bog the record down. Indulgence is not the crime; Sorceress proves Åkerfeldt has embraced control, and there’s nothing like the 20-minute “Black Rose Immortal” from Morningrise again. But “Sorceress 2” is a pointless acoustic interlude that doesn’t really serve as a continuation of “Sorceress.” It’s adrift, whereas “Sorceress” is assured and steady. “Sojourn” is the bigger offender, with its vaguely Middle Eastern percussion and acoustic guitars. If Opeth took pieces of “Sojourn” apart, they could make some really strong songs out of them—the drums would go great with the crunch of the title track, and the strings might not even so bad if there were some other active force competing against it.Even more shameful is that they’re followed by “Strange Brew,” the most convincing argument for Opeth abandoning metal. “Sojourn” awkwardly attempted to go psychedelic; “Strange Brew” does it effortlessly. There’s enough guitar flash and bombast characteristic of modern prog bands, yet Åkerfeldt knows how to hold back, cutting in with his somber voice just as he and Fredrik Åkesson start to get hyperactive. The soft piano that leads it off syncs better with “Chrysalis”’ ending, so it’s clear those two tracks work together side by side—it’s as if they forgot to remove all the rough sketches in between. Opeth have gotten better at self-editing with Sorceress; still, their jammier tendencies fail them in the album’s lackadaisical middle, showing they may just be a little too cool. Giving Steel another go just might inspire them to find the right balance of looseness and rigor.\"],[22429,\"Moses Sumney came to the 2016 Pitchfork Festival with a guitar, some effects pedals, and not much else. He truly didn’t need more than his voice—a wafting, pitch-perfect falsetto that floats around space before tunneling deep into your soul. I remember watching his performance from the crowd, mesmerized by how he constructed such a gorgeous mosaic without over-the-top theatrics. Sumney stood up there alone, cracking a few jokes along the way, unpacking his methodical blend of electro-soul and folk. His vocals are so strong that he never has to form actual words; Sumney’s voice is its own instrument, a stunning mixture of Prince and Bilal, set against a rustic sonic backdrop the likes of Beck and Sufjan Stevens.Over the past few years, though, Sumney hasn’t given us much to absorb. He’ll drop a song or EP here and there, but not yet a full-length album. But when Sumney does put out new work, it tends to stick with you: “Seeds,” a lo-fi campfire song, has a transformative quality that kicks in when the chorus hits. “How can I reconcile the seed\\/Once sown but never grown in me?” He follows the question with an exasperated moan, as if crushed under the weight of self-imposed pressure. On “Everlasting Sigh,” Sumney brightens the mood, emitting a regal aesthetic: “If you’re a god, made from a god\\/Let your whispered word be divine.” Sumney is an intricate writer who pens fiercely introspective songs, all of which play like the innermost thoughts of a fiercely private man. They’re sometimes weaved within layers of synthetic sound, forcing you to lean in a little closer to decipher the meaning.On “Worth It,” a highlight of Sumney’s new five-track collection Lamentations EP, the singer takes on an alien-like quality, filtering his voice through a heavily-pitched vocoder to effuse a supernatural energy. The video is equally resonant. In it, Sumney mostly lurks in the shadows, reaching out toward a mysterious figure that he eventually holds in his arms. Despite the visual and aural effects, “Worth It” is a love song on which Sumney grapples with his own self-worth. “You accept all I do,” he croons, “but I don’t know if that is wise.” Sumney isn’t saying anything that hasn’t been said by other musicians, but when he sings it, his voice feels much closer to the words.“Lonely World,” with its resounding bounce and layered wails, might be Sumney’s best song yet. It features Thundercat on bass but, in this instance, he disappears within Sumney’s majestic vocal arrangement. The song builds quickly, each note piled atop the next, composing a massive wall of noise. It’s the clear centerpiece of Lamentations, which in turn is an album that offers another brief glimpse into Sumney’s world. But in what’s become the norm for him, the music breezes by too quickly, leaving just another snippet of the singer's potential. Maybe that’s the idea? Who knows. Sumney is elusive that way.\"],[22451,\"The best of Phish’s music aims for transcendence. It’s at the heart of any jam band, or really, any kind of improvisatory outfit: an attempt to find language beyond language, to go somewhere you could not go alone. It’s why the length of any given Phish song in concert might stretch deep into the double-digits, and why their loyal legion of fans feel an instinctual desire to see as many of their shows as possible. Despite their massive audience, Phish remain a countercultural force, and their goofy, shroomy jams resonate as an aural rejection of the monotonous sobriety of suburban adolescence. For much of Phish’s fans, the band is akin to the class clown who’s also the smartest kid in the room. Their energy is infectious and vital; when you’re with them, you feel better about yourself. It’s an escapist fantasy.On Big Boat, the band’s thirteenth album, Phish openly promises salvation from the get-go. In “Friends,” the dumb-as-rocks, vaguely triumphant opening number, drummer Jon Fishman forecasts the coming of the Lord, descending upon the Earth in “some fiery fashion.” But Fishman offers an alternate exit, escaping to the hills and collecting his like-minded compatriots aboard the titular “big boat.” As an opener, it offers a mission statement not dissimilar to My Morning Jacket’s “Victory Dance,” an enthusiastic, if overly simplistic song aimed squarely at the already-initiated. Keyboardist Page McConnell bashes dramatically along his keyboard, like a parody of Roy Bittan on Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell, as Fishman’s toms roll and Trey Anastasio’s fingers glide along his fretboard. Incessant and noisy, “Friends” opens Big Boat with the promise of a Phish album armed with purpose and energy.That is not the album that follows. Big Boat is at times overwrought and half-assed, gratingly silly and embarrassingly self-serious, both tedious and underwhelming. In other words, it’s a new Phish album. Even still, the lowest points of Big Boat manage to sink lower than just being bad-for-Phish; Big Boat is made even worse by not sounding enough like Phish. The turgid prog-pop of “Waking Up Dead” could be mistaken for any number of anonymous, post-Phish, local jam acts. “Tide Turns,” with its nauseating Jimmy Buffett sleaze, doesn’t even fail for Phish trying to sound like a soul group; it’s more akin to members of Phish begrudgingly joining a wedding band. Somewhere along the way, you get your expected share of underwritten ballads, overly complicated funk wipeouts, and multiple tracks whose runtimes come suspiciously close to the 4:20 mark.If you love Phish, the release of a solid studio album has likely never been a requirement to stay onboard, even when their releases were fun and relatively consistent, like 1996’s Billy Breathes. Had Big Boat never been released, the live staple “Blaze On” would still find its way to their blissed-out crowds, as it has on the last several tours. And while “Blaze On” is no latter-day classic like, say, “So Many Roads,” its inclusion here and on their setlist does represent an example of Phish updating their repertoire without resorting to the tried-and-true album-and-single cycles they’ve always existed squarely outside of. As such, Phish exist in a number gray areas. They are an indie-minded band with mainstream appeal; a classic rock group who rejects the genre’s radio-focused populism; an enormously competent outfit who use their expertise to promote their euphoric brand of anti-intellectualism. If Phish were to embrace their unique position in the industry, one could imagine them penning albums that were, if not definitive, then at least approaching coherence, like modern-day Wilco, or Phish tourmates Ween. Instead, Big Boat is another failure in a discography full of them. Without a unifying identity, it whiffs on nearly every statement it tries to make. For a group of musicians whose sole value has always been the simple pleasure of making music, the members of Phish sound noticeably vacant in these recordings.Still, none of the album’s weaknesses (like McConnell rhyming “losing my interest” with “just scanning Pinterest”) would be half as disappointing if Phish weren’t almost aging gracefully. The last several years have had some undeniable high points—from the simple, nostalgic rock of 2009’s Joy through 2014’s Fuego, easily the band’s most inspired record since the ’90s. On Big Boat, they come up with a few winning moments. Trey’s guitar solos throughout the otherwise rote balladry of “Miss You” are genuinely moving in a way his humdrum vocals and plainspoken lyrics could never be. McConnell’s “I Always Wanted It This Way” is the album’s peak, a defiant Motorik jam that wouldn’t sound out of place on a 21st-century Yo La Tengo album. The album closes strikingly with “Petrichor,” an immaculately arranged prog opus. It might not be a track to convince the naysayers (or even, with its thirteen-minute runtime, to necessarily warrant a second play). But it’s the only moment on the album when Phish shows—and not just tells—that transcendence is possible, and that they’re willing to go there with us.\"],[22471,\"You’ve got to hand it to Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter for their work ethic. In the past nine years, they’ve transformed their duo Phantogram from an indie trip-hop venture à la Dead Can Dance to the most monolithic, festival-ready pop project on Republic’s roster. They’ve refined the core sound of Barthel’s powerhouse alto vocals and Carter’s glitchy arrangements to a diamond tip and embraced a blossoming interest in collaboration: from Miley Cyrus to Skrillex to OutKast’s Big Boi (who tapped Phantogram for multiple tracks on his 2012 album Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors, and later recorded an EP with them under the name Big Grams). With their audience and creative network steadily expanding, the duo is bound for the mainstream–which, of course, means they’ve got to prove themselves all over again.Phantogram’s latest album, Three, arrives under a pall. This past January, Barthel’s older sister (who was close friends with Carter as well) took her own life, a personal trauma that hovered over the sessions. Granted, the duo has always thrived in the shadows, having relied heavily on stark backbeats and gloomy synths for previous nocturnal anthems like 2009’s “Turn it Off” and 2014’s aptly-titled “Black Out Days.” But expressing such a deep loss through music takes finesse, something that Phantogram accomplish only unevenly on Three.Between brooding, vulnerable cuts like “Barking Dog” and punchier offerings like “Run Run Blood,” Three often feels less like an album and more like postcards from the eye of an emotional hurricane. This is partly due to the album’s formidable supporting cast: R&B maestros the-Dream and Tricky Stewart and pop strongman Ricky Reed (Meghan Trainor, Jason Derulo) all show up in the credits. And yet, excepting Reed’s clearly visible fingerprints on the trunk-rattling tour-de-force “You Don’t Get Me High Anymore,” it’s hard to sort out these producers’ exact contributions on Three. Phantogram’s vaporous sound is as prevalent as ever, with Barthel’s airy runs and Carter’s turgid samples lending a weightless, fever-dream quality to “Answer” and “You’re Mine.”However alluring their atmospherics, these mid-tempo cuts (of which Three contains far too many) pale in comparison to the aforementioned single, the album’s greatest draw and Phantogram’s finest song to date. Never before have the duo sounded so animated, self-assured, or synchronized. Barthel effortlessly alternates between half-rapped verses and cooed hooks, with Carter meeting every vocal pivot with a blast of bass (the funky, ad-lib on the second verse is a particularly nice touch), a frigid synth melody, or a distorted guitar riff. The rest of the album’s expansive epics are built on a shaky foundations, with too many songs that contain too many concepts for their own good. Consider “Run Run Blood”—an unwieldy bricolage of dub grooves, breakbeats, plaintive guitars, ambient interludes, and ham-fisted lyrics about “falling into a swarm of bees” that give me The Wicker Man flashbacks every time I hear it. Shortly after delivering that howler, Barthel gestures to the big picture, literally: (“It’s bigger than life\\/It’s bigger than love\\/It’s bigger than us\\/Bigger than all”). She never specifies what it is, exactly, but the logical answer would be some kind of morbid sublimity that Phantogram strive for and, alas, fail to detail.\"],[22470,\"Ambient music has a habit of all running together, but on 2011’s An Empty Bliss Beyond This World, James Leyland Kirby devised a series of ways to stand out. He invoked the purgatorial ballroom of The Shining with his project’s name, the Caretaker; layered it with Alzheimer’s studies; and spun it through loopy, languid edits of Jazz Age 78s. The results were soothing to the ear, lucid to the imagination, and rich with historical feeling, all unified in a meditation on degradation, memory, and time. There was also an implied provocation in Kirby’s sweet, almost jaunty treatment of losing one’s mind. Ambient masterpieces like Empty Bliss often cause me to think, “I’d take six more albums of that.” But in the event, I’m not as sure.Everywhere at the End of Time has been planned as a six-stage release. The first three will come out as downloads and LPs between now and next year, when they will also be compiled in a CD set; the last three follow the same pattern from March 2018 to 2019. The premise is that the Caretaker, one of Kirby’s long-running aliases, has been diagnosed with early onset dementia. The music will chart the patient’s decline, ending in the alter ego’s “death.” Memory, incarnated as resurfacing bits of music from throughout the Caretaker’s oeuvre, will progressively smear and recombine. In short, it’s an extreme continuation of what Kirby did on Empty Bliss, his most popular release to date: lingering on the precipice where pleasant reverie slips into the abyss. As on that album, pitches laze, overtones huff and puff, lines elongate, surface noise crackles, and scratches slash out a rhythmic rain. But mainly, the loops just play, stuck somewhere between dreamlike and deathly, until suddenly, ominously, they stop. Roaring Twenties horns turn from saucy to sloe-eyed, poky and dopey, as if a heavily opiated combo kept losing its place in a Gershwin tune.  “Here we experience the first signs of memory loss,” Kirby writes in liner notes. “This stage is most like a beautiful daydream. The glory of old age and recollection. The last of the great days.” But we begin to hear more severe signs of breakdown around halfway through it. On “Slightly Bewildered,” the instrumentation becomes an almost toneless mooing, the loop wrapping around with a stagger. “Things That Are Beautiful and Transient” is inside-out, the melody an inner voice, its harmonic field the foreground. A winning gentleness pervades later tracks like “An Autumnal Equinox” and “The Loves of My Entire Life,” but by the end, even gentleness has taken on a desperate tinge, as though if the dancing stops, everyone dies. It’s a testament to Kirby’s cunning composition that it sounds like he’s playing long stretches of the source material intact, when in fact, he is drastically altering tiny snippets and composing them into smeared but credible pieces. He mulches and reconstitutes an era, but he is not very interested in historical footnotes. He’ll talk a lot about process and concept, but you have to turn to Who Sampled to tell you that, say, the title track of Empty Bliss is derived from Layton and Johnstone’s 1929 recording of “The Wedding of the Painted Doll.” As Kirby goes all in on this coup de grâce, one can’t help but notice that he’s using other people’s music to channel the subjectivity of other people’s medical condition, and wonder where that gets us.  Empty Bliss rested on studies of Alzheimer’s patients and music, which seemed to keep a respectful distance from real, specific suffering. But there is something a little unseemly about Kirby “giving the project dementia” and reveling in it across hours of pleasurable music, especially after he announced it in such a confusing way that he had to clarify that he himself had not been diagnosed with dementia. If not exploitative, it’s at least an unduly romantic view of an illness. We like to dabble in madness through music, in the abstract. But an actual disease? Why should we want to experience dementia by proxy, aesthetically, or think we even can? I watched my grandmother succumb to it for a decade before she died, and it was very little like a “beautiful daydream.” In fact, there was nothing aesthetic about it.\"],[22437,\"The Pixies weren’t the only band that blazed the trail for alternative rock’s mainstream takeover in the ’90s, but they were the rare band that got to be trailblazers twice. When they regrouped at Coachella in 2004 after an 11-year breakup, they effectively ushered in another musical phenomenon: the indie-icon reunion-tour circuit. It granted the Massachusetts misfits a long overdue opportunity to play for the sort of massive crowds that their famous fans—Nirvana, Radiohead, and Weezer among them—had built on their influence. But what was once a valorous underdog-victory narrative has slowly turned into a cautionary tale about pissing away all the goodwill you’ve accrued.For the rest of the 2000s, the Pixies toured and toured as if they were on a mission to perform for every last person on Earth who longed to hear “Debaser” in the flesh. By the time they finally decided to release new music again in 2013, not only was bassist Kim Deal gone, so too was any lingering excitement about the prospect of new Pixies music. What’s more, the three scatterbrained EPs they issued between 2013 and 2014—later compiled and reshuffled in album form as Indie Cindy—only served to answer those deflated expectations with a collection of songs that overcompensated for their lack of vigor and volatility by amping up the egregious eccentricity.And yet despite that misfire, not to mention an aborted attempt to replace Deal with another Kim, the Pixies are giving it another go. With bassist Paz Lenchantin (A Perfect Circle, the Entrance Band) now officially sworn in, Head Carrier feels like an attempt to stabilize their course. The Pixies are no longer the legends resurfacing with their first album in 20 years; they’re just a steady-as-she-goes rock band cranking out another record. With Head Carrier, they’re essentially in their Voodoo Lounge phase, turning in the sort of middling, late-career album that will clog up the Pixies bin at your local record store when you’re looking to upgrade your worn-out copy of Surfer Rosa.If Head Carrier has no ambitions to be a return to a form, it at least doesn’t incite the same sort of facepalm incredulity as Indie Cindy. (Seriously: what the fuck was “Bagboy”?) On tuneful songs like “Classic Masher” and “Might As Well Be Gone,” you can hear traces of the band that made “Here Comes Your Man” and “Velouria.” But there’s scant evidence of the band that made “Vamos” or “Gouge Away”—the volcanic outbursts that made their more melodic songs shine like diamonds in the coal.The tension points that once made the Pixies so singular and striking—tiki-torched calm vs. eyeball-slicing chaos, sweetness vs. psychosis, American mythology vs. Spanish surrealism—have been thoroughly massaged out by this point. Yes, Kim Deal is missed, but so are Black Francis’ frightening mood swings, Joey Santiago’s blazing grease-rag guitars, and Dave Lovering’s concrete-cracking stomps. These Pixies are happy to just twang and jangle instead of slash and burn; on those rare occasions when they do try to rip up the asphalt (“Baal’s Back,” “Um Chagga Laga”), they sound less like ticking time-bomb terrors drunk on Dali and David Lynch than a mildly cranky Tex-Mex bar band.As futile as it may be to hold the current Pixies up to the standard of records they made nearly 30 years ago, the comparisons are unavoidable given that they’re still executing the same playbook, only with less enthusiasm. Lenchantin is called on to do everything Kim Deal used to do, but while her plainspoken delivery is genial enough, it doesn’t exude the mischievous glee that made her predecessor such an effective balm to Francis’ tonsil-shredding howls. And given that Francis doesn’t get all that worked up about much here, the contrast between the two is muted—she’s more harmonic support than a full-on foil.As such, Lenchantin’s lead vocal debut as a Pixie, “All I Think About Now,” is less notable for her performance than the lyrics Francis gave her to sing. Opening with an unsubtle echo of “Where Is My Mind?,” the song serves as Francis’ thank-you note to Deal, a fond remembrance of their working relationship to dispel the long-rumored animosity between the two. That sort of candor and poignancy are rare qualities in the Pixies canon—and credit Lenchantin, who came up with the lyrical concept, for nudging Francis into this uncharted terrain. But the singing-telegram approach feels sort of like, well, quitting your band by fax.The truth is, if Head Carrier had arrived as the umpteenth Frank Black solo album, little about it would seem amiss. But coming from a band whose legacy was built on shock-and-awe transgression, Head Carrier feels overly pleasant and pedestrian. I’m reminded of that infamous Steve Albini interview from the early ’90s where the Surfer Rosa producer called his former clients “a band who, at their top-dollar best, are blandly entertaining college rock.” At the time, the quote seemed like blasphemy. Now, it feels like prophecy.\"],[22475,\"Francis Farewell Starlite, the creative force behind the contemporary R&B project Francis and the Lights, has always been billed as somewhat of a self-made pop star, a man who bucks record labels and all their corporate trappings for unchecked artistic freedom. Over the last decade, he’s released a string of EPs and one album (2010’s eclectic It’ll Be Better) all under his own imprint, toured with a line of pop acts from Drake to Kesha, and guested as a vocalist or a producer with a procession of influential artists including Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book and Frank Ocean’s Blonde. Clearly, you don’t accumulate this kind this kind of resume without a perceived sense of individuality and vision, which is why the stakes seem high six years after the group’s debut LP. While not totally missing the mark, Farewell, Starlite! doesn't quite live up to those expectations either, a shortcoming that is further compounded by Starlite’s many intriguing triumphs on other people’s records.All of Starlite’s signature production is present, from swollen synthesizers to super-processed vocal overlays. Opener “See Her Out (That’s Just Life)” shifts from squelchy keyboard stabs to the quiet introspection of Starlite’s falsetto in the chorus. While it succeeds in setting the tone for the rest of the album, it’s a sound that is replicated so often in subsequent songs that after only one full listen, it’s lost its show-stopping power. Turning an album of similar-sounding tracks into a solid, encapsulating block of music takes astounding finesse—doubly so for pop music. The majority of Farewell, Starlite! is something along the lines of James Blake’s stoic pondering and Blood Orange’s futuristic soul, but less compelling. By seeking to avoid both mainstream bombast and underground obscurity, Francis and the Lights have landed squarely in the middle with a safe and uninspired choices.Farewell, Starlite! is not without its pleasures. The album’s focus is, rightfully, “Friends,” a collaboration with Justin Vernon of Bon Iver and Kanye West. It’s a deeply affecting, mellow slice of alternative R&B, gliding along on a placid sea of finger snaps and interlocking vocal harmonies by all three artists, like some impossibly cool barbershop trio. When Starlite sings, “We could be friends\\/Just put your head on my shoulders,” it’s lusher than velvet. It sounds more like a lovesick supplication than a call for restraint. Francis and the Lights have been compared to Peter Gabriel before, but nowhere has this been more apparent as “May I Have This Dance,” a song that truly could be added to a reissue of So without anyone batting an eyelid. Its subtle Afro-pop drumbeat and jubilant chorale of lyrics about reclaiming lost love are so evocative of mid-’80s art pop that it defiantly stands out as an example of the kind of diversity Farewell, Starlite! could desperately use more of.Surprisingly, another highlight is “Thank You,” a 90-second ballad tucked away at the very end of the album. Layered vocals create a one-man choir and Starlite’s voice shines in its strongest form yet, raw and semi-unfiltered. Towards the end, just as the song gathers momentum before fading out, he chants, “I should say thank you, thank you, thank you.” He knows he’s charmed, that he has both the talent and the connections to make music more or less on his own terms. While Farewell, Starlite! has its share of engaging moments, it’s a shame that under all its technical flairs, its overall mood isn’t gripping enough to do justice to its creator’s vision.\"],[22476,\"Ambition has long been Neurosis’ hallmark. When the Bay Area band, which started out playing crust-caked hardcore in the ’80s, turned toward longer songs and stranger textures on 1990’s The Word As Law, there was no blueprint to follow. Instead, they spent the next decade forging one barrier-obliterating album after the next. By 1999’s Time of Grace—released with an ambient companion album by Neurosis’ alter ego, Tribes of Neurot, which was meant to be played on top of Times of Grace—the group had morphed into an entity of ritualism, dark spectacle, and metaphysical sprawl. Since then, they’ve gradually whittled down their vision to a more manageable size, but even then, their prodigious albums never fell below the hour-long mark. Yet their eleventh and latest full-length—the 41-minute-long Fires Within Fires—is, by a sizable margin, their briefest album since The Word As Law came out 26 years ago.Granted, there are more ways to gauge ambition than album length. But for Neurosis, the mystique of milestones like Souls at Zero and Enemy of the Sun went hand in hand with how far they were willing to push themselves. Neurosis’ music is meant to be immersive, a labyrinth, something to be wandered into warily and only eventually escaped from. That gravity is largely lacking in Fires. Sure, the tracks are heavy as ever, from the vein-bursting riff-mongery of “Bending Light” to the more corrosive future-psychedelia of “A Shadow Memory” and “Fire Is the End Lesson.” The last features some tried-and-true, staccato-vocal interplay between guitarists Scott Kelly and Steven Von Till, but it doesn’t add up to much more than an exercise in the familiar. “Bending Light” doesn’t even properly feature Neurosis’ main strength—the layering of instruments to an inhuman degree of atmospheric density. Instead, everyone is just kind of playing at the same time. When the inevitable soft part lurches clumsily into the inevitable hard part, the loudest sound is a checklist being checked.Fires sags in both the beginning and the middle, but it ends, however lopsidedly, with a staggering exhibition of quiet power. “Broken Ground” and “Reach” are cut from whole cloth, concluding the album with a combined 20 minutes of hushed, chanted, circular folk-metal. That said, “Broken Ground” works so well because it sounds like one of Von Till’s solo songs that just so happens to be fleshed out by Neurosis. This is where the band’s heart seems to reside circa 2016—in a convocation of towering, cosmos-scraping arpeggios and eschatological warnings about “psychic waves” and “the end of all we’ve seen” that’s more Swans and Lungfish than the old sludge-and-doom routine. Why Neurosis hasn’t committed to this subtle, skeletal approach more fully on Fires is anyone’s guess, but the album suffers for that indecision. As good as these final two songs are, they’re not enough. At only 40 minutes total, Fires feels like it’s over just as it should be hitting its climax.If one of the album’s weaker tracks, like “Bending Light,” were to be removed, this would be a solid, four-song EP of the same duration and scope as 2000’s respectable Sovereign. Instead, it’s neither fish nor fowl: Fires Within Fires is a piece of music that’s too skimpy to be a full-blooded Neurosis LP and too bloated to be a lean, concentrated Neurosis EP. There’s no shame in this, but at this point in their career Neurosis are being vastly outperformed by a legion of younger bands they’ve influenced, from Pallbearer to Inter Arma to Dead to a Dying World. That doesn’t in any way diminish what Neurosis has accomplished over the decades; these younger bands have yet to touch the horrific magnificence of Neurosis’ 1996 masterpiece Through Silver in Blood. But as that album celebrates its twentieth anniversary, it’s becoming clearer that these days Neurosis are fueled less by ambition and more by reiteration.\"],[22472,\"Yves Tumor is an associate of Mykki Blanco and was a key player on last year’s C-ORE compilation. He’s also blipped up on comps from buzzworthy labels like NON and UNO and had Hippos in Tanks’ founder Barron Machat not passed away, Tumor would have been a ready-fit for that groundbreaking label, too. As it stands, Yves Tumor shares many sonic traits with the likes of HiT artists like James Ferraro and Dean Blunt. The latter is most apparent in that Tumor favors mysterious loops, soul music as rendered by the recently concussed and noise-as-loofah. The early parts of Serpent Music seem equally noncommittal in choosing which side of himself to present. Early highlight “The Feeling When You Walk Away” needs little to cast its spell: winding itself around a looping sting of R&B guitar and allowing Tumor’s gossamer voice to serve as narcotic. “Cherish” attempts something similar with another hiccuping loop, but to little effect.Minimal as those tracks are, something like “Dajjal” allows its rolling piano line to get cluttered with out-of-sync drum machine sputters and spurts of white noise, his voice lost underneath it all. For “Broke In,” Tumor again juggles a creepy close-mic whisper with footwork-fast beats and ambulance sirens, but it never quite congeals. “Role in Creation” begins promisingly enough, a strange hiccup of ethnic percussion and drum patter, only to have it do little more for the next two minutes. “Serpent I” and “II” do more with ritualistic percussion, razing it with noise and field recordings of an undetermined nature, veering into eerie spoken word, crashing cymbals, rubbed drum heads and the sound of children playing in the distance. Lo-fi noise gets coupled to a tinny drum machine and mumbled vocals on “Seed,” but over the course of its seven minutes, the feedback squalls don’t quite attain the invigorating abrasiveness of the tracks Tumor makes as Bekelé Berhanu.While it doesn’t always work, it’s Yves Tumor’s use of field recordings that gives Serpent Music an ambulatory quality. “Spirit in Prison” gets its pulse from the chatter of crows overhead, but just when it might give the track a sense of paranoia, the introduction of a female voice and harp plucks midway evokes the likes of Björk. Closer “Perdition” replicates what it’s like to walk along the docks in total darkness, with only the lapping of the waves (and a slow sine wave of bass) to console you. At times, such a sense of wandering makes the tracks feel unresolved or interrupted, but at other times it gives the sensation of being lost in a strange urban landscape, alternating between endless gray blocks and brief glints of beauty. Though given the legless nature of that titular creature, maybe Tumor revels in slithering through such sounds on his belly.\"],[22482,\"Solange Knowles turned 30 in June, and it seems clear that her Saturn Returns manifested in an artistic surge. A Seat at the Table, her third full-length album, is the work of a woman who’s truly grown into herself, and discovered within a clear, exhilarating statement of self and community that’s as robust in its quieter moments as it is in its funkier ones. Even though it’s been out less than a week, it already seems like a document of historical significance, not just for its formidable musical achievements but for the way it encapsulates black cultural and social history with such richness, generosity, and truth. To this point, Solange has been trying on styles and stretching out into her own skills as a songwriter. Having spent her early teen years singing backup and writing songs, she debuted as a solo artist at just 16, with Solo Star. Very 2003, it was a gleaming, hip-hop-informed album that slinked over beats from the likes of Timbaland and the Neptunes; even with plenty of great tracks, the production outweighed her presence. After a five-year break as a solo artist—during which she got married, had son Julez, moved to Idaho, got divorced, starred in Bring It On: All or Nothing, among other films, and wrote songs for her sister Beyoncé (whew!)—she returned in 2008 with Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams. That album was clearly immersed in a deep love of ’60s funk and soul and its attendant politics, and she rebelled against expectations (see: “Fuck the Industry”), eager to fully express her individuality. She fused her musical impulses in the easy, ebullient grooves of 2012’s True EP, which eased a glossier vision of pop into the soulfunk groove she had ingrained.Even with such an impressive resume, though, A Seat at the Table is on a different plane. It’s a document of the struggle of a black woman, and black women, in 2016, as Solange confronts painful indignities and situates them historically. Many of these songs draw from current reactions to the seemingly unending killing of black women and men at the hands of the police, but the scope of the record as a whole is much larger than that, with Civil Rights hymnals encompassing centuries of horror black Americans have been subject to, including that inflicted on Knowles’ own ancestors. But even when Solange offers her narrative in first-person and incorporates her family’s past through interludes with her mother Tina and father Mathew, she does so with such artistic and emotional openness that this album feels like nothing but a salve.The quick sketch “Rise” opens slowly, on a sweet piano and with layers of Solange’s voice in jazz modulations, as a sort of blessing and a placid encouragement to thrive despite it all. “Fall in your ways, so you can crumble,” she sings. “Fall in your ways, so you can wake up and rise.” The word “rise” lands on the high note, but the song lays out the album’s central tension between pain, pride, sorrow, and fierce dignity. This leads directly into “Weary,” a ginger, breathy document of exhaustion, and the deceptively euphoric “Cranes in the Sky,” which, taken as a “Weary”’s counterpart, illustrates two stages of sorrow. What’s so touching about “Cranes,” though—intertwined with the airy, peaceful beauty of its video—is the way Solange specifically documents her process of coping, down to the smallest escape mechanisms. On a warm bass strut, she sings about drinking, sexing, running, and spending in an effort to be free from “those metal clouds,” making visible the kinds of mundane things we all do in the service of a temporary reprieve. Naming these actions feels radical in and of itself, but by the time she flies off her own cloud of a Minnie Riperton-level aria, she seems to have freed herself from the routine, and transcended it.Solange has said that it was important to her to articulate her roots, and so along with the recordings of her parents, she made the bulk of A Seat at the Table in New Iberia, Louisiana, “based on that area being the start of everything within our family’s lineage,” the place where Tina Knowles-Lawson’s parents first met and then fled after being “run out of town.” In terms of production, her song structures, and melodies, she celebrates the whole history of black music. But the result is never derivative; when you recognize the spirits of artists like Riperton, Zapp, Angie Stone, Aaliyah (lyrically, in “Borderline (An Ode to Self Care”), Janet Jackson, Stanley Clarke, Lil Mo, Herbie freakin’ Hancock and so many more, it feels more like a musical nod or a wink. The master musician and bandleader Raphael Saadiq serves as co-producer; Saadiq meets Solange in the juiciest middle, both bridging their instincts between classic instrumentation and futuristic funk. The arrangements are voluminous, loose and tight at once, but Solange’s voice is always at the front of this proscenium; each shows restraint as they lean into her collective vision. The sound they conjure is chill-inducing, an easy sound for subject matter that’s as real and tough as it gets. The excellent “Don’t Touch My Hair” (with a feature by Sampha) and “Mad” (her second collaboration with Lil Wayne) specifically address the way black women are devalued, and the songs meet that with resistance. Solange’s voice is a palliative for the pain she describes, as she names truths to divest them of their power. A Seat at the Table offers a hearth to black women as much as it asserts Solange’s right to comfort and understanding. And in terms of her lived experience, the table of the album’s title, metaphysical and physical, rests in her home of New Orleans. In several interludes, the rapper, label head, and entrepreneur Master P threads the album with musings on No Limit’s runaway success as a black-owned record label (landed him on the Forbes list, baby). That particular segment leads into “F.U.B.U.” (\\\\\"For Us, By Us\\\\\"), a honey-dripped slow-grinder of black affirmation, with tubas that sound inspired by NOLA’s Second Lines as Solange mews, “This shit is for us\\/Don’t try to come for us.” Her sumptuous harmonies build a protective forcefield: “Some shit,” she sings, “you can’t touch.”A Seat at the Table’s nature is beneficent, but at its spiritual core it is an ode to black women and their healing and sustenance in particular; in writing about herself, Solange turns the mirror back upon them, and crystallizes the kinship therein. She harmonizes with Kelly Rowland and Nia Andrews that “I got so much magic, you can have it,” but the song that perhaps best encapsulates this outstanding work is “Scales,” a slow-burning duet with Kelela near the end of the album. Their harmonies are heavenly and create almost a meditative effect, a mantra of healing kindness in a syrup-slow synth progression. It’s a sex jam, I think, but it can also serve as a shine-theory jam. “You’re a superstar,” they sing together, letting the “star” part roll around a bit in the lower part of the vibrato. “You’re a superstar.”\"],[22376,\"Balance and Composure’s sophomore album The Things We Think We’re Missing could end up being the quintessential document of the new vanguard of old school alt-rock. In the context of its release year, 2013, this kind of aggressive guitar music actually felt like an alternative to something, and it still does. Its fanbase was too young to be embraced as “indie” (read: college) rock, and it lacked the obvious hit single or image necessary to break satellite radio. It was far too artistically and socially considerate to be aligned with the Warped Tour. Though alternative rock can no longer claim a nation, bands like B&C thrive in a sizable Twitter, Tumblr, and message board underground, where Nirvana is classic rock, Brand New is modern canon, and Neutral Milk Hotel is still a mandatory rite of passage. It’s easy to figure which bands view this space as a final destination and those who are trying to find a bridge towards the mainstream. If you couldn’t tell where Balance and Composure’s ambitions lie with Light We Made, just know this: they’re labelmates with the 1975 now.But true to form, their advancement is one that adheres to old school alt-rock ideals. Lead single “Postcard” was a surprisingly demure teaser that nonetheless felt like a big reveal, going against just about every formidable strength Balance and Composure had previously established: the riffs here are clean and hypnotic, where before they would bludgeon you into submission. Jon Simmons’ vocals are cloaked and conversational rather than a charred howl. Compared to “Reflection,” a steamroller that foretold the direction The Things We Think, “Postcard” might as well be a Prius: efficient, stylish, aimed at a more mature consumer.“Postcard” is virtually unrecognizable as Balance and Composure; it bears more than a passing similarity to Radiohead’s “I Might Be Wrong.” This being 2016 and not 2001, ambitious, young rock bands aren’t really using Radiohead as their North Star (at least not publicly). But for a lot of listeners, a certain era of Radiohead still represents the zenith of alternative rock. Think the late ’90s, maybe half of Amnesiac: a man-machine interface both tech-savvy and tech-wary, while still maintaining the look, feel, and perspective of their angstier early days.And so, Light We Made isn’t a total rebuild. Aside from a few drum triggers, synth-bass fuzz, and additions to the pedal board, Balance and Composure could play these songs live with their 2013 setup. Simmons gets occasionally chopped, screwed, and Autotuned, texturing vocals that can often lack a personal watermark. More importantly, they underscore the incremental progress of his matured perspective. Simmons still strains to make even the most worn metaphors for physical desire, but B&C manage to create a number of distinct spaces where social anxiety and self-loathing can be tempered with well-meaning amorousness. “Mediocre Love” and “Is It So Much to Adore?” hypnotically churn with startling rhythms, while “Loam” and “Fame” are more inspired takes on the Cure’s latter-day metallurgy.  Balance and Composure are a far more flexible band than they were on The Things We Think We’re Missing, which had one move: repeatedly slamming the listener into Will Yip’s brickwalled production. Yip is back on board and rightfully so, since he oversaw Title Fight’s Hyperview and Turnover’s Peripheral Vision, two of this scene’s most divisive and relatively daring dives into traditional indie rock from 2015. Neither of those bands could completely transmogrify, but the remnants of their putative DNA made each of them stand out—Title Fight’s take on shoegaze had concision and a searing intensity, whereas Turnover’s hybrid of dream-pop guitars and pointed pop-punk lyricism created a legitimately novel hybrid.The past and present of Balance and Composure can’t manage the same symbiosis. The arresting, trip-hop reverie of opener “Midnight Zone” quickly gives way to nü-bubble grunge singles that are not particularly compelling. Nowhere is the distance between Balance and Composure’s ambitions and abilities more chasmic than on “For a Walk”; it’s not too often you can use the Spawn soundtrack as a reference point, but that’s pretty much their nu-metal\\/industrial take on the lyrical thrust of Franz Ferdinand’s “Take Me Out.”A few weeks before Light We Made’s release, the band opened up about a series of terrifying van crashes that caused them to put everything on hold for a year and a half. They had remained silent so as to not draw attention to themselves or offer a juicy narrative that had nothing to do with their music. It’s admirable, and it also speaks to a lack of disclosure that pervades Light We Made. As with The Things We Think, it feels like the sound of a curious band still working out how to make music as distinct as its influences; whether lyrically or sonically, they come across as either unknowable or proudly workmanlike. Strangely, as Simmons makes a French exit on “Afterparty,” he sings, “Let your feelings show, it’s easier than you would ever know.” Yet, judging by Light We Made, it’s much harder than he thinks.\"],[22459,\"Supersilent's music exists beyond any normal human activity, any comprehensible emotion. It's hard to imagine partying, housecleaning, or commuting with it, as its screeches, melted horn riffs, and creep-show keyboards bombard the edge of reason. Its rhythms hint at continuity and then peel off in whatever direction, perversely arbitrary, shunting the flow. Imagine straining to hear a rustling through the keyhole of a door that might burst open to unleash a terrible racket at any moment—that's 13. When you listen to it, you can't really do anything but listen to it. That's an advantage if you consider it as a sign of vividness, but perhaps a limitation if you think about how often you sit by yourself and do nothing but listen intently to music. The precise numbering of Supersilent's recordings almost humorously belies their spontaneous nature—every album is improvised. On 13, the trio moves from Rune Grammofon to Oslo's other leading electronic jazz label, Smalltown Supersound, but the sequence and the style are unbroken. The group's distant roots are in free jazz, which they still stitch into abstract patchworks of ambient music and arrhythmic noise. Roughly, Arve Henriksen coaxes strange tones from trumpets and woodwinds; Ståle Storløkken pounds vintage keyboards; and Helge Sten, who also makes dark ambient music as Deathprod, at once encases and engages the improvisations with rich electro-acoustic atmospheres. 13 was performed over a PA system in a shared space, and it benefits from a sense of presence even at its most daunting.Though Supersilent has gone without a drummer since 2009, they remain a highly percussive outfit because of the pops and crackles of the electronics and the extended techniques used by the players. 13's opening track is described as \\\\\"Indonesian ritual music heard from a Scandinavian mountaintop,\\\\\" but you couldn't be blamed for imagining a rhythm section falling down the stairs into a basement full of broken computers instead. \\\\\"13.1\\\\\" lands on just the right side of the line between exploring and getting lost. Not every track does. These improvisers are good enough to bend something as unruly as \\\\\"13.3\\\\\" into an arc, but it's still a gruelingly disjunctive go at it. And on the bumptious \\\\\"13.5,\\\\\" we remember, as we wholly forget during the most captivating passages, that this is essentially just some dudes getting together and jamming.Luckily, \\\\\"13.5\\\\\" is followed by one those velvety, far-off, lyrical trumpet solos familiar from Henriksen's wonderful solo albums, and there are other songs like it here—smaller, shorter, and more subtle. Not a one is unwelcome. Aptly for such extreme music, 13 is most potent when Supersilent either goes inward, as on \\\\\"13.6,\\\\\" or goes all out, staying well clear of the noncommittal region in between. \\\\\"13.7\\\\\" might take this dictum a tad far; a screaming fireball that takes six minutes to strike spends six more wreaking almost unlistenable havoc. \\\\\"13.9\\\\\" is just as big and twice as perfect, rewarding anyone who's made it to the end with a cool-toned, hard-won, and not at all unnecessary refresher course on what music is and why people like it. That's the fascination and the frustration of Supersilent: it's like they keep destroying the lineaments of form just for the pleasure of vouchsafing them to us again.\"],[22375,\"Whenever a serial killer is arrested, there’s the inevitable doorstep interview on the nightly news with the incredulous neighbor who can’t believe such a nice, shy, quiet person could do something so evil. Bruce Haack was the musical embodiment of that double-life dichotomy.Throughout the 1960s, the Canadian composer was as ubiquitous on children’s and variety shows as were exotic animals from the San Diego Zoo. But he wasn’t there to perform so much as demonstrate. Back then, electronic music wasn’t a genre; it was a scientific discipline, and Haack was among its most fervent early adopters. In his formative compositions for theatre and ballet, he had experimented with tape loops and musique concrète techniques; by the early ’60s, he wasn’t just playing around with electronic sounds, but also making the very gizmos that generated them.As a guest on Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, Haack wowed kids with his Musical Computer—a homemade contraption built from a suitcase and cutlery drawer that was part synthesizer, part Theremin, part Clapper. Another invention, dubbed the Dermatron—showcased on The Tonight Show and The Mike Douglas Show—was a heat-sensitive synthesizer pad strapped onto a willing subject’s face. The novelty of these innovations coincided nicely with a ’60s-era appetite for space-age futurism, and, by day, Haack would eke out a living as a composer for commercials and a series of instructive, interactive children’s records made with collaborator Esther Nelson. But by night, Haack was making music that was decidedly adults-only.Originally released in 1970, The Electric Lucifer was Haack’s first work pitched to a contemporary rock audience, released by Columbia Records in the dying days of a post-hippie moment when bizarro outsider-psych could still find a home on a major label. If it was not the first rock record to feature electronics, it was certainly among the first to give them a starring role—both musically and conceptually. For Haack, the advent of computerized technology represented not just a cool innovation; it was a turning point in the evolution of the human race, investing us mere mortals with the power to play God. And so The Electric Lucifer was envisioned as an ominous concept album consumed with religiosity and apocalypse, where the fate of humanity is determined by an epic battle between good and evil, love and hate, Mother Earth and modernity. It’s like a Henry Darger painting rendered in pixels.Not surprisingly, this exceedingly strange record flopped upon release. But its commercial failure didn’t deter Haack from further exploration of the dark arts. While he continued to crank out children’s records through the ’70s, he also made increasingly primitive and profane exercises in avant-electronica—including an Electric Lucifer sequel and the infamous Haackula—that would go unreleased for decades. And in the years leading up to his death from heart failure in 1988, Haack’s outré experiments had begun to dovetail with the contemporaneous rise of hip-hop and electro, resulting in an oddball collaboration with future Def Jam don Russell Simmons on the 1982 single “Party Machine.” Since then, Haack's quirky kids’ records have curried enough favor with crate-diggers to spawn an all-star tribute record, while his post-1970 catalog has been subject to a Stones Throw overview. But this reissue of The Electric Lucifer (via Toronto art-punk label Telephone Explosion) presents us with an opportunity to experience Haack’s most accomplished work in all its paranoia-stricken, end-times glory.As much as The Electric Lucifer was ahead of its time, the album was also very much a product of it. You get a pretty good sense of the kind of rock music that Haack was drawn to, namely the organ-powered poetry of the Doors and the Dada-esque mayhem of the Mothers of Invention. To modern ears, parts of the record may initially scan as downright goofy—the opening “Electric to Me Turn” sounds like nothing so much an android hockey-arena organist going on the fritz. But even that silly introduction betrays what makes the album unique.Much early electronic pop music—from “Telstar” all the way to Kraftwerk—projected a utopian quality that announced itself as the sound of the future, with clean, bright synth tones prepping us for the oncoming age of flying cars and interplanetary travel. But on The Electric Lucifer, Haack uses his hardware to foretell our demise. This is a thoroughly unsettled record, full of fidgety bleeps and bloops that envision a world choking on wires; vocoderized voices devoid of emotion; and sudden structural shifts that feel like the Earth’s crust being split open. On the sound-collage splatter of “War,” Haack subjects baroque-classical and marching-band melodies to synth-blasted shock treatment; they emerge distorted and decayed, faded remnants of our society for aliens to discover thousands of years from now. The Electric Lucifer is split evenly between these sort of free-form interludes and proper songs, and the record actually gets stranger the more it leans on the latter. Haack enlisted a revolving cast of guest singers—including friend-turned-manager Chris Kachulis—to serve as The Electric Lucifer’s de facto narrators, investing expository tracks like “Cherubic Hymn” with a melodramatic gusto worthy of the Gilligan’s Island theme. (They’re also prone to disturbing spoken-word outbursts that channel Jim Morrison at his “Soft Parade” batshit craziest.) Where that song revels in the jarring contrast between its valorous vocal delivery and short-circuiting sound design, The Electric Lucifer’s man\\/machine dialectic manifests itself in more insidious ways. “Song of the Death Machine” is a seemingly innocent sing-along modeled after “You Are My Sunshine,” before it’s slowly debased by disintegrating sonics and Haack’s unnervingly demonic vocal. And while “Word Game” at first sounds like a throwaway, free-associative exercise in proto-fridge-magnet-poetry, things take a turn for the sinister when Haack’s cold, roboticized voice starts lingering on the eerie confluences and contradictions that exist in our everyday vocabulary: “Death\\/Breath\\/Earth\\/Birth\\/Life\\/L-I-V-E\\/Live\\/E-V-I-L\\/Evil\\/Lived\\/L-I-V-E-D\\/D-E-V-I-L\\/Devil\\/Divine…”The Electric Lucifer climaxes with the foreboding majesty of “Super Nova,” whose intensifying oscillations and creepy, whispered incantations point the way to krautrock and the cryogenic chill of Suicide. But The Electric Lucifer’s great prophecies were as much philosophical as musical. On “Program Me,” Haack fashions a gospel spiritual for the dawn of the digital age: “My heart beats\\/Electrically\\/My brain computes\\/Program me!” With its subliminal synthetic-drum loop and urgent bass pulse, “Program Me” is one of the rare moments on The Electric Lucifer where the rhythm builds into a hypnotic groove. But Haack’s technophilia didn’t so much anticipate the rise of EDM as a modern world where computers can write Beatles songs and God has been forsaken for gadgets.\"],[22314,\"When the feminist artist Judy Chicago showed her painting Red Flag in 1971, she set the precedent for a subject of art that now has a rich lineage: menstrual blood. Red Flag was a photolithograph that closely depicted a woman removing a used tampon from her vagina. At the time, moon-cycles were so hushed and taboo that Chicago said many people had no idea what they were seeing. Period art has since taken many forms. The disarray of Tracey Emin’s 1998 “My Bed” installation included stained underwear. The 13 abstract canvases of Lani Beloso’s 2010 “Period Piece” were thickly painted with her own blood. And let us not forget, more recently, the punk singer Meredith Graves mixing her blood into the vinyl of Perfect Pussy’s debut record. In 2000, the artist Vanessa Tiegs coined a term for this field: menstrala.There is a long history of abject art that makes use of corporeal waste. Julia Kristeva articulated this in her book Powers of Horror: “These body fluids, this defilement, this shit are what life withstands... on the part of death,” Kristeva wrote. “There, I am at the border of my condition as a living being.” But period blood is different. According to Kristeva, it “threatens the relationship between the sexes” because it “signifies sexual difference.” And so, in threatening men, the stigmas surrounding menstrala have not waned. This year, the artist Rupi Kaur posted on Instagram a poised self-portrait with a central red stain—and it was twice removed, “accidentally.”The Norwegian avant-gardist Jenny Hval takes on the possibilities of musical menstrala with Blood Bitch. In an artist’s statement, she called Blood Bitch “an investigation of... blood that is shed naturally... the purest and most powerful, yet most trivial, and most terrifying blood.” With that, Blood Bitch, her sixth album, deliberately enters two other great traditions: vampire movies and—as with all of Hval’s work—the timeless cross-hairs of art and pop.No contemporary artist sings words like “sublimation,” “clitoris,” or “soft dick rock” with such enveloping elegance or unfettered ease. On Blood Bitch, Hval continues with her subtle deliveries of “abstract romanticism,” “subjectivity,” and “speculum.” Her voice is at once extremely musical and coolly flat; occasionally, she whispers. On “The Great Undressing,” even as Hval makes a cogent metaphor between capitalism and unrequited love (“it never rests”), the yearning in her voice recalls Lana Del Rey. (In 2015, at least once, Hval’s touring troupe of singers, dancers, and performance artists did an unusual cover of “Summertime Sadness” that I will not forget.) Hval’s “Period Piece” weaves melodies like gorgeous latticework as she describes a sterile scene in a gynecologist’s office but turns it into her own personally transcendent experience. “Don’t be afraid,” she beckons, “it’s only blood.”Collaborating again with noise producer Lasse Marhaug, as on 2015’s Apocalypse, girl, Hval was drawn to reflect on her roots in Norwegian metal (in interviews, the duo have even noted ties between Darkthrone’s black metal classic “Transilvanian Hunger” and Blood Bitch’s lush, rolling penultimate track, “Secret Touch”). Though there are patches of harsh noise to be found, Blood Bitch parallels black metal more by its atmospheric nature, how it feels as though the record is thematically all-gravity and yet physically floating. The arrangements employ repetition, with recurring motifs and menacing synths that move in concentric circles. A subtle siren blare anchors “Female Vampire” and carries over “In the Red,” replete with the sound of incessant panting, as if someone is running in fear. On the former, Hval sings directly of “a strange slow rhythm, not exactly creating a rhythm, in and out of focus, vulnerable,” underscoring the nonlinear textures of Blood Bitch’s sound. At its most featherlight, Hval’s music is still positively saturated with ideas, all pulp, marrow, and (indeed) blood.Combined with copious interstitials and its horror premise, Blood Bitch is Hval’s most filmic album (which is saying something considering Apocalypse, girl listed characters from Bergman’s Persona in the credits) as well as her most conceptual and surreal work. It’s also slyly hilarious, adding levity to her repertoire. “The Great Undressing” starts with a meta piece in which Hval’s bandmates discuss the record itself—a classic expository scene. (Zia Anger: “What’s this album about, Jenny?” Annie Bielski: “It’s about vampires.” Anger: “No!” Bielski: “Yeah... Well, it’s about more things than that...”) Hval evokes true modern horrors, not just fantastical ones. On “Ritual Awakening,” she sings, “I clutch my phone with my sweaty palm,” soon flipping the object as “the coffin for my heart... It’s so loud\\/And I get so afraid.” Machines lock us. Whether it’s Anger deeming vampires “so basic!” or Hval singing of “useless algorithms,” Blood Bitch sounds fiercely present.Blood Bitch is also more a montage than any of Hval’s records. “Untamed Region” includes a sample of the British filmmaker Adam Curtis describing the disorienting power-trip of Russian politics: “It sums up the strange mood of our time,” Curtis says alongside choral sighs, “where nothing makes any coherent sense.” “Untamed Region” moves into a stately passage in which Hval vulnerably and assuredly dissects her own period, touching the blood. More extreme is “The Plague,” which goes from tabla taps to a distressed, vampiric Hval summoning skyward, “I don't know who I am!” It’s all cut with horror organs and absurdist dialogue (“Last night I took my birth control with rosé!”) before ghastly noise bleeds into a faint dancefloor banger. “The Plague” is like a repository of ideas, as if precisely documenting an active mind.“Conceptual Romance” is Hval’s best and loveliest song, and its genesis point is clear. Hval has often cited Chris Kraus’ 1997 theoretical novel I Love Dick as her favorite book. The text celebrates the interior intellectual life of its narrator, a failed experimental filmmaker, in the context of a peculiar love story—she’s become obsessed with a man named Dick and she writes letters to him. It began one night, when she believed she had “conceptually fucked” him (through conversation). She turns her fixed “infatuation” into an art project. When Hval sings of her “combined failures,” when she sings “I understand infatuation\\/Rejection\\/They can connect and become everything\\/Everything that’s torn up in your life,” it’s like she is writing her own love letter right back to Kraus (which Hval herself affirmed in a recent Wire feature). Hval said she was inspired by karaoke on Apocalypse, girl, and “Conceptual Romance” could be a result. Her most lucid writing casts the spell of dream logic. “Conceptual Romance” is Blood Bitch’s lightening bolt moment, but it throbs with grace, like a procession of clouds.“Why do people still not get it when we [women] handle vulnerability like philosophy, at some remove?” Kraus writes in I Love Dick. It’s a fine summation of Hval’s music. More than any of the musicians to whom she is often compared (Laurie Anderson, Björk), Hval is a clear disciple of Kraus. On paper, Kraus moves fluidly from reference to reference, dense with ideas; Hval’s music is like this, too, and never more than on Blood Bitch. Like I Love Dick—which tends to draw lines, life before reading, life after—it is primarily about female genius and voice. “I need to keep writing because everything else is death,” Hval sings on “The Great Undressing,” “I’m self-sufficient, mad, endlessly producing.” Blood Bitch conveys the visceral euphoria of creation. Blood, it reminds us, is not only a life force—it’s where we begin.\"],[22362,\"The fiery, pastoral steel-string guitar music of Jack Rose first entered the national consciousness in the mid 2000s, as part of a return-to-roots movement sometimes called “New Weird America.” If you were to ask Rose, however, he’d have likely told you there wasn’t much “new” about what he was doing. Rose’s inspiration came largely from pre-war American music: country blues, ragtime, and jazz. But his work never took on the tone of an archivist or academic: his guitar playing always sounded alive and in the moment. In his self-penned liner notes for his sophomore album, Opium Musick, Rose poked fun at himself. Writing under an acronymic pen name and paying homage to the tradition of steel-string albums with satirically self-important liner notes (see John Fahey and Leo Kottke), Rose invented an origin story in which an aged sensae urged him “not to let the ragtime die and to bring it into the 21st century.” Even early in his career, Rose was self-aware in his self-mythologizing, illustrating both a strong sense of humor and a defiant sense of purpose.  “A lot of people, when they view old-time music, they view it as gentle or nostalgic, which I don’t get at all,” Rose said around the release of Golden Apples of the Sun, a scene-establishing compilation for the “New Weird”\\/freak-folk moment, on which he was included among acts like Antony and the Johnsons, Joanna Newsom, and Vashti Bunyan. “It was totally bizarre sounding to me, and messed up,” he added. Throughout his too-short career and across his nine excellent solo albums, the Virginia-born, Philadelphia-based guitarist made a living out of bizarre sounding, messed-up, old-time music. Six of his albums have been reissued on vinyl by the VHF and Three Lobed labels, and they are each eye-opening testaments to his gift. Collecting his earliest recordings as a solo guitarist through some of his final collaborations before his tragic death in 2009 at the age of 39, these records illustrate Rose’s artistic mastery and his influence on the future of the genre.On his 2002 debut, Red Horse, White Mule, the self-taught Rose already harbored an acute awareness of the possibilities of his instrument. In the opening “Red Horse,” he plays with a sprawling musicality and insistent rhythm, thumbing a steady picking pattern that picks up in intensity and speed as the track goes on. By the next song, a cover of Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground,” he’s using his slide to create an eerie buzz, calling back to his heavy, droning work with the improv group Pelt in the ’90s and forecasting the wilder compositions to come. Red Horse is a distinctive, if nascent, work—the sound an artist falling in love with his instrument and attempting to put all he knows on tape. Even just one album in, Rose had already created a signature sound and style, and there was a ghostly presence lurking throughout.John Fahey’s solo guitar compositions cast a heavy shadow on anyone approaching the steel string guitar in a solo context. But, of all the guitar soli artists to emerge over the last two decades, Jack Rose is the one who followed most closely in Fahey’s footsteps. Like Fahey, Rose’s thoroughly researched and lived-in Americana hinted at a deep understanding of the nation’s history. Even his more psychedelic moments unfolded with a penchant for stark realism. His music was beautiful and familiar, without ever feeling predictable or cliched. The sonic similarities between the two guitarists can be effectively boiled down to a melodic sensibility that Glenn Jones called, in the excellent live DVD The Things That We Used to Do, a “resolutely anti-sentimental approach” (Rose puts it more bluntly: he doesn’t play any “pussy chords”). Rose’s music was a distinct turn away from the acoustic guitar’s more romantic qualities. It makes sense that he was ideologically opposed to the New Age-leaning acts like William Ackerman on the Windham Hill label and the more melodic recordings of Kottke.As he developed as a guitarist, Rose would carve out his own niche. If Red Horse illustrated the myriad possibilities of his instrument, then its follow-up, Opium Musick, was a more intricate portrait of the artist behind the music. In the time between Red Horse and Opium Musick, Rose’s obsession with ragtime intensified, lending him a brighter and more dynamic picking style. The album also marks the moment when Rose’s interest in Indian sitar music and ragas blossomed, particularly with on the opening “Yaman Blues,” which features tanpura played by Pelt’s Mike Gangloff. “Linden Avenue Stomp” is another collaborative track, this time with Glenn Jones. Aside from becoming one of many new folk standards in Rose’s catalog, it is also the most Fahey-influenced track on the album, not to mention, one named for the house where Fahey cut most of his records (The title, however, marks another apocryphal moment in folk music: the street was actually called Linhurst Ave, but the duo thought “Linden” sounded more poetic).Raag Manifestos from 2004 was an even more ambitious collection than its predecessor, a diverse and comprehensive record that transcends its odds-and-ends structure. Originally released as a tour-only CD-R, compiling material from various singles and compilations, Manifestos is a sprawling work that feels like a summary of Rose’s discography to that point. Across its seven tracks, Rose plays both steel and 12-string guitar with a newfound confidence, from the intense, lo-fi rumblings of “Hart Crane’s Old Boyfriends” and “Black Pearls From the River” (a composition also recorded by Pelt) to the quiet, bucolic fingerpicking in “Road.” Manifestos was a breakthrough for Rose, but it was also the jumping-off point that led to his greatest work.The following year saw the release of Kensington Blues, an album that remains Rose’s most essential release and the one that defines his career to this day (although it is not included in either of these reissues). Rose himself referred to Kensington as a “really hard record to live up to,” while also speaking of the pleasure he took in hearing other guitarists cover its songs, hinting at the communal drive that fueled Rose’s later recordings. Jack Rose, the 2006 follow-up to Kensington Blues, marks another attempt on his part to make a deeper connection. Its songs are shorter and more melodic. Tracks like “St. Louis Blues” and “Miss May’s Place” are sprightly and sweet, even catchy, and the album’s most sprawling composition, the stunning “Spirits in the House,” is less meandering than Rose’s previous epics. “When I’m working on my solo material I obsess over every little detail,” Rose told an interview in 2009, “It basically takes over my life.” “Spirits in the House” is a composition that displays Rose’s obsessive tendencies; it is his single most gorgeous recording, and a marker of how far he had come since his debut.The latter two releases in the reissue series—the live album I Do Play Rock and Roll and the collaborative Dr. Ragtime and His Pals, both released in 2008—each reveal completely different sides of Rose. Rock and Roll is one of his true masterpieces, but it could not have come from more humble beginnings. Culled from Rose’s archive of live recordings, after he agreed (while hungover) to release a new record, Rock and Roll actually offers Rose’s most adventurous compositions and highlights the wide potential he had left to explore. “Calais to Dover,” which appeared in a slightly condensed version on Kensington Blues, opens the album with a stately precision. Meanwhile, the closing “Sundogs” presents Rose as something of a provocateur—grinding his slide against the fretboard to create an incessant, noisy drone. The nearly half-hour track is an unabridged recording of a performance in Kutztown, Penn., that reportedly left his audience speechless. With the brief but gorgeous “Cathedral et Chartres” sandwiched between the two tracks, Rock and Roll could run at the risk of sounding tossed-off, but it makes for a visceral listen. For many fans, it is the quintessential Rose album: gorgeous, inspired, and deeply confrontational.Comparatively, Dr. Ragtime and His Pals is simply a good time. Make no mistake, even though Jack Rose’s records can be cerebral and intimate, they are by no means insular affairs: there is palpable joy in his looser numbers, and a gripping physicality to his heavier work. Throughout Rose's records, you hear him huff and hum behind his guitar, further blurring the line between studio and live recordings. Even so, with its euphoric reimagining of Rose’s key tracks, Dr. Ragtime is the most human record he ever released. It finds Rose surrounded by an army of collaborators, from long-time friend and influence Glenn Jones to up-and-coming banjo player Nathan Bowles (who carries Rose’s torch to this day, particularly on the excellent Whole & Cloven). Regarding the following year’s similarly collaborative Jack Rose & The Black Twig Pickers LP, Rose gushed that he was finally “playing the music [he] loved as a kid,” and you hear that excitement throughout this record.While his album with the Black Twig Pickers further developed Rose’s skill as a collaborator and his final release, 2010’s Luck in the Valley, took Rock and Roll’s intimate compositions to even headier territory, his 2008 releases serve as a fitting summation of Rose’s career. They represent an artist deeply committed to his craft and embedded within a community that still bears his mark today, making his influence more visible than ever. In conversation with Glenn Jones in 2008, Rose spoke fondly of his friend’s music, complementing Jones’ strength as a storyteller and his scope as a composer. He speaks particularly highly of one song from Jones’ debut album, though he couldn't remember its name (the song, as it turns out, was named for Rose). Ever averse to sentimentality, Jack Rose made records that showcased Americana as something to be explored and the blues as something to be lived, creating a vital body of work that will likely be rediscovered and fallen in love with the more time passes.\"],[22435,\"In 2010, São Paulo’s Luísa Maita released her debut album Lero-Lero and entered into the family business. Her mother, Myriam Taubkin, was a concert producer while her father, Amado Maita, released what’s now considered a holy grail album back in 1972. Lero-Lero continued in her father’s tradition with an album full of hushed acoustic sambas, which she later opened up to DJ reinterpretation from Fatboy Slim-approved producer Tejo to DJ\\/rupture. A follow-up was not soon forthcoming, not that Maita vanished from the spotlight completely. She covered Caetano Veloso and Elis Regina for a few tributes, lent vocals to fellow “samba sujo” singer Rodrigo Campos’s debut album, and two of her songs from Lero-Lero were featured on the soundtrack to Richard Linklater’s Boyhood. Her voice could also be heard both during the closing ceremonies of the London Olympics and on promos for the recent Rio Olympics.Coming six years after Maita’s debut, Fio da Memória proves that the wait wasn’t in vain. Rather than delve deeper into samba and bossa nova classicism and let others update it with remixes, Maita and cohorts modernize the deep history of the music themselves. The result is a striking album full of spare but heavily percussive downtempo tracks that foreground the smokiness, subtlety, and empowerment in her voice. Maita’s Portuguese barely rises about a purr on opener “Na Asa,” but its message is clear. “If you want to be reborn\\/Your power is in your wings,” she sings against a backdrop of a martial snare, finger snaps, and a deep, spacey bass drum.For the most part, the drum programming, track-filtering, and sampler duties fall to producers Tejo and Zé Nigro. But while electronics propel most of the tracks, both are tasteful to never let it overwhelm the band itself, providing another rhythmic tick to the uptempo rumble of “Porão” and adding psychedelic trickles to the title track. Tejo gives a ’90s trip-hop thump to “Volta,” while a distant samba drum line gets tweaked and teased by Nigro into many layers for “Folia.”But Maita and her band are more than capable of conjuring a smoldering atmosphere on their own with live instrumentation, too. “Olé” seethes with stitches of guitar, bass, and cowbell, then flares to full fire as Maita whispers about finding liberation from an old love and freedom to love again: “I will stand up for myself…and I will find what is mine.”Maita’s freedom from both her love of the past and the samba tradition is delectable. The underlying drum pattern on “Fio da Memória” is a samba, but Maita and her collaborators blur it in digital delay, synth fuzz, and processed drum hits, transforming that telltale pulse into something unfamiliar. “I wanted to revisit the Brazilian rhythms and other sounds that I have heard growing up from a contemporary, electronic and urban perspective,” she said in the lead-up to the album. Her mesmerizing voice playfully toys with such sentimentality: “Your story was stolen\\/By someone who loved you too deeply and also wept.” Rather than be heartbroken, she sounds gleeful to break from tradition.\"],[22373,\"A couple years ago, Belgium’s Oathbreaker were just another band that had some skill in merging shimmery melodies with blastbeats: an alluring and even comforting sound, if not the most original. In the three years between Eros|Anteros and their latest record, Rheia, they’ve expanded their scope without losing their rage. The album transforms their own abilities and the breadth of the much heralded—and derided—black metal-shoegaze fusion. Unlike many of their peers, Oathbreaker play with a hardcore directness, and even their more melodic moments draw more from post-hardcore than Britpop or shoegaze. “Second Son of R.” and “Being Able to Feel Nothing” in particular are two of the most furious tracks the band’s ever recorded, blazing through and never losing momentum even when the pace settles down. Comparisons to Deafheaven are inevitable (they were labelmates at one point), and they’re not always accurate, but there’s no denying that the surging breakdown towards the end of “Immortals” is modeled after “Luna.” Oathbreaker make it their own by suggesting an ultimate payoff, only to cut off before ultimate ecstasy. They’re vicious with their metal, albeit more discerning with how it’s dished out.Caro Tanghe’s vocals are where Oathbreaker really distinguish themselves, and it’s her awakening in particular where Rheia makes the biggest leap. She can scream her ass off, no question, but she’s able to lead the band by changing her tone. “Nothing” relies more on her choral sensibilities, which never make the rest of the band feel bloated or frilly. The acoustic refrain “Stay Here \\/ Accroche-Moi” sees her taking on a ghost-country approach: She slyly suggests pain that she’s more explicit about elsewhere. And even her screaming is varied—the end of “Second Son” is a constantly escalating hysteria, different from her more straightforward attack most of the time. By not defaulting on a raspy yell all the time, she fills in the band’s softer sections, which would be awkward with merely a hushed screech. “Needles in Your Skin” is Oathbreaker at their most dynamic, and makes for the album's centerpiece. It skews the “loud-soft” formula of post-black metal; Tanghe howling over clean guitar isn’t any less of a force than the full-on black metal blast that follows. In the middle, the band transitions to a hardcore chug, and layered under Tanghe’s hopeless mantra, “How could you go without me?” her desperation shines through. It’s simply devastating. Tanghe makes such a simple question, one we’ve all asked, harrowing in its relatable power. On Rheia’s second half, Oathbreaker break down structures even further, sometimes drifting away from metal altogether. “I’m Sorry, This Is” ushers in the shift, where the unease comes not from the guitar but from the wordless voices of Tanghe and added field recordings. It knocks “Where I Live” off its axis, making the raging black metal tempos that the album’s built on seem alien. “Begeerte” closes the record with airy vocals and submerged industrial drums, like Triptykon’s “My Pain” minus the goth-metal schmaltz. It’s an unsettling counterpart to intro “10:56,” which features Tanghe at her most soothing. “Begeerte” is different enough to where calling it and “10:56” bookends isn’t quite right. It’s more akin to returning to your hometown after a devastating disaster—or a devastating exposure to life outside it. Rheia never really returns home, and that’s the point. It’s meant to capture how our bodies fail us and the wandering nightmares that result with no neat resolution.While still fairly beholden to black metal, Rheia shares a core ideal with Cobalt’s Slow Forever and Deafheaven’s New Bermuda: They broke out of black metal’s stylistic confines, using it as a launching pad more than a set of totalitarian marching orders, and in the process became emotive, powerful metal albums. Without sacrificing extremity, they all captured the spirit of metal, not just the sound. It’s not that genre records don’t hold their own power; it’s that an album like Rheia can do so much more by crossing and uniting several paths.\"],[22447,\"The Cleveland-born and D.C.-based musician Aaron Abernathy is best known for his work as a session musician and the leader of Black Milk’s live band Nat Turner, the band that played behind Milk's recent jazz-rap album The Rebellion Sessions. Now standing center stage, Abernathy goes solo on his new LP aptly titled Monologue, which blends the weathered tropes of soul with his own formative life experiences. It’s a big, autobiographical conversation that also allows listeners to identify themselves in Ab’s life story.The album tells the true tale of Abernathy’s teenage summer love affair just before to his freshman year at Howard University. As with many first loves, it consumes everything in Ab’s life, which leads to the album’s most significant theme of isolation. Ab notes at the start of the album that he’s the “Son of Larry” and that his mother is his “Favorite Girl,” but, like many post-high school kids, he’s conflicted between his parents and his friends who he may never see again. Furthermore, he’s confronted with choosing between his old friends, his new girlfriend, and his piano lessons. As he sequesters himself over 11 tracks, he discovers another weathered soul trope: love, music, and expressing his appreciation of both in song creates the greatest strength and most significant creative power.The album’s DNA is largely comprised of three iconic moments in soul music. Just take the soaring guitar solo on Prince’s Sign ‘O’ the Times slow-jam “Adore,” the organic acoustic soul of early ’70s singer-songwriters like Donny Hathaway and Roberta Flack, and André 3000’s most earnest and lovelorn moments on his half Speakerboxxx\\/The Love Below, and the table is set. The lead single “I See You” handles the Prince component with an interplay between Abernathy’s own squawking falsetto, the chopped synths, and soaring lead guitar moments that rise from the mix. Abernathy himself notes that this song is supposed to create a sense of “crushing on someone.” However, there’s so much honest sensuality here that the song gently cascades over the edge into something much more erotic in nature.Phonte and Abernathy’s frequent collaborator Black Milk appear on “Bachelorette,” which alongside “I See You” perfectly articulate the quasi-romantic victory of wooing a girl into your father’s car to drive her home from the mall. That it takes roughly nine minutes and 30 seconds is maybe a bit problematic. On The Love Below, André 3000 does what Abernathy attempts in roughly half the time with “Spread,” and the “Where Are My Panties?” skit, which unlike Abernathy’s album, adds some humor to balance the serious sexuality. Abernathy mimicking Andre’s ability to know exactly at which heartstring to aim his stylings is impressive, but he hasn’t quite figured out the right tone or pacing. The moment that best encapsulates the album’s emotional core lay within the acoustic guitars and thick organic drum breaks that drive “I Need to Know.” Abernathy lays his soul bare and the lyrics’ spiritual essence animate in your mind’s eye. There’s no synths, no Prince-fetishization, and no early 2000s neo-soul to be found. Rather, there’s just Ab delivering what teenage life at the confluence of heartbreak, depression, and a slight fear of the unknown feels like.On an album that oftentimes veers into overwrought sentimentality for the purposes of hammering home Abernathy’s desire to spiritually connect with the listener, “I Need to Know’” is brilliantly simple in composition. It leaves enough space for the listener to feel Abernathy’s questioning delivery of lyrics like, “Am I running a race that I can’t win?” Of late, from Miguel to Bryson Tiller, there have been many soul albums released that inspire love-making. In veering towards sex but staying well-rooted in the ultra-emotional moments of discovering love (or heartbreak, we never quite find out), Aaron Abernathy has grounded himself in a lane that feels familiar but still carries you to new places.\"],[22468,\"Danny Brown is an auteur. Hip-hop has a tradition of collaboration, but the Detroit rapper is a one-man show who, while he reps his own Bruiser Brigade and works frequently with a handful of producers, has a voice and vision completely his own. You can think of his progression over the last five years in filmic terms. If 2011’s XXX was the brilliant independent foreign film that was critically acclaimed and wildly successful and put him on the map, Old was the solid but safer domestic version, with higher production costs, a prettier cast, and many of the edges sanded off. Atrocity Exhibition, then, is the movie someone makes after they come back down to earth from making that tentpole project, a work predicated on the “one for me, one for them” mentality.Brown’s individual releases need to be understood as part of a whole, and in each of them, he has an obsession with form. On Old, he took a throwaway line about getting jumped on the way to the grocery store to buy Wonder Bread from XXX and built a whole song around the incident, and he snakes references to his older work throughout Atrocity Exhibition. Take the title of the first song, “Downward Spiral.” It’s a direct nod to XXX’s opening track, where Brown prominently (and memorably) rapped: “it’s the downward spiral, got me suicidal\\/But too scared to do it.” By reaching back five years, Brown makes Atrocity Exhibition a brick in a larger edifice, perhaps a bookend to an implied trilogy that starts with XXX and ends here.Structurally, Atrocity Exhibition finds Brown doubling down on familiar tropes from his last two records: once again he starts with a gripping opener, the mise-en-scène; following that are some shorter songs in rapid succession that do the dirty work of exposition; a back-half run that reckons with the hedonism that comes before it (that section here starts with the Kelela-anointed “From the Ground”); and then, finally, a stomach-churning closing track that is never triumphantly resolute but feels like an ending just the same.But the references extend well beyond Brown’s own work, and well beyond hip-hop. “Downward Spiral” is of course an oblique Nine Inch Nails nod, and Brown, who sampled This Heat and Hawkwind on the same song on XXX, drags Atrocity Exhibition through an industrial, electronic, post-punk sludge, borrowing a title from Joy Division while releasing the album on Warp. The bass on “Rolling Stone,” a duet with South African singer Petite Noir, is pure New Order. “Ain’t It Funny,” with its bold horns, recalls the Stooges’ flirtations with free jazz and Bauhaus at their most bombastic.The thirty-five-year-old Brown has an old-head mentality as a rapper: play a song and he’ll rap on it. Make any beat and he’ll rap on it. It’s about rhymes, wordplay, and (for lack of a better term), bars. This approach isn’t currently fashionable, but there’s a pleasure in hearing someone else’s joy at putting words together—Brown’s old-school bent intermittently hits some delirious highs, from “Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce\\/Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis,” to “Rocks about the size as the teeth in Chris Rock’s mouth.”The potential pitfall to this word-drunk approach is sometimes his songs just aren’t easy on the ears. The production here sounds wonderful—frequent collaborator Paul White is credited with 10 songs, and the two have an easy chemistry, because both indulge in coloring outside traditional genre lines (White’s collaborative album with Open Mike Eagle from earlier this year, Hella Personal Film Festival, is kind of like the quieter, gentler, non-evil version of this album, pulling from a different set of rock influences). But Brown sometimes lapses into his Old flows, that idiosyncratic style where he falls off beat, gets in front of it, or simply yells above it. He avoids the frat-baiting EDM songs like “Dip” and “Smokin & Drinkin” that pocked Old here, even though singles like “When It Rain” (more vintage Brown than anything from the past five years) and “Pneumonia” flirt with that sound. But fortunately they’re too rough around the edges, too jumpy, too dark to soundtrack a scene like this. To its credit, Atrocity Exhibition balances its sonic elements and never slips into the mush of guitars and bad ideas that threatened to infiltrate rap at the dawn of this century. White, Brown’s most gifted and consistent collaborator, keeps things at an even keel.No matter what's going on with the music, Brown’s acute emotional writing is once again on full display. Where XXX seemed to promise a way out, Old reflected (and sometimes reveled in) the lifestyle afforded him through his breakout success. This record, as dark, dingy, and uncomfortable as it is, continues to suggest something deeper is haunting Brown. “Everybody say, you got a lot to be proud of\\/Been high this whole time, don’t realize what I done\\/‘Cause when I’m all alone, feels like no one care\\/Isolate myself and don’t go nowhere,” he offers. He so internalizes all of his demons that, for the third record in this implied trilogy, you start to worry—is he irredeemably lost? Is his pain a response to his upbringing in Detroit, ground zero for armchair sociologists looking for a symbol of American decay? How long before the dam finally breaks? The great “Lost” here brings all these concerns to a head. And then there’s “Really Doe,” produced by Detroit compatriot Black Milk, which juts out on the geography of the album because it features guest rappers (B-Real merely shows up for the hook on “Get Hi”) and also because it’s the only song not directly about Brown’s demons. It’s a fun track, and Earl Sweatshirt does that thing where he acts like he’s not rapping but ends up murdering everyone anyway while expending as little energy as possible. “I was a liar as a kid, so now I’m honest as fuck,” Earl offers, his unwavering delivery always imbuing what he raps with a startling amount of intimacy. You sometimes wish Brown could hit these more casually real notes more frequently, like he did on the origin story “EWNESW” from XXX or the blackout bars of “Greatest Rapper Ever” and “White Stripes” from 2010’s The Hybrid. But Brown is too good a writer and too focused on the whole not to carry heavy feelings into all his songs, like “some people say I think too much\\/I don’t think they think enough,” from “Rolling Stone,” and “your work killing fiends\\/‘cause you cut it with Fentanyl,” from “Ain’t It Funny.”  These reflective lines are the work of a smart writer with an eye for hard-earned detail, and Atrocity Exhibition finds Brown back behind the lens, capturing raw emotion with grainy 16mm.\"],[22446,\"A name like Innanet James gives a lot away. The Maryland rapper is a byproduct of the rap web, a post-regional stylist who built his base almost entirely online. He owes much of his success to a single email sent to Pigeons and Planes, which led to his breakout single, “Black,” going viral across the blogosphere. He owes his entire career to Lil Wayne, whose online mixtape Da Drought 3 inspired him to rap. As he was building his web presence in the early ’10s, he remained active locally. Under his first moniker Sails Martin, he caught an early break and became a member of GoldLink’s Squaaash Club. But when that relationship deteriorated, he rebooted, deleting all of his early music from the internet and becoming Innanet.  His debut EP, Quebec Place, named for a residential street in D.C., cashes in on the cachet he’s earned online. It’s a well-curated selection of electro soul cuts that borrow sounds from across regions to tell stories about home. He raps about paying his mama’s bills, feeling safe at his granny’s house, and treating Montgomery County like the sandbox adventure game Saints Row.  On “Jams,” he recounts being a small-time local artist, rapping, “Lost a couple friends, I ain’t McConaughey, I ain’t trip\\/Well I did, on the beat to tell them they ain’t shit\\/Sike nah, I’m in Maryland ‘cause really I ain’t rich\\/Where you learn real quick how real it can still get.” Things happen quickly in his raps and ideas are constantly overlapping. Nuggets about his Maryland upbringing are hidden in generalities. Despite being influenced by a wide range of artists, among them Wayne and Cam’ron, Quebec Place is still heavily indebted to what's happening locally in the DMV—Wale, GoldLink, and go-go—which is especially evident in the cadences on “Frequency” and the bounce on “Flavour.” He distills the scene into a bubbly brew while sampling sounds from outside sources. There are traces of Ghostface in James’ writing and on “Black” his inflections mimic Vince Staples, but he isn't defined by any of his influences. His phrasing is distinct and his wordplay is incredibly elastic, perfect for his free-associative raps. On tracks like “622” and “Summer,” thoughts unfurl in snippets. His verses split and break in weird places, and he’ll randomly lean in on an off-beat, creating space that he then slingshots through to reestablish his rhythm. He has an innate sense of time and tempo, and he has strong pop rap instincts, too.Quebec Place is a sampler of Innanet James’ unique talents, and he begins to find his footing on songs like “Jam,” where he goes toe-to-toe with DMV rapper Chaz French, both building off each other’s energy. “Girls” is a cross between Jay Z’s “Girls, Girls, Girls” and Ludacris’ “Pimpin’ All Over the World,” a cross-country roll call of his flings. He’s constantly taking cues from those before him and those around him all while becoming more comfortable in his own skin with each breath. On some tracks, he bursts through with reckless flows dictating the pace (“Frequency”); on others, he settles in, carefully stretches each syllable, packing them into open spaces (“622”). The EP builds to its closer, “Paint,” which takes a smooth soul sample and flips it into something sleek and modern, as James bounds into walls of rubbery synths. In its lyrics, he surveys his past and future, hoping to one day become a beacon of the community that made him. Quebec Place, which outlines his humble beginnings, is another good start.\"],[22299,\"Composer Darcy James Argue has often found joy in quixotic ideas. Starting a big band, more than half a century after they fell from popularity, is clearly one. Giving that group the name Secret Society and titling an early collection of compositions Infernal Machines only added more attitude to the enterprise. His pluck aside, Argue’s calling card thus far has been an ability to combine his love of jazz’s past with more contemporary sonics like indie-influenced electric guitar and bass, as well as arrangement tricks culled from his study of classical music. He’s clever without being arch, a syncretic creator who avoids obvious imitation.Real Enemies is his most varied album yet, and his most thematically ambitious. Because it was originally conceived as a multimedia stage show for the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave Festival, it has both the length of a play as well as a dramatic conceit, as it promises an exploration of “the paranoid style in American politics.” (That famous 1964 essay by Richard Hofstadter is quoted, in a slightly adapted form, toward the end of Real Enemies, in a narration by actor James Urbaniak.)This is a savvy choice of topic, and not just because of our era of “post-truth politics,” or due to the range of conspiracy theories that have found purchase among different voting coalitions. The central masterstroke of Real Enemies is its realization that instrumental music can prove a useful forum in which to explore the shadowy manipulations of propaganda and state secrecy. The overtly American sound of a big band—particularly one updated with aspects of other modern song styles—becomes an ideal way to channel both vintage Cold War scaremongering and contemporary unease over cell-phone data harvesting. In this way, Real Enemies often shows how moods can wield more influence than words (or logic).Argue and his band leave few conspiratorial airs unexploited in this giddy, often explosive 78-minute suite. There are discordant touches of noir (inspired by scores of politically cynical ’70s films like The Parallax View), as well as minor-key warnings that reference Philip Glass’ writing for the Errol Morris documentary The Fog of War. And there’s plenty of music that feels original to this idiosyncratic composer and his well-drilled ensemble.Coming after a quiet, unsettling introduction, and a strutting follow-up track that suggests a detective pursuing a case, “Dark Alliance” is the album’s first mind-blower. In this brilliant piece of hybridism, Argue creates an opening groove from a vintage-sounding synth line and rhythm guitar funk strumming, both of which call to mind early-’80s rap. (A clip of Nancy Reagan’s anodyne anti-drug speechifying—“say yes to your life”—confirms the era under review.) Then there is a shift to Latin jazz: specifically, an adaptation of composer Luis Enrique Mejía Godoy’s “Un Son Para Mi Pueblo,” an anthem written in celebration of the Nicaraguan Revolution. Argue’s pivot here isn’t random—instead, it’s a narrative choice that points to the contradiction between the Reagan administration’s domestic “war on drugs” and its simultaneous eagerness to undermine the Nicaraguan Revolution by working with the Contras. A government review later conceded that the CIA turned a blind eye to cocaine trafficking by its allies during this particular foreign policy episode. (And the title of the song is a reference to a controversial series of articles that first raised this issue.) The slickness of all this commentary wouldn’t be half as powerful if the musical execution was less than stellar, but the Secret Society displays their startling virtuosity in these genre shifts.Elsewhere, Sebastian Noelle delivers an electric guitar feature full of spindly menace during the medium-tempo introduction of “Trust No One,” just before a clip of onetime Senator Frank Church discussing the ill effects of CIA narratives planted in foreign media. Once the government audio-drop is over, the full band digs into some powerful ensemble writing by Argue, while Carl Maraghi’s bluesy baritone sax solo carries an even greater sense of alarm. In “Best Friends Forever”—a piece about the military industrial complex—the martial, Glass-style triads lead to an alto sax solo from Rob Wilkerson that at first seems darkly resigned, until Argue’s introduction of a bass-drum thump prompts lines that sound more like combat heralds.Argue mixes references to conspiracies that actually happened with glimpses of infamous false rumors (like the “birther” controversy directed at President Obama). On “Casus Belli,” Argue composes swinging music as a comic counterpoint to some of former Vice President Dick Cheney’s grimmer assertions. If the pairing of text and score sometimes seems a bit flip, it’s useful to recall that matters of grave political importance don’t always inspire the seriousness that they deserve from the public, either.Despite all these references, the album’s goal isn’t to be any sort of history lesson. Instead, it’s a stylish evocation of the wild (and sometimes seductive) incoherence that flows from crises in which key evidence is either obscured or invented. Given this, Real Enemies feels, at its root, like a plea for greater civic trust and more rigorous thinking. For all its crazy quilt patterns and disparate musical inputs, there are telling hints of this suite’s carefully considered structure: The minimalist patterns of “Best Friends Forever” are echoed later, in “Apocalypse Is a Process,” while the synth from “Dark Alliance” is brought back during “Never a Straight Answer.”The album’s liner notes offer visual collages and context clues for each of the album’s 13 tracks, providing a hint of the original multimedia stage production. But the suite doesn’t really need them, as it’s sufficiently engrossing and cogent all by itself. You’d almost think it impossible for a big band album to do all this in 2016—but here’s all the evidence, right out in the open for you to inspect.\"],[22434,\"You’d be forgiven for thinking that, after a playful and prolific run through most of the 2000s, the peculiar electronic music producer Jan Jelinek had taken an extended break. Since 2006’s Tierbeobachtungen, there hasn’t been a full-length released under his name. There have been collaborations (though it would appear that his work with Gesellschaft Zur Emanzipation Des Samples is, like his Ursula Bogner releases, simply another iteration of Jelinek working under another name) as well as a series of wonderfully weird vinyl-only 12”s that collected radio pieces and art commissions. One release—in an act of surreal prescience four years before the fact—even opened with a sample from eventual Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.Throughout this time, Jelinek’s one constant has been an ongoing collaboration with Japanese vibraphonist Masayoshi Fujita. They released an album in 2010 and followed it up with a live EP in 2013. Now comes a second duo album, and the dialogue between the two is so sympathetic it's hard to tell just where Fujita’s prepared vibraphone ends and Jelinek’s whirring mechanisms and blipping loops begin. It’s a musical relationship that lends itself towards atmospheric explorations, the sounds taking on the hazy sheen of a particularly muggy afternoon. As Jelinek writes on the back cover of Schaum, he notes that the tendency of their work tends towards the tag of “tropical.” “I have long been obsessed with the tropics,” he writes. “This obsession involves a mental image of a specific quality of landscape: deliriously extravagant unstructuredness.”So the grayscale palm frond on the cover is fitting, though “extravagant” would be a deceptive way to describe these eight woozy, mainly unhurried pieces, but there is something deliciously irrational about all of them. Small, fluttering drones mix with swamp gas and what sounds like a clock being wound up on “Urub,” and “Helio” sounds like R2-D2 getting burped. The bubbling glitches and cricket sounds that open up “What You Should Know About Me” soon turn queasy and comical, a bicycle bell and thrummed piece of metal providing a rhythm not unlike a submerged bumper car thumping against a sea sponge. Or is that a gamelan bobbing against the sides of a bath tub?So gentle and breezy is Schaum that the density of sounds the two players actually stir up is easy to miss. “LesLang” and the aptly titled “Vague, Yet” could be a nature recording that’s gently processed into an ambient wash. But home in on the sounds that mimic chirping frogs and soon you’ll note that crickets and coos come into greater detail, as do all manner of squiggles, buzzes, plonks and squelches, to where your ears toggle between focus and fuzziness, just like listening in nature.On the exquisite nine-minutes close “Parades,” Jelinek’s observations and obsessions come true and the album transforms into an uncanny landscape worthy of Henri Rousseau, weirdly flat and deeply detailed all at once. Each piece of Schaum is open enough so that they can be perceived as formless or self-contained microcosms. It’s an album immersive enough to suggest dense foliage or a wavering landscape completely submerged underwater, depending on your idea of paradise.\"],[22292,\"The passage of time has done nothing to make the mid-’90s heyday of Guided by Voices seem any less extraordinary. Released at the height of the band’s underground popularity in 1995, Alien Lanes supposedly cost $10 to make (excluding the cost of the beer consumed as it was recorded) while garnering GBV an advance worth nearly $100,000 from its new record label, Matador. GBV’s 37-year-old mastermind and only permanent member, Robert Pollard, had already been around a while, recording several albums in the ’80s and early ’90s that virtually nobody heard. But Pollard’s latest opus was a big deal: famous mastering engineer Bob Ludwig mastered Alien Lanes. (Among Ludwig's prior credits was Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska, possibly the most celebrated \\\\\"lo-fi\\\\\" album ever.) Upon release, Alien Lanes was greeted with a laudatory four-star review in Rolling Stone comparing GBV to the twin pillars of ’90s alt-rock, R.E.M. and Nirvana. “The new drunk drivers\\/Have hoisted the flag,” Pollard sings on Alien Lanes’ opening track, “A Salty Salute.” The bravado was warranted. Bandcamp has since normalized the idea of a bedroom tunesmith from flyover country releasing a self-recorded masterpiece to the world, and getting semi-famous in the process. Will Toledo was once a high school kid from Virginia who wrote and recorded dozens of songs in the backseat of his parents’ car, and now Car Seat Headrest is one of 2016’s biggest new indie bands. But the lack of online distribution channels was hardly GBV’s only disadvantage before Alien Lanes. By the time GBV’s would-be swan song, 1992’s Propeller, became a surprise critical hit, Pollard was a family man from Dayton, Ohio, who by rock‘n’roll standards was over-the-hill. By day, he worked as an elementary schoolteacher, and on weekends, he blew off steam by getting drunk in his garage and laying down weird, succinct, and insanely catchy songs informed by ’60s and ’70s prog and psych-rock on a four-track machine with guys from the neighborhood. And for many years, that was basically the extent of Pollard’s music career. Even after GBV finally made its mark, Pollard’s unabashed devotion to the less fashionable sectors of classic rock (Peter Gabriel-era Genesis, Who’s Next, Cheap Trick) put him out-of-step with indie’s entrenched punk orthodoxy. “King Crimson with a short attention span and a sixpack,” was how Craig Marks described Guided by Voices in the Spin Alternative Record Guide, published just as the band’s notoriety was peaking. While the King Crimson comparison would’ve flattered Pollard, it wasn’t meant as a compliment in the alt-era. What Guided by Voices lacked in traditional indie cool, it made up for in songs. So many, many songs—great songs, bad songs, OK songs that became good because they were short and worked as segues between the great songs. With 28 tracks dispensed in just 41 minutes, Alien Lanes offered up more songs than any other GBV album, and they were dense with in-jokes and non-sequiturs about a pimple zoo, the Amazing Rockethead, and Baron Von Richtofen, among other obscurities. Pollard’s method was to write five duds in order to get one perfect tune, and then release all six songs. In the end, making art was like breathing for Pollard—you can’t inhale oxygen without exhaling carbon dioxide. GBV also had mystique to burn. After 1994’s Bee Thousand made them bona-fide indie sensations, music critics talked about the band in terms that recalled the romanticism once foisted on the Band, as it transitioned from Bob Dylan’s backing group to the rustic fantasia of 1968’s Music From Big Pink. Like the Band, GBV were perceived to be “proud brothers,” to quote “A Salty Salute”—regular, blue-collar guys who drank cheap domestic beer without irony and imbued prissy indie conventions with jocular earthiness and a refreshing lack of pretension. As far as New York City-based music writers were concerned, Dayton might as well have been situated in the middle of the woods, a la the Band’s mythical headquarters in West Saugerties. (In reality, Dayton was a good-sized Midwestern city with a population of about 175,000 in 1995.) But Pollard’s image as a hick-savant wasn’t entirely media-created—he played his own role in cultivating it. Consciously or not, Pollard integrated GBV’s “regular guy” image into the songs and iconography of Alien Lanes like never before. On the back cover there’s a photo of GBV’s ever-shifting lineup at the time of the album’s creation, seated on a couch in what appears to be a basement. Pollard is in the middle, staring upward and looking dapper in red, white, and blue Chuck Taylors. To Pollard’s right is guitarist Tobin Sprout, the George Harrison to Pollard’s Lennon\\/McCartney, and bassist James Greer, a Spin writer who profiled the band and then didn’t want to leave. (Greer exited the group soon after, though he later became GBV’s biographer. Greg Demos is commonly referred to as the “classic lineup” bassist, and he’s also listed in the liner notes.) To Pollard’s left is drummer Kevin Fennell, Pollard’s former brother-in-law, and lead guitarist Mitch Mitchell, a chain-smoking Keith Richards-type who first played with Pollard in a late-’70s metal band called Anacrusis. “When you saw them live, it was just so fucking powerful; it rocked so hard, it was physically powerful,” Matador co-owner Gerard Cosloy tells Greer in Guided by Voices: A Brief History. “I was expecting something way more low-key, like the records.” Alien Lanes seems like an attempt to rectify any “low-key” misconceptions, with songs like the caterwauling “Striped White Jets” and Who-like “My Son Cool” approximating the arena rock of Pollard’s youth. But while portions of Alien Lanes were recorded live, most of the tracks were assembled via Pollard’s usual recording methods. For the propulsive power-pop number “Game of Pricks”—which sounds like a bootleg of an imaginary, amphetamine-fueled Beatles gig from 1965—Pollard met with Fennell and Sprout in Fennell’s basement. After running the through the song a couple of times, Pollard laid down guitar and drum parts with Fennell, and then overdubbed bass and vocals. Sprout’s job was to operate the Tascam recorder—he turned the bass knobs all the way down and the treble all the way up, per Pollard’s request—and make sure the inexpensive Radio Shack microphones scattered about the room were turned on. Once Sprout performed a quick mix, “Game of Pricks” was finished in about 30 minutes. While he entertained an offer from Warner Bros. before opting to sign with Matador, Pollard wasn’t yet interested in making a slick, radio-friendly record. (That would happen later with 1999’s Do the Collapse, when it was probably too late for GBV to make any real commercial impact.) In A Brief History, Greer writes that Pollard expressed his desire for “a wall full of gold records” while meeting with Warner Bros. But Pollard was also insecure about the viability of his songs and paranoid about the record industry. He wanted a large audience, but GBV’s flash of indie-fame also made him squirm. “I couldn’t hide anymore,” Pollard told Marc Woodworth in 2006. “I was full of second guessing.”  “Echos Myron” sums up the jovial mood of Bee Thousand: “We’re finally here\\/And shit yeah, it’s cool!” But on Alien Lanes, the good vibes were replaced by nostalgia for lost innocence and crippling anxiety about what lies ahead. Dark warnings permeate the songs: “Don’t let anyone find out\\/Or expose your feelings” (“Striped White Jets”); “Try to be nice and look what it gets you” (“Closer You Are”); “Temptation creeps to you like rapists in the night” (“(I Wanna Be a) Dumbcharger”); “You could never be strong\\/You can only be free” (“Game of Pricks”). The most disturbing track on Alien Lanes is “Always Crush Me,” a nightmarishly mechanical piano ballad that reimagines Gilbert and Sullivan as a John Cale deep cut. “Always crush me\\/Picture my amazement\\/When it doesn’t always pain me\\/And I will reproduce faster,” Pollard yelps over clipped keyboard plunks, obliquely referencing GBV's newfound commercialism. Elsewhere on Alien Lanes, Pollard goes out of his way to deface his most beautiful songs, whether it’s overdubbing an obnoxious snoring sound on the sparkling “Ex-Supermodel” or warping the tempo, like a Walkman operating on dying batteries, on “Chicken Blows.” What was Pollard afraid of? Whatever the answer, Alien Lanes sold worse than Bee Thousand and was generally considered inferior. “I met Kim Deal when we did Bee Thousand. She really loved that record, but Alien Lanes she wasn’t crazy about,” Pollard told Mojo in 2002. “She thought it was too much, too bombastic, but that’s what I like about it.”“Pop for perverts,” was Robert Christgau’s assessment of GBV in 1994. The legendary Village Voice music critic dismissed them as “pomo smarty-pants too prudish and\\/or alienated to take their pleasure without a touch of pain to remind them that they're still alive.” I humbly submit that Christgau just didn’t understand the Midwest. Pollard’s genius was creating a band framework in which he could become anything he wanted—specifically, a hotshot 22-year-old British rock star from 1969—while remaining exactly who he was outside of it. Alien Lanes is the sound of a man reconciling his dreams (which had come true, more or less) with his reality (which had splintered, though he tried for a while to maintain his band and his marriage). The omnipresent hiss on Alien Lanes was necessary because it was Pollard’s way of signaling to the people back home that he wasn’t getting too full of himself, a reflexive impulse bred into every middle-American. The trebly bombast and pronounced discursiveness of Alien Lanes was read as typical indie caginess in 1995, but 21 years later, it’s this tension between Pollard’s big-time rock classicism and self-defeating sonic fuckery that’s aged best. In retrospect, Alien Lanes can be viewed as a nexus point in rock history, representing the end of an era when the record business believed that a band like this could make a million dollars, and the beginning of our current era in which rock is essentially folk music, where it’s kept alive not out of financial imperative, but because rock can act as a safe space for people who have consciously decided to ignore financial imperatives and exist outside of mainstream culture. In my view, Alien Lanes is the greatest post-modern classic rock album ever made, because it exemplifies the songwriting and posture of classic rock while also implicitly commenting on rock’s cultural decline. This was already underway in 1995, the year after Kurt Cobain died, when the top-selling rock artists were Hootie and the Blowfish, Alanis Morissette, and Live. It was this world that Guided by Voices was tasked with taking over, though when you listen to Alien Lanes, all you hear is Pollard’s ambivalence. In “Motor Away,” which lives at the heart of Alien Lanes both sequentially (it’s the 15th track) and spiritually, Pollard sings about the liberation of blasting down an open road in order to “belittle every little voice” in your crummy town that ever doubted your ability to escape, while also acknowledging that those people might be right. “You can’t lie to yourself that it’s the chance of a lifetime,” he sings, which is all the more remarkable for the surging, life-affirming music that surrounds it. The point of “Motor Away” isn’t to give up hope because the destination might not end up being what you envision, but rather to enjoy the thrill ride that takes you there. On Alien Lanes, the journey is what matters—the act of creation, the party in the garage, that magical sensation of being carried to the lake, even if the lake turns out to be dry. In the meantime, do not fret. The bus will get you there yet. The club is open. \"],[22368,\"It’s been a slow transformation (and a decade of beard-growing) for former Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir, who hasn’t released a studio album since Ratdog’s Evening Moods in 2000. As co-creator of a jam-friendly musical language with the Dead, the 68-year-old Weir has never entirely been able to escape that musical flavor during his collaborations with numerous lyricists and producers, almost all geared towards live performances in front of dancing audiences. However, on what is unquestionably his best solo release since 1972’s Ace, Blue Mountain finds Weir in territory that is both new and intimately familiar. Produced by longtime auxiliary National member Josh Kaufman, and working with songwriter Josh Ritter, a gaggle of National members, jammers, and others, Blue Mountain returns Weir to the American west of the Dead’s youth, populated by rivers and trains and cloud-scapes, all flickering at the edge of magic.Pitched as Weir’s “cowboy album”—and the songs are largely about that—Mountain is both a collection of contemporary Americana and something more. While some of the material would likely sound at home in the Dead’s repertoire, like the good-natured gallop of “Gonesville,” it’s hard to imagine the latter lineups of the band treating the music quite so elegantly as Kaufman and company. Most often, the album lands Weir in thick-aired spaces not dissimilar to Daniel Lanois’ work with Bob Dylan, like the humming spaghetti western chorale of “Ghost Towns” and the misty alt-folk stomp of “Lay My Lilly Down.”As Weir’s sixth studio full-length outside the Grateful Dead, Blue Mountain functionally serves as a reboot for the guitarist, whose solo sensibility long ago veered far from Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter’s cosmic Americana and into the AOR waters of 1978’s Heaven Help the Fool (made with Fleetwood Mac producer Keith Olsen), the pastel fusion of Bobby and the Midnites in the ’80s, and the dense jam-jazz of Ratdog in the ’90s. With an ambient C&W production that often subsumes lead guitar into the reverb swirl (and occasionally swallows Weir), Blue Mountain will likewise probably prove inseparable from the historical period in which it was recorded. But, unlike Weir’s previous albums, Blue Mountain also finally seems like the right album at the right time for Weir. Quietly adventurous, wise, and a welcome late-career turn, Blue Mountain builds an ethereal home for a rhythm guitarist who was tempered in the chaos-friendly environs of Dead. Filled with deep folk allusions and cowpoke asides about Mormon girls and Red River Valleys, Blue Mountain is very much a Josh Ritter album, too, who guides Weir back to the emotional turf of 1970’s American Beauty and Workingman’s Dead. But Ritter's lyrics sometimes teeter between timeless imagery and folksy platitudes, with the chorus of “Only A River” and other moments sounding a bit more like a musical about folk music.But one of the nicest surprises of Weir's recent tours with his former bandmates—and what really sells Blue Mountain—is the vocal gravitas developed during Weir’s two decades of life and music after the Dead. In many ways, Blue Mountain is merely a vehicle for it, which itself is quietly miraculous. “Bobby Fans Are People Too” asserted a bumper sticker sold on Grateful Dead tour, neatly summarizing the junior Dead guitarist’s spot in the band’s canon. Long acting as an overblown short-short-wearing counterbalance to Jerry Garcia’s stoned (and sometimes somnambulant) cool, on Blue Mountain, Weir finally achieves some of the grace that Garcia possessed so easily from a young age.Perhaps Blue Mountain’s most striking track is the totally solo “Ki-Yi Bossie,” one of a half-dozen songs in Weir’s 50-year career credited to him alone. A wide-eyed C&W strum set in “a 12-step meeting under harsh fluorescent light,” it’s the only moment of Blue Mountain that takes place in the unaffected present, and not coincidentally, the only place where Weir seems to express something of himself. Never mind the song as an account of sobriety, Weir’s grizzled hippie verse tags (“Well, alright, right on…”) and wry lyrics about searching for meaning and saving whales make it a 21st century Marin County cowboy lullaby. Minus producers or songwriters or bandmates, it’s a place for Weir's steps alone, suggesting a wide open territory still waiting to be explored.\"],[22430,\"Overnight success is rarely that, but in the case of experimental synth group S U R V I V E, you’d be forgiven for assuming that they arrived fully-formed this past summer. Two of their members collaborated on the Stranger Things OST, Vol. One and Two, the soundtrack to Netflix’s zeitgeist-consuming sci-fi TV series. Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein’s uncanny ear for ’80s synthesizers—not to mention their proclivity for building their own from scratch—was absolutely perfect for scoring a supernatural thriller set in the Reagan Era. But as one-half of S U R V I V E’s four-person outfit (they’re joined by Adam Jones and Mark Donica, on even more synths), they now find themselves at a crossroads. With the band’s newfound success, their fans will surely be looking for the points of reference that hooked them in the first place: the film compositions of John Carpenter, Tangerine Dream, Giorgio Moroder, and even Vangelis’ less grandiose moments.And while those influences are abundant on their new album RR7349, the challenge here, as with any band who becomes suddenly popular, is to avoid that albatross and temper those expectations with enough individuality to stay true to their core sound and identity. It's not an easy balance, but the album gets there, and once it settles into its slick groove, is unrelenting in its deconstruction of their soundtrack work. Despite, or perhaps because of the restrictions of their instrumentation, S U R V I V E’s music has gone through a range of tones and atmospheres since their inception only seven years ago. 2012’s HD009 (all of the band's releases are simply titled after their catalog number) consists of two tracks, both exactly 22:06 minutes long, interacting like mirrored reflections of the same ambient piece of music. That year they also released Mnq026, a record that more closely resembles the structure and tone of the Stranger Things OST, while maintaining the eerie sparsity that permeated their music up to that point.However, the slight of hand that S U R V I V E recreate across all of their records has nothing to do with ambiance, or underrated cinematic touchstones, or even their vast knowledge of their cherished instruments, which, credit where credit’s due, rightfully make up for much of the band's appeal. The most difficult part of making instrumental, non-dance electronic music for an audience beyond your typical avant-garde connoisseur is injecting it with a sense of narrative, a story, an energy that replaces vocals and conventional musical structures to give the tracks an augmented dimension. S U R V I V E are very good at this. They may be one of the best bands currently employing those skills, and RR7349 is their most succinct example yet.As engrossing and brilliant as the Stranger Things OST is, its success relies, much like the TV series, largely on its capacity to mimic the feel of an era. There’s not a moment on it that is as stomach-lurching as “Dirt,” an early highlight of RR7349; like most of the tracks on the album, it's sensory almost to the point of overwhelmingness. The pulsating “Sorcerer” is built around a harsh, driving percussive synth line that bulldozes almost everything underneath it, and when a drum machine actually does pierce through the layers and layers of foggy keyboards, like on “Copter,” it’s so arresting it almost jolts you out of your seat.The album closes with “Cutthroat,” its best track, a composition so deliciously creepy you almost wish it were accompanying a particularly splattery scene of mayhem. Its arpeggiated squelches swirl in an unsettling void until, little by little, deep bass and tinkering chimes begin to seep in, and suddenly, the next thing you know, you're caught under the weight of the track's increasing paranoia. Based on “Cutthroat” alone, it’s clear that S U R V I V E’s capacity for imagination and evocation goes well beyond homages to film scores of the 1980s, and much like the machines they meticulously build to create their dense soundscapes, they’ll continue to tweak and augment their sound until the unholy day their monstrous creation is completed.\"],[22346,\"There was a time when Steve Reich had few champions. Now he wins the Pulitzer Prize, collaborates with Jonny Greenwood, and on various anniversaries of the composer’s birth, concert halls the world over schedule celebrations of his catalog. But in the late ’60s and early ’70s, during his hardcore minimalist period, labels offered only sporadic commitments, including one-and-done relationships with both Columbia and Deutsche Grammophon. Before the American vanguard of minimalism would be canonized in classical circles, someone would have to demonstrate long-term confidence in Reich’s art.In 1978, Manfred Eicher’s ECM imprint offered the first issue of Music for 18 Musicians, after famously spiriting the tapes away from a tentative Deutsche Grammophon. (The latter had been sitting on the album for years, after paying to record it in 1976.) Eicher’s trend-spotting sense proved keen: The jazz label’s first “classical” release eventually sold over 100,000 copies. ECM followed up this success as soon as they could, with a collection of shorter Reich pieces from his past, one of which was already more than a decade old. After a third LP—the recorded debut of Tehillim—Reich moved with onetime ECM employee Bob Hurwitz to the label Nonesuch, his recording home ever since. Thanks to the early ECM albums, three twists in the composer’s early development were more widely appreciated. Here you could identify Reich as the stylistic upstart, the composer achieving a breakthrough, and the artist who—in the aftermath of that breakthrough—needed to plot a new course. Instead of moving chronologically by date-of-composition, the reissue works in order of original release, starting with the event that was Music for 18 Musicians.  Though some classical critics of the era objected to what one described as Reich’s “robot or zombie music,” Music for 18 Musicians has always inspired an enthusiastic response. The piece contained the steady pulse of early minimalism—an influence on all manners of electronic subgenres. There are likewise elements from Reich’s pioneering works with “phasing,” though these do not overwhelm the piece. The harmonic movement that keeps each section of Musicians feeling active was a relatively recent development in Reich’s sound, as well. Musicologist Keith Potter describes the overall effect as “on-the-edge” Reich—with the composer delighting in the apotheosis of his prior techniques while at the same time discovering new ones. It also helped that his band was in fearsome health. Over 59 minutes, they whip through the opening (which introduces the 11 different chords that will be explored), progress through twelve different meditations on those chords (the third chord inspires two “movements”), before quickly revisiting the initial tour through the sequence and then fading away into silence. Every quality performance of Music for 18 Musicians is capable of unearthing some fresh-sounding detail from Reich’s nests of rhythm and harmony. But this inaugural recording excels in two aspects that make for an unlikely pair: it’s one of the fastest renditions ever, and also one of the most tender. One moment of power-plus-poetry comes in the thirteenth minute of this recording, during the piece’s “IIIA” section. After this movement has established fast, interlocking patterns for violin, piano, marimba and xylophone, there is a dramatic addition of slow-moving pairs of notes for the cello. When set against the antic performance of the other parts, the melancholic feel embedded in the ensemble’s low-string instrument becomes all the more affecting. The constant churn of the work can tempt you to think of its appeal as ethereal, fit for background listening. But then some unexpected change—a complication of the suggested tonal center, or a transmutation of instrumental color—winds up commanding your attention. This wealth of textural variation rebuts those objections to Reich’s work as being somehow on auto-pilot. Late in the piece, the melodic construction may seem familiar, but changed—reflecting Reich’s metaphor in the liner notes about the relationship between sections being like “resemblances between members of a family.” Each individual entity within this “family” of movements also possesses multiple humors and whims. It’s the consistently malleable quality of this music that has made the capstone to Reich’s purely minimalist period so fiercely loved by separate and overlapping communities of classical and pop artists. In his book The Rest Is Noise, New Yorker critic Alex Ross recalled observing the fast-spreading appeal of this sound, writing that in the ’80s and ’90s, “...you could walk into any hip boutique or hotel lounge and sooner or later hear some distant, burbling cousin of Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians.”Where to go next? Reich took some time to figure this out—eventually composing a piece called Music for a Large Ensemble two years later. It’s shorter and not as formally impressive as Music for 18 Musicians, though Reich continues his quest to slowly investigate all the instruments of the conventional orchestra (adding double bass, this time around). It wasn’t long enough for a recording on its own, even when combined with 1979’s more inspired Octet (later rearranged and retitled Eight Lines). So ECM paired these compositions with a much older one: “Violin Phase.” Eicher’s production of that late-’60s composition has a luxuriant stereo separation that makes it an ideal way to experience the rhythmic ambiguity of Reich’s electro-acoustic layering.This spare and resonant production aesthetic carries over to the final Reich recording on ECM, on 1982’s Tehillim. Based on his study of Jewish cantillation, it represents the composer’s next big leap forward to the realm of melody. His settings of biblical psalms are flat-out catchy. The rhythmic play is still complex and engaging, but this is the piece that proved Reich’s career would outlast the burst of minimalism’s first widespread acceptance by popular audiences in the ’70s. The recording released by ECM is the chamber version of Tehillim; a later recording conducted by Alan Pierson for Nonesuch has a more vehement force. But vehemence isn’t the only lens through which to explore Reich’s lovely writing. Produced during Reich’s 80th birthday year, this reissue package includes all of the composer’s original liner notes to those three LPs, as well as several session photos and a new essay. But the principal draw is the same as ever. Better than any other comparably sized collection, this trio of albums offers a crisp overview of 15 dramatic years in the composer’s development.\"],[22388,\"To get an idea of the cryptic compositions made by California-born, now Japan-based composer Carl Stone, consider the three folks who give appreciations on this hefty compilation, Electronic Music From the Seventies and Eighties. One comes from respected world music critic Richard Gehr; another from the author of the 33 1\\/3 book on Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works Vol. II; a third from the guy who conveys ethnic dish profundity throughout Greater Los Angeles, the Pulitzer Prize-winning food critic Jonathan Gold. Stone has had an equally un-slottable career since studying electronic music composition at CalArts with the likes of Morton Subotnick and James Tenney in the 1970s and performing with Japanese noisy improvisers like Otomo Yoshihide. Gold, for one, recalled seeing Stone perform around L.A. at upper-crust concert halls, nightclubs, punk venues, and art galleries.By-turns lovely, prickly, meditative, and maddening, these eight extended compositions (some two and a half hours of music) showcase drastically different sides of Stone’s work, which previously was relegated to small batch cassette releases in the ’80s and early ’90s. An early adopter of the computer, which he used to create his pieces, Stone’s also worked with turntables and manically manipulated samples. He has electronically elongated source sounds until they take on entirely new topographies. These techniques anticipated later trends of all sorts, from the dense slivers of samples informing the Bomb Squad’s productions to Plunderphonic’s trash-compacting of pop music to Justin Bieber 800% Slower. The earliest pieces here, “Lim” and “Chao Praya” date to the early ’70s when Stone was still a student at CalArts, utilizing a Buchla 200 series synthesizer to seek out the purest, most transportive of tones. These two pieces are stunning indeed, full of purring drones that at first appear to hardly be moving, only to have them slowly slide and reveal infinite amounts of overtones. It’s evocative of some of my favorite minimal music from this era, be it Charlemagne Palestine’s Four Manifestations on Six Elements or Folke Rabe’s Was??.The stately “Sukothai” and ethereal “Shing Kee” come from 1977 and 1986, respectively, and both find Stone mincing a single musical ingredient into myriad dishes (the Gold connection becomes apparent in that Stone titled many of his pieces after his favorite L.A. restaurants). On “Sukothai,” he takes a sliver of harpsichord from Benjamin Britten’s already playful “Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra” and—in a process similar to Steve Reich’s Come Out—teases it into two loops and then four. Stone exponentially increases them across a dizzying 14 minutes, until that dainty harpsichord line turns into a canon of a hefty 1024 loops. A similar process informs “Shing Kee,” as a five-second snippet of Schubert’s “The Linden Tree” gets distended in two directions. Small slivers of Akiko Yano’s voice are stretched into abstract yowls, but ever so slowly it tightens until the syllables become audible and the fully-sung line becomes clear. Then the piece retreats, with Stone stretching everything back from word to clouds, these small filaments spun into a blanket of abstract sound once again.By the ’80s, Stone’s methods and focus began to shift. “Dong Il Jang,” from 1982, starts off as if it will be a droning soundscape, only to have it strobe and fragment. A sample of “testing one, two, three” and snatches of Asian folk music get worried into a maddening hiccup. If only the resultant 21 minutes sounded like something other than simply holding the fast-forward button on a CD player.The massive “Kuk Il Kwan” strikes a balance between the two poles of Stone’s sound, moving from droning to churning, while “Shibucho” is another long piece of a finely diced sample. This time, Stone renders one of the dreamiest Temptations’ songs into an irritant like a severely scratched disc stuck in a six-disc changer. In the years since, this sound has been taken up by the likes of Japanese artist Yasunao Tone’s Solo for Wounded CD and Oval. But there’s something about the immense serving portions of Stone’s glitching pieces that—unlike some of the stunning other work to be found here—ultimately makes them hard to swallow.\"],[22420,\"There’s a line deep in Thomas Pynchon’s Inherent Vice wherein Doc, a small-time stoner-sleuth, considers the dissolution of the 1960s, wondering if the decade wasn’t merely “a little parenthesis of light, might close after all, and all be lost, taken back into darkness.” It’s a funny way to think about time—that an entire era can be nudged back into the ether, erased. But on 22, A Million, the extraordinary third full-length from Bon Iver, Justin Vernon echoes Doc’s somber pondering. These are fluttery, skeletal songs that struggle against known trajectories and then threaten to disappear entirely. 22, A Million might be musically distant from For Emma, Forever Ago, the collection of aching folk tunes Vernon debuted in 2007—mostly gone are the acoustic strums, replaced by lurching, electronic gasps born from the Messina, a doctored combination of the Prismizer software plug-in and some hardware that was invented by Vernon and his engineer, Chris Messina. But the albums share an ideology. All things go, taken back into darkness. 22, A Million is certainly Bon Iver’s most difficult record; it’s the work of a songwriter who seems to have lost interest in established, easily deciphered forms, a possibility Vernon has been hinting at for nearly all of his career. In 2006, Vernon, then living in North Carolina, was emotionally razed by a perfect storm of shitty turns: his band broke up, his relationship dissolved, he came down with an acute case of mononucleosis. He did what any reasonable person with an eye toward self-care would do: decamp to his family’s hunting cabin in rural Wisconsin, drink a gang of beers, watch endless hours of “Northern Exposure,” and write a batch of lonesome, yearning folk songs on his acoustic guitar. His high, brittle falsetto gave these pieces an otherworldly quality, as if they had blown in on a particularly cold wind. For Emma, Forever Ago was, in its own way, an experimental record—Vernon’s vocals and phrasing are deeply unusual; its stories are impressionistic, fractured—but because it’s so heavy with heartbreak and loss, it feels intimate, authentic, easy. 22, A Million is comparatively strange and exploratory, but its worries are more existential. The album opens with a high, undulating voice (Vernon, singing into an OP-1, a combination synthesizer, sampler, and sequencer) announcing, “It might be over soon,” and goes on to examine the idea of impermanence. Nearly all of its songs contain a question of some sort, as if Vernon’s own reckoning with the inevitability of decay has led him to interrogate every last thing he’s seen or known. Inasmuch as his lyrics are narrative—and they have always been more connotative than exegetic—he seems preoccupied with whether or not a life has meaning. “Oh then, how we gonna cry? Cause it once might not mean something?” he asks on “715 - CRΣΣKS.”Kanye West once called Vernon his “favorite living artist,” and has long professed a deep and unexpected admiration for “Woods,” the closing track from 2009’s Blood Bank EP, and an obvious precursor to “715 - CRΣΣKS,” itself a kind of warped a capella jam. “Woods” featured no instrumentation, but is merely five minutes of Vernon singing through Auto-Tune, in ghostly harmony with himself. In retrospect, “Woods” feels like a revelation: it was not only an unexpected affirmation of pop’s future—artists aggressively distorting their vocals, feeding their voices into machines in order to build spectral, nagging songs that reflect alienation, arguably the reigning sensation of our time—but of Vernon’s own trajectory. Plenty of beloved contemporary artists, from Dylan to Neil Young on, have ditched the supposed purity of folk music to push the work harder, to make art that’s less reliant on a tradition and invests, instead, in the strangeness of the present moment and collective uncertainty about the future. Trading on preexisting pathways—it’s too easy. Vernon isn’t alone in his hunger for true, tectonic innovation, for songs that seem tethered to and reflective of their actual time and place: Radiohead has been mirroring anxiety about the encroachment of electronics and virtual living since Kid A, a record that also required them to warp if not abandon their beginnings as a guitar-rock band.Beyond its sonic striving, 22, A Million is also a personal record about how to move forward through disorienting times. Vernon occasionally employs religious language to express his anxiety, some explicit (“consecration,” “confirmation”), some more plainly vernacular (“So as I’m standing at the station,” “I could go forward in the light”). He samples two gospel tunes: Mahalia Jackson’s live version of “How I Got Over,” from 1962, and the Supreme Jubilees’s “Standing in the Need of Prayer,” from 1980. There is a song titled “666 ʇ,” and another titled “33 ‘GOD.’” A bit of marginalia in the album’s liner notes (“Why are you so FAR from saving me?”) is attributed to Psalm 22, though in the King James Bible, that imploration is for help, not salvation (“Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?”). Either way, Psalm 22 opens in medias res: its author is undergoing an urgent crisis of faith. So is Vernon?Maybe. Musically, Vernon resists not just verse-chorus-verse, but all the ways in which Western cultures have come to conceptualize narrative. As kids, we’re taught how stories work, and we use that rubric to organize and make sense of the events of our lives. But the imposition of structure can be violent; perhaps, Vernon suggests, the idea that we are organizing events at all is patently nuts. So when he ventures a line like “We’ve galvanized the squall of it all,” from “8 (circle),” it feels like a mission statement. There is solace in resisting formal structures, in both acknowledging and embracing a certain amount of chaos. It’s the same story on “00000 Million,” the album’s haunting closing track, where Vernon samples a wobbly line borrowed from the Irish folksinger Fionn Regan: “The days have no numbers.” Pitted against the record’s obsessive numerology—each song has a number in its title—it lands like an admission of defeat. There’s resignation in his voice, which gives way to desolation. The song’s lyrics will be familiar to anyone wondering if they’ll ever actually start to feel better, while still continuing to do something they know is hurting them: “If it’s harmed, it harmed me, it’ll harm me, I let it in.” For a while now, Vernon has been building songs in a modular way, and there are moments here (like the meandering last minute of “21 M♢♢N WATER”) where it feels as if he could’ve jiggled the pieces together a little more—where his disavowal of connective tissue feels less deliberate than random. This is evident, in part, because he is exceptionally good at writing melancholic laments in the highly structured style of ’80s soft-rock giants like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby (Vernon has covered Raitt’s “I Can’t Make You Love Me,” and Vernon and Hornsby have collaborated on several occasions; “00000 Million” feels like it could have been recorded by either). “8 (circle)” is the most immediately reminiscent of Vernon’s last record, Bon Iver, Bon Iver, itself now recognizable as a clear midpoint between Emma and here; it’s also the album’s most conventionally composed track, with the smallest amount of vocal manipulation. Elsewhere, Vernon’s vocals are filtered until they begin to actually dissolve, as if they have been dunked in a tub of lye. The song’s stunning emotional peaks—I come to a full stop every time I hear Vernon sing, “I’m standing in the street now, and I carry his guitar,” his voice steady and deep, as if he’s announcing himself to someone he loves—are so plainly beautiful it’s hard not to mourn, briefly, for the Bon Iver of yesteryear.But 22, A Million sounds only like itself. There are precedents for all of Vernon’s moves deep in the histories of rock‘n’roll and rhythm and blues and electronic music—and, more immediately, on newer records by West, Frank Ocean, James Blake, Chance the Rapper, Francis and the Lights, and Radiohead. But this particular amalgamation is so twitchy and idiosyncratic it feels truly singular. Its searching is bottomless.\"],[22298,\"Richard D. James is like the Miles Davis of electronic music: Both started young and had inventive, deeply personal styles. Both created a few genres and perfected others that were already well-trod. Both were wildly prolific, then took long breaks and basically disappeared when they were functioning at exceptionally high levels. And both made very little music that was less than good.So you might consider Expert Knob Twiddlers to be James’ version of Quiet Nights. A collaboration between James and his friend Mike Paradinas, who has worked as μ-Ziq (and many other names) and founded the Planet Mu label, it’s the rare James-related release that is just OK. It’s also one of the less interesting things Paradinas made during his excellent ’90s run. The fact that it wasn’t all that common in shops and was a rare collaborative release from James gave it a bit of an aura that, two decades later, doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. It sounds like two friends who enjoy making music together having some fun and entertaining themselves, without much thought for quality control.Though it’s a low-key record that doesn’t pretend to be about innovation, Expert Knob Twiddlers is interesting as a time capsule. It was recorded on relatively crude equipment in 1994, when both James and Paradinas were working at an early peak and releasing massive amounts of music under a variety of names, and it was released in ’96, when James was basically a superstar as Aphex Twin. In every gesture, it feels tied to the mid-’90s, offering Mike and Rich’s version of the Gen X nostalgia that was everywhere at the time. (Just look at that album cover.) Many of these tracks either sample from or are the creators’ versions of ephemera like ’60s spy film soundtracks, easy listening records, off-kilter funk, advertising jingles, and the like—a jumble of kitschy loops that could have come from Keyboard Money Mark, Sukia, or any number of lesser artists making music in that decade with cheap gear and samples. There’s very little to distinguish these playful genre exercises, well constructed as they are.Not to say it’s a bad record, just one of little depth. Expert Knob Twiddlers is marginally improved in this reissue, complete with additional unreleased tracks from the initial sessions, a fuller-sounding remastering, and a new sequence that suggests a bit more variety than is actually here. There are occasional moments of inspiration, like the tense and jittery “Vodka”—which appears a second time in a new, less interesting mix—or “Bu Bu Bu Ba,” a slow and dreamy number with a pleasant melody. But too many tracks are along the lines of “Winner Takes All” and “Giant Deflating Football”—essentially, just a single string loop and occasionally a breakbeat, repeating for almost six minutes with small accents placed here and there. Listening to the album is a matter of expectations. Set aside that it pairs two giants of electronic music and enjoy it for what it is: a collection of well-rendered DJ tools for your next lounge music night.\"],[22304,\"To hear Thomas Brinkmann tell it, his childhood piano lessons were more traumatic than most. A self-described musical dyslexic, he struggled to decipher the marks on the page, while the rest of his family members took to the instrument with virtuosic skill. Brinkmann sought his escape in make-believe: He pretended that his grandfather’s harmonium was the cockpit of an airplane. Yanking knobs and stomping pedals, he imagined himself wrestling the truculent beast through the most difficult takeoffs and landings.With A 1000 Keys, Brinkmann finally gets his revenge on the instrument. Dedicated to Conlon Nancarrow, the modernist composer who wrote extensively for the player piano, it is an ornery, brutish album that hammers like a migraine, which is the sole aspect of the piano that he emphasizes. (To underscore that point, the album opens with three minutes of what sounds like mechanized blast beats.) There are no melodies here, just a steady, MIDI-driven pummel of chord clusters: Imagine a set of pistons suspended over the keys, striking over and over until the ivory cracks and the ebony splinters. There are occasional breaks from the assault in the form of languid, atonal fantasias—played according to the same principle, basically, just with the tempo slowed way down and the sustain pedal held to the floor. The throbbing “TLV,” one of a few tracks for organ, sounds like his grandfather's harmonium has been set on fire.This being Brinkmann, there’s method to his mashing. Whether slicing records with razor blades or sampling Continental philosophers, the German electronic musician has always been part trickster and part theoretician. To create the music, Brinkmann apparently translated the frequencies corresponding to A440 tuning, or standard concert pitch, to binary code, and then used the 1s and 0s as sequencer data. That interest in the interchangeability of rhythm and frequency extends from his last album, What You Hear (Is What You Hear), in which seemingly static pitches gradually opened up to reveal an all-encompassing throb—except where that record inscribed graceful moiré patterns in thin air, A 1000 Keys tackles the subject with the grim determination of a jackhammer operator.Treating frequency as a kind of readymade is one way of flipping the bird at all those composers whose work he failed to learn as a boy; the album’s methods, and its skepticism of authorial genius, invoke both Arnold Schoenberg’s 12-tone technique and Marcel Duchamp’s urinal. But there's nonetheless something unmistakably expressive about these gruff, pugilistic miniatures. As if owning up to it, he even titles the tracks after the three-letter codes of various international airports: “JFK,” “SFO,” “LHR,” and so forth. The press release frames the titles in terms of sterile “non-places,” but I think it’s just the opposite: Is it a coincidence that the lurching “CGN” mimics the rhythmic signature of classic Cologne techno? Far from flattening the frequency spectrum into interchangeable strings of digits, those references to faraway places underscore the vast range of destinations made possible by Brinkmann's brutalist flights of fancy.Where A 1000 Keys is hard, A Certain Degree of Stasis is soft; where one is percussive, the other is liquid, with a sound like Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music melted down and poured into Gastr Del Sol’s swirling organ drones. Where the former is ostensibly process music, there's no indication of how the latter was made. The double-CD set, released by Helsinki’s fledgling Frozen Reeds label, home to recordings from Julius Eastman and Morton Feldman, feels less like a musical composition than a piece of installation art—a sensation that’s reinforced both by its cover art, a detail of a piece by the visual artist Agnes Lux, and by the instructions that its two discs may be played separately, together, or along with any other Frozen Reeds release. Just for fun, I tried out both discs alongside Kevin Drumm’s Imperial Horizon, and the effect was pretty sublime.On both discs—each comprises a single, 48-minute track—the “melody,” as it were, resembles the creak of a metal gate on rusty hinges; the atmosphere is as muggy as the heat before a summer storm. There are no discernible musical events, just lighter and darker streaks of dissonance, like smudges on battered brass. After a while, you begin hearing things that may or may not actually be in the recording. Are those wind chimes? Crickets? Is Glenn Branca leading a procession of electric guitarists through the tall, dry grass? Play both discs at once, and the sensation multiplies tenfold, leaving you wrapped in a cocoon of auditory illusions.To those unfamiliar with the full scope of Brinkmann’s work, there’s little to suggest that both albums are by the same artist, even though they share in common a doggedness that could be exhausting to anyone in search of a simpler, more readily digestible listening experience. The excess of A Certain Degree of Stasis is almost absurd, except that it isn’t; to stop time and allow listeners to disappear into these fields of color requires painting on an enormous canvas. Even Brinkmann’s biggest fans may be surprised at how emotionally resonant and flat-out gorgeous these dissonant ambient studies are. If A 1000 Keys finds Brinkmann grappling with the controls of the imaginary airplanes of his childhood, with A Certain Degree of Stasis, he breaks through the clouds and soars.  \"],[22425,\"At first glance, Psychic TV bandleader Genesis P-Orridge would seem a most unlikely champion of nostalgia. As co-founder of trailblazing ’70s noise act Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge became the unwitting progenitor of industrial music—just one of several milestones in a multi-faceted career defined by a rabid dedication to non-conformity. And even when P-Orridge switched from Throbbing Gristle’s collagist technique to song-based structures with the formation of Psychic TV in 1981, the subversive streak remained intact.But as this latest installment in a series of covers-themed releases proves, P-Orridge has long harbored a romance for musical tradition. You can go all the way back to Psychic TV’s first album Force the Hand of Chance to hear hints of P-Orridge’s childhood affinity for early, pre-rock forms of pop. That album, in fact, begins with P-Orridge singing, “You caress me with simple love,” over an orchestral string arrangement. Looking back, it appears as if P-Orridge was being totally sincere, but in the wake of Sid Vicious’ “My Way” and with the corpse of Throbbing Gristle still warm, the song must have come across as ironic at the time.On Alienist, P-Orridge and the current incarnation of the band come to celebrate the past. Given P-Orridge’s history of provocation, Psychic TV aren’t interested in preserving anyone’s comfortable idea of the status quo. Nevertheless, the band’s renditions of singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson’s \\\\\"Jump Into the Fire\\\\\" and ’60s psychedelic outfit the Creation’s “How Does It Feel to Feel” stay faithful to the sonic character of the original versions. Still, the very act of picking those two tunes expands rather than fortifies the definition of pop music. It also says a lot about the band’s unwillingness to pander to the obvious—even as they play with nothing to prove.If Psychic TV sound like a bar band on these covers, it’s a bar band that puts a lot of thought into its choice of songs. Since 2009, Psychic TV have recorded covers of Funkadelic’s “Maggot Brain,” Hawkwind’s “Silver Machine,” Can’s \\\\\"Mother Sky,\\\\\" and Captain Beefheart’s “Dropout Boogie,” releasing the covers as 12-inches once a year with new original tunes as B-sides. Alienist presents two covers and two originals that together clock-in at 34 minutes—long enough to qualify as a full-length but slanted closer to the mixed-bag personality an EP.P-Orridge and drummer\\/producer\\/band director Edward O’Dowd (formerly of the Toilet Boys) don’t make very many radical alterations. The archetypal ’70s-guitar churn of “Jump Into the Fire,” for example, is panned to the right side of the stereo field, just like in Nilsson’s original. But keyboardist John Weingarten’s left-panned piano rolls burst with color and vibrancy where Nilsson’s merely served as an accompaniment. On both covers, in fact, the band oozes with an unguarded joy that’s downright life-affirming.Meanwhile, the two original songs provide contrast. “I’m Looking for You,” a space-rock dirge, hovers in the same darkly reflective mood for almost 12 minutes, with P-Orridge sounding sinister, weary, and wise all at once. And on the title track, Psychic TV give us an organic version of electronic music as P-Orridge—a somewhat warbly but nevertheless convincing singer—muses about alienation in a robotic monotone over an upbeat dance rhythm played on live drums.The term “rock and roll” all too often functions as a mantra for reinforcing boundaries, shorthand for “Weren’t things better back in simpler times?” The suggestion that the past was somehow better, more innocent and purer lends itself, consciously or not, to conservative social ideals. That Psychic TV can reach to the past without appealing to such regressive attitudes is just one of the qualities that give Alienist its charm. That they still sound vital and wide-eyed doing it makes it a triumph.\"],[22444,\"There are only about 45 seconds left on Nicolas Jaar’s new album Sirens when something astounding happens. Heralded by a selection of drums and birdcall synths, a gospel cry arrives, shrouded in distortion and punctuated by sharp arrhythmic drumming. The most useful words to describe this are the silliest and most hyperbolic: awesome, transcendent, timeless or more accurately, out-of-time. It begs for pretension, for the vocabulary of divinity and “high art,” for references to religious philosophers and poets of the West that you barely remember from college, Milton and Kierkegaard, Eliot and Blake. And though there are many similarly striking moments on Sirens, this one stands out for its brevity and particular beauty. It is a moment thoroughly earned by the album that precedes it, and in less than a minute, it’s gone.This moment—a supernova flash of prodigious skill—can be seen as something of a stand-in for Jaar’s career to date. In 2011, when Jaar was just 21, he released his debut album, Space Is Only Noise, introducing a downtempo combination of psychedelia and dance music that vaulted him into the vanguard of the world’s electronic artists. The record came alive in a room, its amorphous body emerging from the stereo, its limbs unfolding into every corner. His ability to conjure up what seemed like an extra dimension in his music made you aware of the tautology: space was noise, but he made noise seem like space.The next year Jaar revealed the depth of his talent for collage with his Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1. These mixes are often superlative, but his felt more personal than most, even as it showcased his interest in referencing the texts of others. In one of many sophisticated in-jokes, Jaar, who is Chilean-American, introduced the operative sample from Jay Z’s “My 1st Song,” with Jay Z’s own voice. That vocal prepared listeners to hear the Black Album closer before Jaar dropped the original version, “Tu y Tu Mirar, Yo y Mi Cancion,” by the Chilean band, Los Ángeles Negros, in its place. The mix was filled with moments like these—jam-packed with allusions but still absorbing for those who didn’t catch the references.And then, Jaar shrank away from center stage. In 2013, he started his own label, Other People, partly to foster the careers of his musician friends. Jaar is a generous collaborator—artists like Dave Harrington, his partner in the duo Darkside, have been eager to credit his willingness to help them with their own work. But the instinct to work with others may not have been purely selfless. Jaar felt enormous pressure to replicate his early success. In an interview with Pitchfork in 2013, he confessed that he was scared of releasing music that wasn’t up to those standards:“For the first five years of making music, I did it because I had fun,” he said. “When it started to get real, I was like, ‘Now if I put out something else and it's not as good as what I did before, people will start thinking I suck.’”So Jaar produced others’ projects and made critically acclaimed records with Harrington under the Darkside moniker. But slowly, over the last two years, he’s been creeping back toward the microphone, using his own name. First there were some extraordinary singles. Then, last summer’s Pomegranates, a slippery alternate soundtrack to an old Russian film. Then Nymphs—an uncollected EP, maybe?—excellent, but difficult to evaluate holistically.Sirens represents a full reemergence, as close as he may ever get to kicking over the mic stand. He doesn't reveal many new tricks, but his knowledge of his own palette is masterful in every moment. More poetic and thoughtful than ever before, Jaar maintains an ability to fit seemingly disparate sounds together as if they were always meant to find each other. Add the strands of political expression that are gathered on Sirens, often cloaked in odd textures, in Spanish, or in cryptic lyrics, and you have a record as compelling as any of Jaar’s other works.It opens with the track “Killing Time,” which feels like entering a labyrinth, or maybe a pyramid, something forbidding and funereal. The sound of a flag waves in the wind, keys like jagged wind chimes shatter on the floor. Nico is patient, but understands the need for progression, and though slower songs like this may linger in silence or briefly lavish attention on a particular effect, riff, or drum sound, they never stop moving.“Killing Time,” is silent, respectful, matching its lyrics (“We were just waiting…”) And then “The Governor” which shares a post-punk edge with another song, “Three Sides of Nazareth,” jolts the record into sudden motion. Those two tracks, with their driving rhythms and clear lyrics, are the easiest to glom on to on first listen. The words are more or less affixed to the music, in contrast with other tracks like “Killing Time” and parts of “No,” where lyrics seem to dwell in the spacious labyrinth evoked by the sound. On those tracks, you’re never sure exactly where you’re going to stumble upon a sudden string of words, of thoughts.\\\\\"The Governor\\\\\" is fast and loud and urgent. When I listened to it out of sequence, I wondered whether those qualities were imposed on “The Governor” because it's only fast and loud and urgent in comparison to “Killing Time,” or whether it actually is those things. These are the kind of thoughts that psychedelia provokes at its best, and Jaar adores these puzzles. It’s his obsession with setting up dichotomies and resolving them that places him firmly in a Western tradition. He’s able to work a kind of alchemy upon the raw elements of his music, making one thing into its polar opposite: hard into soft, ugly into pretty, slow into fast. Like the word “sirens” itself, (the ancient temptress, the modern alarms), his music is able to evoke opposing ideas at the same time. These contradictions give Sirens its strength, particularly during the album’s centerpiece, the song \\\\\"No.\\\\\" It’s the only segment of music on the digital version of the album that includes a musical element not written, recorded, performed, mixed, and produced by Nico. (It’s a Chilean harp piece, “Lagrimas,” by Sergio Cuevas.) This section helps us to understand the mystery at the heart of Sirens, represented by the line of Spanish lyrics adorning its cover. The end of “Leaves,” the entirety of “No,” and the beginning of “Three Sides of Nazareth,” orbit around two conversations. The first seems to be a recording of a young Nico speaking with his father, the artist Alfredo Jaar. They discuss a statue being attacked by lions. The words of “No” are in Spanish, and they contain the second discussion, which serves as a parable that illuminates the first. An unhappy neighbor approaches Nico, and they discuss multiple contradictions—the far and the near, the inside and the outside. But the core of their conversation are the words from Sirens’ cover: “Ya dijimos no pero el si esta en todo.” This translates as: “We already said no but the yes is in everything,” a reference to the Chilean national plebiscite, a 1988 referendum on democracy in the country. In the referendum, on whether Chile should continue to be ruled by General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power about 15 years earlier, voting “no” was voting “yes” to democracy.But if, as Jaar sings, “The yes is in everything,” the idea is that we don’t need to see the future to know that nothing ever really changes, that the cycle continues whether you vote for democracy or not. In turn, it suggests that the statue under discussion between little Nico and Alfredo, (whose own complicated politics are worth noting) could very well have been of Salvador Allende, who Pinochet ousted. There are plenty of extraordinary references on Sirens that I’m sure I missed. But, as with the Essential Mix, as with any collage, being ignorant of any of these things hardly lessens the weight of the music. What you pick up from the album is a real suspicion of power, from “The Governor” (“All the blood’s hidden in the governor’s trunk”) to “Killing Time” (“Money, it seems, needs its working class.”) And at the same time, Nico, through the music, exercises his own power, pulling on his listeners and compelling them to move, dance, think, and engage with one another, or sometimes to sit silently and take it all in.Nico's aversion to authority reaches a climax with that last track, “History Lesson,” which ends with those 45 transcendent seconds that I’m still failing to put into words. “History Lesson” takes its cues from old soul and doo-wop, like the Beach Boys at their most psychedelic. Think “Feel Flows” and those unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul.The music on “History Lesson” is almost laughably gentle at first, and Jaar employs a trick favored by both John Lennon (“Run for Your Life”) and Paul McCartney (“Maxwell’s Silver Hammer”), juxtaposing inviting music with disturbing lyrics. Here’s how his history lesson starts: “Chapter one: We fucked up\\/Chapter two: We did it again, and again, and again, and again\\/Chapter three: We didn’t say sorry.” And so on. The words are a harsh rebuke of any political system. But the music is tender. And the track is bleak and funny, and naïve and wise, and political and personal. It feels like everything all at once. It feels like Sirens.\"],[22426,\"There’s a difference between sleepy-eyed music and music that just puts you to sleep. If Warpaint have made a career out of walking the fine line between the two, your enjoyment of the band naturally depends on which side of that line you see them. Does the L.A. quartet’s anesthetizing approach to downtempo rock create tension out of restraint or does it simply lack enough friction to generate heat? Heads Up, the band’s third full-length, probably won’t change whatever opinion you already have.When we last heard from Warpaint on their 2014 self-titled album, they were tucking the cerebral distance of post-rock into tight pop songs. But if that album staked out a middle ground between, say Tortoise and Broken Bells, Heads Up leans more heavily in a pop direction, veering ever closer to the tuneful but overly polite hum of acts like Coldplay. Warpaint have recently name-dropped Q-Tip, Erykah Badu, OutKast, and Kendrick Lamar as influences on this new material. But the album as a whole is more suited for seated, solitary brooding than for anything as lively as moving your body. When Heads Up does increase its heart rate slightly, as on “New Song,” the band actually loses power with a vanilla hook, couched in a typical modern production sheen that has “sync opportunity” stamped all over it. Mood-wise, Warpaint have essentially remained in the same gear since day one. But Warpaint can slyly rope you in when guitarist\\/vocalists Emily Kokal and Theresa Wayman drop lyrical hints about romantic malaise. Kokal and Wayman express vague indignation without quite lowering their guard enough to come out and tell you how hurt they feel. As such, they rely on the listener’s sense of intuition and empathy to do the work in filling in the blanks, which has a certain effectiveness. You can’t help but apply Warpaint’s elliptical lyrics to your own most recent memories of relational disengagement. The cloudy musical atmospheres that have become their trademark allow the words to attach themselves to a range of sensations from sullen to wistful to yearning. And as much as Warpaint’s songs often address dark figures with questionable intentions, the music never adopts a defeated or victimized posture. That said, do verses like “Did you come undone?\\/Did you become someone unknown?” or “I will not be defined\\/Don’t wanna define myself” give us enough to put ourselves into the shoes of the characters in these songs? Or do they function more as stage lighting without any real action unfolding onstage? Adapting the meaning of music to fit one’s own feelings has its rewards, but it begins to feel cheap when the songs don’t necessarily push you to care about the people in them. “Can’t you tell me all your secrets?\\/I’ll tell you mine” goes a verse on “So Good.” At this point, though, after enticing listeners to lean in closer for a glimpse at those secrets, we might have to question whether Warpaint have any to tell. \"],[22424,\"The science fiction writer Samuel R. Delany wrote that the raison d'être of the genre was not about creating an imagined future, but to consider a world in which art can provide “a significant distortion of the present.” To travel through time, to be plopped out on the other end of a wormhole was to excavate the present moment and remix the past. For the Afrofuturist music critic Kodwo Eshun, this thinking was essential. The art of the Afrodiaspora, from Du Bois’ double consciousness to Sun Ra’s extraterrestrial imagination, was united by a desire to create contexts “that encourage a process of disalienation,” by reconsidering what was possible in the present. Camae Ayewa (a.k.a. Moor Mother) follows in the footsteps of these radical time travelers. Her latest LP Fetish Bones, is a discombobulating journey from the 19th century to the end of the world—through government-sponsored racism, redlining, and the carceral state, revisiting every single wrongful slaying from Emmett Till to Sandra Bland. It’s music that implicates, reveals culpabilities, and creates a space to learn from its inherent difficulty. Ayewa is a Philadelphia-based artist and community activist who has been a fixture in the city for over a decade. Moor Mother began in 2012 as a solo project, and under the moniker she’s released dozens of EPs on Bandcamp, recasting the protest song as a moving electronic collage. According to her own description of the music, it falls within “blk girl blues” and “project housing bop” to “slaveship punk.” These self-made categories allow Ayewa’s music to be fluid in terms of expression, yet consistently grounded in a sense of history. It is very much influenced by the idiosyncrasies and formal experimentation of Sun Ra, but also aligned with the chaotic joy of Shabazz Palaces. Her music is without a doubt confrontational, it often asks you to not only suspend your disbelief, but open yourself up to punishment as well. Fetish Bones is her masterclass on creating a sensory experience that interrogates your complicity, pushing you through a door that sends you hurtling through time.The opener “Creation Myth,” is an astonishing stand-alone musical experience. The way Ayewa arranges sounds reflects a non-hierarchical kind of thinking. Dissonant textures are forced to work in tandem, creating a strange but discomforting beauty. The opening seconds find an electronic warble resembling a tractor beam sharing space with serene flutes, a whispered poem, and a percussive pitter-patter. If you pay attention to the whispered voice beneath the noise, the content of the nearly inaudible words becomes chilling: “Four out of five every day a slaying\\/Two black girls hanging\\/Three black men choking\\/Gun to your face when you praying\\/Or get lynch in ya cell for changing lanes.” When Ayewa enters the scene, digital noise starts to coalesce at the song’s center, and she begins reciting for the next four minutes a harrowing poem that tries to get a handle on the black experience at a nearly molecular level: “Your DNA, the processes of your chromosomes, systematically forming to prevent one's own annihilation.” The narrator of Ayewa’s poem reconstructs the feeling of racing through history by revisiting moments of historical trauma: “The idea is to travel throughout the race riots from 1866 to the present time...I’ve been bleeding since 1866\\/Dragged my bloody self to 1919\\/And bled thru the summer being slaughtered by whites.” The writing here is allusive and surrealist but powerfully direct in its effect. It’s a piece that could be endlessly analyzed: The mixture of words and sounds evoke the visceral intimacy of shared trauma, and it turns a history of abstract suffering into a close-proximity experience.This is not to say the other 12 tracks are slouches. The album is made up of a series of noise poems, mostly just over two minutes long, wherein Ayewa crafts remarkably dense stories. Take “Deadbeat Protest,” which resembles a Death Grips song in its frenetic pace and howling flow. “Trying to save my black life by fetishizing my dead life” Ayewa gasps, making clear the pitfalls of self-centered allyship. In other moments, like in “KBGK,” she looks at how not only the government but capitalism has not only failed the black community but commodified them: “No use for crying\\/They catalog buying\\/And everything for sale\\/Even ya swag in ya public housing.” To live in this album is to be escorted from the past, to present, to future in thirty-second chunks. It happens in part by Ayewa’s woozy selection of both futuristic and anachronistic sounds: needling synths interact with saxophones and grainy sermons in dizzying fashion. This is most evident in “Chain Gang Quantum Blues,” a dazzling and temporally unmoored collage made from the recordings of a chain gang singing through static dissonance. In moments like these, where found sound is heavily processed and queered, the album showcases a frank and unsparing documentarian touch. Ayewa’s great skill is to make the evidence of the past even more uncomfortable, somehow even more present. The last words you hear on the album in “Time Float” are: “Use my dead body as a raft to survive the flooding that’s coming.” In a sentence, she compacts an entire economy of images and events and fears into a single imagined event. Yet in Ayewa’s delivery, it is not brutally sad or even wistful, it is a reminder of the hardships of love under the regime of historical trauma. In those last words there is a sense of sacrifice and duty to the community, that at the end, even under duress, someone is there. It embodies the experience of the album: You will never be able to unhear Fetish Bones because it will have made you a witness.  \"],[22315,\"As the band that convinced Nirvana to sign to DGC Records, Sonic Youth were one of the immediate beneficiaries of Nevermind’s game-changing success. They may not have received an official finder’s fee, but the spillover spoils were undeniable: heavier MTV rotation, six-figure record sales, and enough Letterman appearances to usurp Paul Shaffer as the house band. But, at the same time, Sonic Youth’s talent-scout acumen wasn’t just a boon to the DGC A&R department. In 1992, drummer Steve Shelley launched his own imprint out of his Hoboken home to nurture the next sedimentary layer of the underground. With tongue planted somewhat in cheek, he gave his label a name—Smells Like Records—that honored the very phenomenon that allowed him to wield his kingmaking powers.But if the Smells Like name was a bit of a joke, then Blonde Redhead seemed to be the punchline, given that their music exuded a pungent whiff of Shelley’s main gig. If Sonic Youth had come to view Nirvana as their baby band, Blonde Redhead were the NYC-bound foreign-exchange students—two Japanese women and a pair of Italian twins—who had their own peculiar interpretation of the host culture. Revisiting the two albums Blonde Redhead released on Smells Like, it’s easy to hear why Shelley was drawn to the band—and the reasons go beyond imitation-as-flattery. Where Nirvana showed how Sonic Youth’s sturm-and-clang could be streamlined for mainstream rock audiences, Blonde Redhead made it seem oblique and exotic once again, rendering post-no-wave squall with a European art-house sophistication.  Masculin Féminin compiles Blonde Redhead’s Smells Like catalogue—1994’s self-titled debut and 1995’s La Mia Vita Violenta—along with associated singles, outtakes, and radio sessions. And the box set arrives via Numero Group, a reissue label best known for its archival digs through regional ’70s soul scenes from Ohio to Belize. But these days, the ’90s New York indie rock era feels equally remote. The Big Apple sounds of the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s have been thoroughly canonized in books, documentaries, fictional biopics, and ill-fated TV shows. But while contemporary music—from indie rock to R&B—is now awash in ’90s nostalgia, the trend has mostly passed over the vibrant activity happening in New York at the time. Through the 1980s, indie rock was built on American infrastructure: interstates and college towns and community-radio stations and Kinko’s. But by the mid-’90s, it had become something more cosmopolitan, and New York, naturally, served as the primary melting pot. The Beastie Boys were its most eager ambassadors, with a multi-cultural messthetic that filtered down to peers like Luscious Jackson, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Soul Coughing, and Cibo Matto, while their Grand Royal magazine packed a whole internet’s worth of global esoterica into its handsomely bound pages. At the same time, Matador Records were less interested in looking for the next Pavement than scooping up Japanese pastiche-pop acts like Pizzicato Five and Cornelius.  Blonde Redhead weren’t as outwardly irreverent as the aforementioned artists—after all, they took their name from a song by no-wave iconoclasts DNA. And their standard four-piece rock-band lineup seemed traditional compared to the prevailing genre-hopping cut-and-paste style. But even on their 1995 debut, they were severing the abrasive sound of indie rock from its hardcore roots and refashioning it into something more impressionistic and enigmatic.In discussing the band’s early years with the Big Takeover in 2011, singer Kazu Makino said, “I never thought we were violent or angry or post punk.” But you might get a different impression from their debut’s caterwauling opener “I Don’t Want U,” a he-scream\\/she-scream anti-love song scrawled with a bloody razor blade. While the deceptively calm mise-en-scène bears evidence of brothers Simone and Amedeo Pace’s jazz-schooled backgrounds, it’s soon vandalized by the former’s strangulated verse vocals and a frenzied climax where Makino unleashes a voice like a squawking saxophone.  The rest of Blonde Redhead is likewise built from serrated shards and sudden expulsions, with Kazu and Simone prodding and jousting one another in an attempt to figure out how their voices can interlock. There are touches of the melodic finesse that would flourish on later releases, but on songs like “Mama Cita” and “Astro Boy,” the staccato, circular singing often mirrors the needling guitar lines. Tellingly, the album’s most transfixing song is its most atypical, both in the context of this record and everything Blonde Redhead did after. On the eerily propulsive “Sciuri Sciura,” Kazu’s funhouse-mirrored voice refracts atop a hypnotic bass groove from long departed bassist Maki Takahashi (who only stuck around for this one album).Given the lushness of their post-millennium output, the stern-faced severity of Blonde Redhead seems even more jarring today than it did in ’95. But the singles and outtakes compiled here hint at a more gentle, playful side: “Big Song” bears the shoegazing glide of late-’80s My Bloody Valentine; “Vague” is a stab at hooky, Pixies-esque fuzz-pop. And it’s funny how much Blonde Redhead’s most radical attempts to draw outside the lines mirror Sonic Youth’s efforts at the same. In the drum-machined scuzz-hop experiments “This Is the Number of Times I Said I Will But Didn’t” and “Woody,” Blonde Redhead essentially adopt their own Ciccone Youth alter ego, right down to the latter track’s “Lucky Star” references. But while 29-second drum-loop snippet “Slogan Attempt” initially seems like a superfluous throwaway, its brief quote of Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin’s “La Décadanse” drops the tiniest bread-crumb clue pointing to the band’s future.La Mia Vita Violenta yielded the first real evidence of Blonde Redhead’s art-pop aspirations—the guitars still buzz and drone, but the hooks are sharper, the bee-swarm onslaught more focussed. The difference is immediately apparent on the album’s exhilarating opener “(I Am Taking Out My Eurotrash) I Still Get My Rocks Off,” where Kazu’s restless verses and Simone’s melodic counter-vocal provide a perfect balance of tension and release. On the whole, the two singers sound more complementary than combative, with the soothing influence of ’60s Franco-pop loosening up the discordant tangle of songs like “Bean” and non-album A-side “Flying Douglas.” And with “Violent Life,” Simone tapped into the perpetually yearning singing style that would become his signature.The seams are still showing here: the cool maraca rhythm of “U.F.O.” abruptly gives way to a thundering drum coda that you wish the band had explored further. And the record’s transitory nature sees distorto-pop blurts like “I Am There While You Choke on Me” and “10 Feet High” collide with the clock-melting sitar odyssey “Harmony” (also presented here in its shorter, more unsettled seven-inch version) and the creepily whispered lullaby “Jewel.” The outtakes here venture even further afield, with tentative toe-dips into sad-eyed electro-pop (“Not Too Late”) and lonesome-cowboy blues (“Country Song”). But that unorthodox approach is what liberates this music from the realm of ’90s time capsules. Taken as a whole, Masculin Féminin is a scrapbook made of records that already felt like scrapbooks, but collectively they form a portrait of a band more multi-dimensional than their Sonic Youth Jr. rep suggested. Listening now, the differences between the two bands seem as pronounced as the similarities. Compared to Sonic Youth’s tightly coiled art-punk epics, early Blonde Redhead were far more scrappy and impulsive, and they were more willing to exploit the frisson between their male and female leads (compared to Thurston and Kim’s often segregated vocal turns). And when you consider the kind of music Sonic Youth were making at the time and thereafter, it’s not a stretch to suggest the influence was mutual.Blonde Redhead recorded La Mia Vita Violenta around the same time Sonic Youth were finishing up Washing Machine, and the records share a disquieting nocturnal atmosphere infused with ghostly echoes of pre-psychedelic pop. In hindsight, both albums were also situated at the same crossroads: La Mia Vita Violenta saw Blonde Redhead starting to shed their scabrous skin en route to a more expansive sound, while Washing Machine served as Sonic Youth’s gateway from their Lollapalooza-headliner halcyon days into their more experimental SYR EPs phase. And where Sonic Youth once fixated on American icons from Madonna to Manson, from this point on, they started giving songs titles like “Contre le Sexisme” and “Slaapkamers Met Slagroom,” while packaging records to look like European library music. It’s hard to say if Blonde Redhead were responsible for stoking the Youth’s internationalist affectations. But the great strides they made on La Mia Vita Violenta at least instilled Blonde Redhead with enough confidence to title their next record Fake Can Be Just As Good.\"],[22431,\"Love has been the benzine in pop music’s tank since time immemorial. That’s because trying to pin down its meaning is like trying to crescent kick a waterfall—it is constantly being filtered and refiltered through a pop culture prism. Everyone from Walt Disney, to Ian Curtis, to André 3000 had their own takes. Yet here we are, in 2016, and Chicago rapper Mick Jenkins has released a concept album about love that finds fresh angles.The cover to The Healing Component features the heart as it beats in the human chest. The organ is exposed, precious, vital—only ever a beat away from the end of a life. Jenkins’ album arrives in the backdrop of the shooting death of Terence Crutcher at the hands of police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Not to mention black men and children killed in Ferguson, Cleveland, New York, Minnesota, and Baton Rouge. The rapper might preach love throughout—“Spread love, try to combat the sadness,” he demands on the title track—but he sounds like an optimist desperately reaching for the broken shards tearing away from his soul. This might be one of year’s best blues albums.Jenkins broadly pitches love as humanity’s “healing component” as taught to him through scripture. “That’s what Jesus was down here to show us,” he tells an anonymous friend on one of the record’s segues. Inevitably, a record this much into religion will be stacked next to fellow Chi-Town lyricist Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book. But while Chancelor’s record came with a wave of saintly Christian sentiment, Jenkins engages with faith as a weapon to scorch America’s white patriarchy.“How could a black man not be confused in this?\\/Used to hang by those trees, we abusing them now?” Jenkins asks on “Strange Love,” a slam poetry scrapbook of scattered thoughts. He’s long used water as a metaphor for knowledge (see 2014 mixtape The Water[s], in particular) but on “Drowning,” it takes on a more sinister tone: “When the real hold you down, you supposed to drown right?\\/Wait, wait, that don’t sound right.” The death of Eric Garner haunts the track further with chants of “I can’t breathe” as BADBADNOTGOOD’s down ‘n’ dirty instrumentation sounds like a funeral procession. Police brutality, institutionalized racism, and the disrespectful pilfering of black culture are all covered in Jenkins’ pad of rhymes. This is protest rap whose punches come from odd angles but still land the with the weight of a sledgehammer.The Healing Component is a verbose album, like it’s caught the emcee on a savage trip through the corridors of his mind. Jenkins might drop Bible references, but his scriptures have been dipped in enough drugs to take down Hunter S. Thompson. On the spaced-out “100 Xans,” he admits to “tweaking and laughing ‘til I hurt ribs.”  The instrumentation, too, snaps with an acid-soaked psychedelia. “Strange Love” is all midnight-blue swagger, slinking forward with its cosmic keys and slide guitars. “Communicate,” produced by Kaytranada, is the closest thing the record has to a radio jam. It’s a head-down groove under the flickering strobe lights of a neon-tinted basement club after last orders—the only song where a line like, “Want to call you bae and I don’t mean San Francisco” could work.Jenkins’ previous EP, the bouncy Wave[s], plays like the rapper burning off the lighter tracks in his chamber—the stuff that thematically falls outside this album’s concept. The Healing Component would have benefitted for a couple of those brighter moments to keep things moving, but it’s a small gripe. This socially-scathing, Alprazolam-laced, Jesus piece-baring work slices like a knife. He can’t successfully pin down the nuances of love over 62 minutes, but he spits plenty of good bars.\"],[22443,\"This election season has been dystopian enough to force YG into touring the country with a Trump piñata. Now the Compton rapper’s day-one bro and producer Ty Dolla $ign—an artist not usually known for his politics on anything beyond “these hoes”—offers his own pro-Clinton statement in a new mixtape, Campaign. In its skits, distorted vocals argue in favor of voting as damage control. “She gotta fix these jail policies and everything…but…If all votes count, I’m voting for Hillary. Fuck it,” an uncredited YG declares at the end of “Hello.”Despite the PSAs, Campaign doesn’t represent a major overhaul of Ty Dolla $ign’s talking points—or the L.A. singer\\/songwriter\\/producer’s sound, for that matter. Tracks like “Zaddy” represent the comfort zone of the mixtape: mid-tempo, trap- and hyphy-inflected tunes about responding to booty calls while faded on pills. While Ty’s debut studio album from last year, Free TC, was overrun with enormously catchy, even pestilential hooks, Campaign’s sordid refrains are more of the first-thought-best-thought variety.Still, Campaign’s most acerbic songs are rewarding after an acclimation period; Ty remains obsessed with bending grating and unlikely sounds to his will, as he has been since his breakout days. The Travis-Scott-featuring “3 Wayz” features some of the most oddly detailed synth layering you’ll hear in hip-hop this year against a backfiring electronic drum loop that never quite springs into action. Much like TC’s Hot 100 hit “Blase,” it scans like a flair-less dirge on first listen but gradually takes on a creeping, narcotic appeal.Elsewhere, against all odds, Ty continues to sell unlikely pop\\/R&B Jack Johnson posturing, as he perfected on TC’s lascivious, Tish Hyman-penned guitar ballad “Horses in the Stable” (“That I-I can ride\\/Anytime”). On “Campaign,” he makes a garden-variety Future hook—a retread of his “wicked, wicked, wicked” cadence—shine by juxtaposing even more prurient interruptions. And, most notably, as he did on the TC highlight “Miracle \\/ Whenever,” Ty arranges an a cappella track by his brother TC, who is incarcerated on a life sentence: “No Justice” hits hard, a testimonial to the long-term effects of police discrimination.It’s nice to see Ty continue to complicate the Mustard-wave script, but also rewarding to revisit the elements that made those songs—even with their collar-tuggingly softcore content—undeniable in the first place. Coming in Campaign’s third act, “Pu$$y” has the satisfying quality of a desperate, last-call room service order. It incorporates all the key ingredients of the original, wiry, subs-busting Dolla\\/Mustard\\/YG-originated recipe, with an expected vintage of chorus: “At the end of the day, it’s still my pussy, my pussy, my pussy...” (ad infinitum). Performing his most impressive trick, Ty somehow gets the temperature just right for his frequent collaborator and label head Wiz Khalifa to be bearable—even welcome—in his cameo.By 2016, pop’s biggest names are no longer hesitating to acknowledge their underground benefactors: Ty is getting features on Top 10 singles as well as songwriting checks. This gives him leverage; Ty is clearly making the music he wants to make, even if the stakes for it remain low. (Free TC debuted to little fanfare at No. 14 on the Billboard Top 200.) Campaign outpaces his recent efforts like $ign Language and Airplane Mode but, still, mostly just preserve Ty’s musical bottom line. At moments, its political truisms seem to reflect back on that persistence: “It get hard for all of us, but we campaign,” he murmurs on the intro. “It’s easy to quit, or say no, turn the other cheek…nah, we campaignin’ though.”\"],[22432,\"At some point, for Jenn Wasner, all the praise she attracted as a guitarist began to grow complicated. “It felt so strange to have the focus shift from my songs and ideas to my guitar playing,” the Wye Oak leader shared in an essay this summer. “‘This chick shreds!’ ‘Hey, you can really play!’” Wasner saw how her own guitar work was often cast as a spectacle, in contrast to her equally talented male bandmates. “No one draws any additional attention to them — it is taken in stride,” Wasner wrote. “Meanwhile, time and time again, you are fawned over like a child who’s just taken her first steps.”It’s no wonder, then, why Wasner took a trial separation from the guitar with Wye Oak’s 2014 Shriek—though it only served to reinforce how integral the instrument was to the band’s identity. That record fit a pattern of extremes: Wye Oak’s 2011 breakthrough Civilian was guitar-rock; Shriek was their synthesized reinvention; and the one-off LP from Wasner’s side-project Dungeonesse was an exercise in Mariah Carey-worshipping pop. In contrast to those albums, each built around clear or implicit parameters, her debut LP as Flock of Dimes, If You See Me, Say Yes, is simply a Jenn Wasner record. It’s the most all-encompassing showing of her tastes yet, representing in equal measure guitars and synths, dreamy indie rock and digital pop. Along with Wye Oak’s Tween, a collection of outtakes released earlier this year, it’s proof that Wasner does her best work when she doesn’t impose restraints on herself.  Wasner has adjusted her vision for Flock of Dimes since its early singles. She began the project as a channel for beat-heavy experiments that didn’t fit under the Wye Oak umbrella, but as that band grew increasingly synth-minded itself, Flock of Dimes became more straightforward, an outlet for her most revealing songs. It’s a meaningful evolution for a songwriter who once thrived on obfuscation. An air of secrecy hung over Wye Oak’s best records, a haze that rendered key sentiments cryptic. Even the consonant-swallowing slur in Wasner’s voice seemed like a form of omission.But her songs on If You See Me are bright and open, documenting with clear prose new beginnings, the passage of time, and—poetically for an album she mostly recorded alone—the hermetic tendencies that keep her at a distance from even the closest people in her life. On the rippling “Given\\/Electric Life,” Wasner admits that she’s “Afraid to be seen as I see myself\\/Even more to be seen as I really am” and resorts to counting down the days. And as if summoning the more approachable, carefree person she longs to be, the music is deliberately outgoing. The radiant “Everything Is Happening Today” looks to the extroverted thump of her neighbors and labelmates Sylvan Esso, while “Ida Glow” corrals its Gary Numan-esque synths around a pumping disco-house beat. Even “You, the Vatican,” a Wye Oak-sounding number about the most Wye Oak of subjects—death—is delivered with reassuring warmth.On an album like Civilian or Shriek, that song might have chilled to the bone, with guitars either severely squalling or eerily absent. But here Wasner’s guitars amble amicably alongside her, refracting light over her songs without upstaging or overwhelming them. There’s never the slightest threat they’ll erupt into a blistering solo, the way they so often used to. As awesome as those solos always were, they’re barely missed here. If You See Me may lack some of the tension and menace of Wye Oak’s best records, but that’s a fair tradeoff for an album this personable and at peace with itself.\"],[22427,\"The release of New York indie rock quartet LVL UP’s latest album Return to Love hinged on an ultimatum. After years toiling as linchpins in the city’s DIY scene, playing in a half dozen other scummy pop acts, and with half of the band running the small but influential label Double Double Whammy, they decided that they'd had enough. The rock project that Dave Benton and Mike Caridi launched with their college buds—drummer Greg Rutkin and bassist\\/singer Nick Corbo—would either have to get good enough to draw the attention of a bigger indie label (“Sub Pop, Merge, or Matador,” they said in a recent interview) or call it quits entirely.As chance would have it, some Sub Pop employees caught a couple shows in the wake of the band’s cult-beloved 2014 record Hoodwink’d and decided to release their new album Return to Love. But happy endings aside, it’s hard not to read that do-or-die period into the relatable agitation of this record. For the first time, the trio of songwriters’ lyrics largely deal with existential turmoils rather than interpersonal ones. It’s as if the possibility of the band ending—or maybe just getting older—forced them to stop and think about bigger themes, to look at the sky and anxiously sputter what they see.On album opener “Hidden Driver,” Benton meditates on the Biblical fall of man and the nature of God. Corbo considers the meaning of life while telling a creation myth of sorts on the closer “Naked in the River With the Creator.” Caridi processes a loved one’s trauma on “Pain” and offers the line, “I hope you grow old\\/And never find love” as both a withering send-off and a crippling suggestion that under the circumstances, nothing you can say will ever be enough. These are mammoth questions, the sorts of things that theologians, philosophers, and ethicists spend their whole lives puzzling over. And the decision to confront them, especially without offering easy answers, gives Return to Love a weight that past LVL UP efforts lacked. The record’s also pushed forward by their three-songwriter lineup. Though their voices are sometimes hard to distinguish—particularly Corbo’s throaty mumble and Benton’s pinched moan—there’s a change in spirit between each one that lends a delightfully erratic energy to the whole effort. On the record’s B-side, Benton opens with the plodding “The Closing Door” before sulking through two of Corbo’s observational downers and then rapidly ratches the energy back up on Caridi’s “I,” which is as perilously caffeinated as anything in Royal Headache’s catalog. Hoodwink’d was a bit more unified both in tempo and tone, but the unhinged style works in favor of these songs. They’re singing about uncomfortable questions, it’s only fitting that the music should follow. The general shape of Return to Love is familiar. Like the band’s earliest albums, it’s largely a guitar, bass, and drums-driven rock record that mines its song structures from the gold soundz of ’90s indie rock and their peers in the contemporary Northeastern indie rock scene. Even this agitated and disjointed album of existential bummer jams that follows a beloved pop album has precedents—think Dinosaur Jr.’s paranoid Bug after You’re Living All Over Me or Pavement’s Wowee Zowee after Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. But that’s part of what makes Return to Love so comforting, so satisfyingly unsatisfied. There’s a sense of possibility in the desperation. They’re just the latest to move these pieces around—to use distortion pedals and droning vocals to unpack the mysteries of the universe. But there’s a confidence that with time they could be the ones to finally solve the puzzle.\"],[22423,\"The cornerstone of Devendra Banhart’s career was an album called Cripple Crow. Released in 2005, the 22-track record presented Banhart as an artist brimming with ideas, surrounded by friends, and firmly at the center of a movement that was beginning to gain traction outside his indie bubble. Since then, Banhart’s career has been characterized by less momentous events: a DOA major label debut, some forgettable collaborations, a few art books. Especially considering his newfound penchant for breezy, non-confrontational pop music, in 2016, it’s hard to imagine Banhart being at the forefront of anything. While the artists he came up with have been striking career-bests through dramatic reinvention and childhood psychoanalysis, Banhart seems mostly content to plink away at his keyboard and entertain himself.On the whole, Ape in Pink Marble, his ninth album, doesn’t sound much different than Mala, his solid 2013 release. Teaming again with that album’s collaborators, Noah Georgeson and Josiah Steinbrick, Ape shares Mala’s wispy, low-stakes coziness. Despite the chilled-out atmosphere, however, Ape is a much darker listen, and its best moments are a reminder of why Banhart touched a nerve in the first place. Opener “Middle Names” laments the loss of a close friend over a chord progression not far from Dan Bejar’s “Chinatown.” The following “Good Time Charlie” is even better, tying a burbling folk melody to a weirdly touching narrative about a police officer. “Sometimes I breathalyze\\/And he gives the DUIs,” Banhart swoons before subverting the romance with a haunting question: “Is it love or just blood in his eyes?” With their gentle, psychedelic guitars and lilting vocals, these opening tracks come as close to Banhart’s sweet spot as he has since he first ventured out of it a decade back.Around the time of his last album in 2013, Banhart addressed a common criticism of his recent music: “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had a friend [say], in this tender and discreet voice, ‘It’s just you and me bro, and I want to tell you the truth: make a record of you and an acoustic guitar. Please.’” Despite his self-awareness and the intimate strength of the opening tracks, Ape is not the return-to-form his friends have been pushing for. It’s dragged down by the same aimlessness that’s affected most of Banhart’s releases. Things get particularly dire in the middle stretch, with a pair of goofy tracks—“Fancy Man” and “Fig in Leather”—that are at once grating enough to disrupt the flow of the album and still anonymous enough to soundtrack a Chipotle. Even Banhart’s best albums had their share of jokey self-indulgence (let’s not forget that the “real good time” Banhart promised to have in 2004’s “This Beard Is for Siobhan” was just between him and a false set of teeth), but these songs represent the nadir of his recorded output.After those missteps, the album’s second half plays it fairly straight. Heavy on ballads and low on energy, Banhart sometimes comes in danger of scrubbing away any remnants of his once-magnetic personality. Occasionally, though, Ape approaches sparse brilliance. “Mourners’ Dance” is simple but effective, with a calming synth-and-vocals atmosphere that justifies Banhart’s Morrison-esque “raise the dead” intonations. Early single “Saturday Night” is the closest this album comes to a straight-up radio pop song—something that Banhart’s had his eye on ever since 2009’s “Baby”—and, with a dusky, OVO moodiness, it makes for one of the record’s finest moments.Ape closes with a pair of languid, burnt ballads, almost forcing the listener to drift out of focus. These tracks, however, are not entirely without charm. “Lucky” might seem like a plain admission of admiration, with its lovesick chorus and soulful guitars, but deeper listens reveal it to be more like a sigh of relief at the end of a troubled relationship, a quiet acceptance that the flame is gone. “Baby I can see the sun is setting in your eyes,” he sings as guitars twinkle around him, “Another reason why I’m lucky.” There’s a sense of freedom in his voice, hinting at a clean break from the past and a move toward more comfortable, if less inspired, territory. It just goes to show that Banhart might be more in control than we think, even when it seems like he’s barely there.\"],[22387,\"Let’s bow our heads for the phrase “going pop,” a now-archaic term meant to note an underground artist compromising themselves to make gobs of money and perch themselves on top of the charts. “Gobs of money” no longer applies to industry hopefuls, in a splintered post-monoculture there’s nobody to compromise to, and with postmodern retromaniacal flailing still a top priority, anything that might otherwise skew “trendy” still sounds like a future that’s dragging its ass on actually getting here. Travis Stewart’s had one of the more typical internet-era careers in that context: as Machinedrum, he spent nearly ten years being underrated for working in the margins of glitch-hop, then was pulled into the post-dubstep orbit to find a cult audience that felt bigger than it actually was. He went on to find equal renown (and more resilient praise) in a team-up with Praveen Sharma as Sepalcure. And then, because this is what happens now, he started putting out the amount of work one typically needs to do to support himself, only to find out that people expect you to keep reinventing yourself, which, whoops.But maybe what passes for “going pop” now is the very thing that’s actually snapped Machinedrum’s style into sharper focus. And it all clicks once you hear how geeked about contemporary R&B and dance music Human Energy is. This is the record where the guest features start pouring in, the scattered and shattered sampled-vocal loops receding in favor of live voices. There’s also some personal-life conceptual thinking about Stewart’s New Age holistic healing and meditation that went into this somewhere, and you can hear some signs of spiritually renewed energy in the music if you listen close enough. However, that could just be the arpeggios lining up in just the right sequence to hit that emotional\\/physical connection in that super crowd-pleasing way. Those guest voices mesh well with Machinedrum’s enlightenment through repetition, bringing a bit more flexibility and unpredictability than your traditional diva loop. The neo-junglist rhythms of “Do It 4 U” might not sound as fresh as they did in 2011, but all it takes is Dawn Richard’s voice descending from the clouds to reintroduce the hazy uplift that makes the best of this stuff breathe. Like her best work with the similarly future-bass-inclined Kingdom, D∆WN’s voice gets pretty altered here—rebuilt into staccato waviness, flanged, and muffled—only to have it resonate high above the chattering melodies and give the track a weight before its weightlessness burns it up in the atmosphere. And both MeLo-X (growling “let the trumpets hit”-declarations on the Diplo-one-upping, dancehall-in-space anthem “Angel Speak”) and Jesse Boykins III (finding bliss in the crystalline glitch-soul cut “Celestial Levels”), earn the gravity they give to tracks that approach the boundaries of feel-too-happy euphoria. There’s never been a sense in Machinedrum’s work, especially from Room(s) onwards, that this music is just a basic distillation of trends. I’m grateful that the drive-thru speaker fidelity and impenetrable wall of pre-drop clap buildups on “Dos Puertas” at least partially muffles Kevin Hussein’s disconnected art-but-not rap. But Stewart sounds renewed in channeling his posi-vibe mindstate into making the rest of his instruments soar. The glassy bells on “Morphogen” and the ’87 mall-pop distortions of “Isometrix” capture the idealized yet unfamiliar retro vibe that eludes most vaporwave composers, and he commands his dynamics to sequence a pixellated sugar rush (“White Crown”) right before an isolation-tank meditation (“Ocean of Thought”). Even the interlude-length sketches—the breathtaking “Lapis,” the organ-driven trance of “Etheric Body Temple,” the Boards of Canada-in-a-pastel-palm-tree-t-shirt zone-out of “Surfed Out”—fill in the blanks that the threats of diminishing returns left open. Maybe this is the album where Machinedrum breaks big. If it is, there’s even less to the glitch\\/pop divide than we ever suspected.\"],[22146,\"On May 17, 2015, Lionel Pickens, known as the Coke Boys rapper Chinx (or Chinx Drugz), was killed in a drive-by shooting while sitting behind the wheel of his Porsche in Queens. Chinx was a street savvy rapper with solid pop instincts and singsong sensibilities (not unlike his label boss French Montana) who was cut down just as he’d begun to blossom. His posthumous debut album, Welcome to JFK, was a reflection of his promise, and served as both a finely-curated introduction and a proper send-off. JFK was a swan song capped by the closer “Die Young” with the powerful and prescient final bar “I pray I be okay when I grow up a little bigger\\/If I don’t, tell my babies daddy was a real nigga.” As endnotes go, it doesn’t get more fitting than that. So releasing another record postmortem, with a myth-building title like Legends Never Die, feels suspiciously like a branding play, less concerned with eulogizing Chinx’s art and instead setting its sights on his legacy. In its rush to glory, Legends Never Die becomes the one thing a legacy album can’t be: forgettable.When remembering Chinx’s brief career, listeners should refer to his Cocaine Riot mixtape series, which fully captured his bellowed melodies and joyous dope dealer romps without the stakes. In an attempting to build an obelisk out of scraps, the stakes are simply too high on Legends Never Die and these hard-drive cloggers couldn’t hope to live up to them. The songs are all clearly outtakes from the same cobbled together sessions and recordings that birthed Welcome to JFK—it has the same cast of producers (Blickie Blaze, Young Stokes, Lee on the Beats, Austin Powerz, and Remo the Hitmaker) and many of the same guests (Montana, Meet Sims, and another verse from the late Stack Bundles), only worse execution. The feature verses are bland and the album is poorly sequenced. The middle section is scattered and uneven, sandwiching a grating poacher tune like “Slide Up in Ya Bitch” in between a ballad (“Yeah I Do”) and a ride or die anthem (“Real Bitch”). The album should end with the Montana-assisted “Legendary,” but doesn’t. None of these tracks are among Chinx’s best or even his most fun work, and attempting to use them to cement his legend, ironically, seems shortsighted.Despite missing its mark, Legends Never Die isn’t without purpose—it's still refreshing to hear new Chinx verses and hooks, which are surprisingly earwormy. In a way, the album unfolds as the Book of Chinx, recounting how he lived and died: getting rich selling coke, living a luxurious lifestyle, and trading shots with bitter enemies and jealous rivals. A song like “Around Me,” which applies “fuck nigga” repellant, reads like his mantra and there’s some haunting foreshadowing in lyrics like “Shit a nigga seen, couldn’t live through it\\/Nigga used to stop at the red light\\/Now a nigga dip through it.” (There’s even a bar about coming through the block in a Porsche.) But inside these songs he’s present; he wins, he reflects, he prays, he jokes, he loves, he loots, and he lives. For 50 minutes, Chinx breathes again.When Legends Never Die is working well, it embodies Chinx’s spirit, showing off his versatility in the process. The strobing “For the Love” finds him in full croon, delivering one of his strongest vocal performances of his career with Meet Sims at his back. On “Crown Royal,” he wades into a wave of heavy 808 bass with choppy cadences crowning himself a coke kingpin (“Got the accolades on the corner\\/Dope from Peru, sniff from Tijuana”). “Like This,” which features smooth Chrisette Michele background vocals, is radio ready with plush synth arrangements and a hook that rattles around the brain. He does his cleanest writing on “Match That,” challenging competitors to match his accomplishments and drawing parallels in the same breath. In fits and starts, you can hear the gears turning; Chinx was finding his rhythm and might’ve developed into an astute craftsman given time. Now, all that remains are the drafts he left behind. Legends Never Die won’t preserve his legacy, but it’s another reminder of what could’ve been.\"],[22386,\"There’s a bit of irony in the title of Itasca’s third album, Open to Chance. Musically, this is Kayla Cohen’s most precise, controlled work to date, compared not only to her early abstract drones as Sultan but even to her last full-length, 2015’s beautifully wandering guitar-and-voice record Unmoored by the Wind. It’s also her first recording with a band, which perhaps explains why she kept a tight ship, lest her subtle, intricate folk songs get blurred or drowned by overly-busy accompaniment.Thematically, though, Open to Chance has an apt name. It’s a record about trying something new and journeying into unknown experiences with eager, if cautious, optimism. The album opens with Cohen proposing a move to the mountains with her mate, travels through observations and interpretations of her environs, and closes with a meditation on how this dream might end. That might sound heavy, and certainly Cohen’s music is serious and often melancholy. But there’s a lot of joy in the way her songs illustrate and embody her thoughtful verse.Much of that joy comes from Cohen’s guitar and voice, two finely-tuned instruments that are uniquely adept at conveying her ideas and images. There’s always some spring in her acoustic, finger-picked step, even in Open to Chance’s most reflective moments. Her vocals are more wistful and bittersweet, delivered with a fading restraint that evokes Vashti Bunyan’s best whispers. But she also has a bright lilt that suits her open-eyed musings. When it's applied to lines such as “Wonder if I’ll ever turn this around,” or, “I’m rolling in circles again,” it’s equally possible to hear them as hopeful or downbeat. More likely, it's both at the same time.Open to Chance is also engaging simply because Cohen sounds so fascinated with everything she sees. Her purview is mainly the natural world—trees and flowers, sunsets and breezes, mice and hens— but she’s just as concerned with the nature of people. In one absorbing track, “No Consequence,” she marvels at confident individuals, the kind so assured and charmed that they seem unreal. Cohen views them from every angle, but she’s still suspicious: “You tell me it takes time\\/But I think you’ve got a joker on your side.”Apparently for Cohen, that kind of self-certainty means the death of adventure. She’s more interested in potentials and indeterminacies, and all the different ways that things could go. In that sense, “Just for Tomorrow” is Open to Chance’s most fitting song. Just eight lines long, it's tinged with regret. Cohen sings, “I once held a faithful dream,” perhaps referencing the fantasy that opened the album, and yet she still celebrates the unknown: “After all there are so many ways\\/I might have just walked.” It’s that appreciation of possibility, of the paths ahead and the ones left behind, that makes Open to Chance compelling.\"],[22416,\"Over the course of his last few albums, Tom Krell, the singer behind How to Dress Well, charted a heady course, elevating pop accessibility, R&B crooning, and a dash of electronic experimentation into high art. With his intellectual bona fides established by his never-quite-finished philosophy dissertation and his canny tendency of praising contemporary rappers and 18th century theorists in conversation, Krell was able to brand his viscerally pleasurable music as both “smart” and “cool.” By the time the smoldering, show-stopping “What Is This Heart?” came out in 2014, he had become a poster boy for alternative R&B at a time when critics were not quite as united against the term as they are (I hope) now.Krell’s seeming intelligence, combined with his curiosity and talent, inspired a generosity in his listeners, a willingness to read great meaning into ostensibly simple lyrics. It’s an attitude that you can see play out in the Genius annotations of the single “Repeat Pleasure” from “What Is This Heart?” The song’s first verse ends with the lyric, “Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night.” Here’s the Talmudic interpretation: “Krell plays with the conventional pop love song’s themes of undying love and eternal happiness in love by recognizing the night of love; loneliness.” That statement is not wrong, and its generosity is not misplaced. On the contrary, it demonstrates an attitude that should be extended to more musicians, regardless of how much philosophy they’ve studied. There is a lot going on in the Michael Jackson-aping “Repeat Pleasure,” a single that combines thoughtfulness and danceability in a way that presages many of the better songs on Care, Krell’s new album and his fourth full-length as How to Dress Well. The new record contains plenty of lyrics that seem basic to the point of banality, but which our trust in Krell often allows us to recognize as filled with well-considered ideas about the risks and challenges of love, of one’s self and of others. Take “Can’t You Tell,” the stunner that opens the album. On first listen, it’s nothing more than an enthusiastic sex jam, beginning with the lyrics: “Wanna lay you down and take you right there, take you right there, can’t you tell?” If this were a song by another artist, you might not think twice about the words. But with How to Dress Well we linger, and the lyrics reveal depth: “Take you right there” can be read in two ways, the first passionate and threatening, the other tender and devotional, the two ideas either linked or opposed. And that strange, lingering lyric “can’t you tell?,” signals a kind of plea for connection and consent, emphasized soon afterward when Krell seems to halfway retreat: “Yea I want it,” he enthuses, before insisting, “But I want it when you want it, baby.”As layered as they can be, these ideas about sex (which are ideas about power, attraction, and respect) wouldn't be as rich were it not for the music bolstering them. As on “What Is This Heart?,” Krell’s voice remains front and center throughout most of Care, which he executive produced with help from guitar-pop maestro Jack Antonoff and the dancehall mastermind Dre Skull, as well as the experimental Canadian musicians Kara-Lis Coverdale and Michael Silver (CFCF). Working with a team of diverse collaborators seems to have allowed Krell to indulge his tendency for rich sonic experimentation while making the most direct music of his career.This combination of adventurousness and immediacy yields one particularly extraordinary song. “Salt Song,” the track that directly follows “Can’t You Tell,” is a masterpiece, one of the best songs that Krell has made. Produced by Skull, it’s an immaculately structured, near seven-minute pop odyssey about self-care, happiness, and risk that includes a panoply of musical elements that you’d think would repel each other: mournful cello, a ludicrously self-satisfied whistle encasing the vocal melody and a stormy mosh pit of a coda that will be soundtracking the ecstatic ends of Saturday night parties for months if not years to come. The song accomplishes what the best pop does, disguising its own complexity even as the excitement of its many thrills keeps it interesting after half a hundred listens.Opening as it does with those two songs, as well as the good-but-not-great second single “What’s Up,” Care seems to be carving out territory as a record on par with “What Is This Heart?”, less obviously ambitious but way more fun. And then, Care’s first single, “Lost Youth \\/ Lost You” lands with a dull thud, casting a pall over the rest of the album. The track, produced in part by Antonoff, is almost a full minute shorter than “Salt Song” but it feels infinitely longer with its plodding, faux-insightful chorus about the heart’s confusion and its head-scratching musical decisions; an unearned guitar solo mid-track is made even more miserable when Krell decides to sing over it. It takes a truly empty song to turn a generous listener into a miser, and on Care, “Lost Youth\\/ Lost You” is that song.The track is intended to signify a narrative shift from excitement and lust to heartbreak, but it overplays that transition and derails the album, partly because Care’s back half is significantly spottier than its opening numbers, with several of the elements that hurt “Lost Youth \\/ Lost You” showing up repeatedly. Sly, jokey lyrics suddenly come across as blustering, or obnoxiously self-absorbed, while slow-burners including “Burning Up,” “Made a Lifetime,” and “They’ll Take Everything You Have” feel perfunctory. Either their lyrics genuinely lack the intellectual sheen of earlier tracks or we’ve lost our willingness to read meaning into their simplicity.The odd semi-collapse of Care serves as a reminder of just how fragile an album can be, how vulnerable even the most talented artists are to stumbling over elements like song sequencing, which many might dismiss as a secondary concern. When we listen closely, our perceptions of an artist can change on a dime. And because pop music can be so direct, it’s subject to harsh evaluations: It can be easy to tell when a pop song has missed its mark. Krell has succeeded in making the simplest, most direct album of his career. But that places him in direct competition with pop music proper, and because Care arrives at a point when many mainstream artists are making such remarkable music, it’s no longer quite as easy to accept on its face the distinction Krell made two years ago, between being pop and being populist. There’s no reason to evaluate him separately from the rest of the pack. Though several of the songs on Care are extraordinary, others are superficial, failing to deliver on the depth that has been such an essential part of How to Dress Well’s appeal. Pop can’t soar if its carrying dead weight, and there’s simply too much of that here for Care to succeed. \"],[22134,\"After two records about cheating on each other, it was inevitable that Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine and John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood would begin to cheat on Fleetwood Mac. They were traveling in separate limos by the end of the bad-tempered Tusk tour, where Buckingham had kicked Nicks onstage, and they’d circled Europe on Hitler’s old train. “Looks like the end of the line,” the New York Post warned in March 1981, as solo careers started to proliferate. Fleetwood released The Visitor in June. Where Tusk had taken a year to record, Nicks’ debut album, Bella Donna, was nailed in a few days, released in July, and certified Platinum by October—just as Buckingham’s Law and Order limped to No. 32. Her blousy mystique was the antithesis of his uptight theme, and to dent his fragile ego further, it had been validated by serious men: collaborators Tom Petty, Don Henley, and producer Jimmy Iovine, who she was now dating. According to Buckingham’s then-girlfriend, Carol Ann Harris, he liked to refer to “Stop Draggin’ My Heart Around” as “Stop Draggin’ My Career Around.”Having accepted that the band weren’t interested in “shaking people’s preconceptions of pop,” as he sniffed to any reporter who would listen, Buckingham resolved that Fleetwood Mac’s next album should be a proper group effort. Mostly minus Nicks, they mingled their ghosts with those of the haunted Château d’Hérouville, just outside Paris, a destination chosen to accommodate Monaco resident Fleetwood’s tax affairs. Harris observed communal meals eaten in silence. The drug intake exceeded even that of Tusk, according to co-producer Ken Caillat. It’s hard to find any comment about why they chose to name their thirteenth record (and fifth under this lineup) Mirage, though the resonance is obvious in hindsight: It’s the illusion of the band, rather than the full-blooded beast. Buckingham tossed off his songs in under two months. “What can I say this time\\/Which card shall I play?” Nicks sings on “Straight Back,” sounding like a woman in search of an idea. She pulls out her well-worn tarot deck—wolf, dream, wind, sun—and whips up an unconvincing sandstorm about how “the dream was never over, the dream has just begun,” while Fleetwood Mac increasingly resembled an inescapable nightmare.Fleetwood Mac’s internecine relationships and betrayals outdid any soap opera, though by 1982, they had plotted almost every conceivable love triangle and finally found partners outside the group. Mirage nixed any suggestion that drama and vicious recriminations were the band’s sole animating force, and flourished in the emotional void they occupied: heartbroken, strung out, and alone at the top. “Every hour filled with an emptiness I can’t hide,” Christine McVie sings on “Wish You Were Here,” referencing her split from the Beach Boys’ Dennis Wilson. Love and happiness become an illusion, an unattainable idyll only accessible to the gods: “Knowledge not meant for mortal fools,” Buckingham sings on “Book of Love,” though that doesn’t stop him and his cohort from clinging to the belief that someone, something out there can save them. “Never take your love away, begging you, baby,” McVie pleads on “Love in Store,” turning a trope into a frantic plea.Yet Mirage has a sunny desperation. Rumours’ harmonies return, the rhythms shuffle, xylophones tinkle, and acoustic guitars add innocent flourishes to every refrain. There’s a similarly nostalgic optimism to Donald Fagen’s The Nightfly, also released in ’82: Where Vietnam and Korea cast an ominous pall over Fagen’s paradise, Fleetwood Mac’s collective mania makes Mirage feel like fiddling while Rome burns. Buckingham in particular is hell-bent on leaping back several decades to escape all this mess: “Standing in the shadows, the man I used to be\\/I want to go back,” he growls on the peppy “Can’t Go Back.”Some of Buckingham’s perception-shaking DNA remained intact: “Empire State” is the opposite of “Oh Diane,” a daring pop song indicating that Tusk was the result of calculated genius, not just megalomania and madness. Buckingham praises the Big Apple and denigrates his native LA with a wild, removed lust that looks right through the object of his affection; when he sings about “flying high on the Empire State,” the lurching keys and harmonies make him sound like he’s being spun on his axis. (Fleetwood’s drums also sound fantastic, recalling Dennis Davis’ work on Low—also recorded at the Chateau.)Nicks also mainlines nostalgia, though hers is motivated more by loss than bitterness. “That’s Alright” harkens back to the country music of her childhood, and the precise mix is as rich as a watercolor where every color blurs and accentuates the next one. There’s a grace to her lyrics that’s absent on Tusk, conceding to a partner who just can’t work it out: “I can’t define love like it should be,” she sighs. “That’s alright, it’s alright.” And you can only imagine how mad Buckingham was when she swept in and stole the show with “Gypsy,” its chrome glint distilling her loss of self and the death of a childhood friend, and the optimism the couple felt as young bohemians in San Francisco. Buckingham is always attempting to harness his overheated energy to open up some kind of tear in the fabric of time and space, to step through and rediscover innocence. Nicks, though, conveys the sad wisdom of someone who knows you can never go home again.As ever, it’s McVie who maintains the most poise on Mirage, even as she languishes over Dennis Wilson. She’s just as lachrymose as on Tusk, but her songs rediscover the body she lost there. There’s adult acceptance in her voice on the Carole King-indebted “Wish You Were Here,” though the lyrics convey an adolescent morbid streak: “I can’t help feeling lonely\\/There’s no way, no way that I could stop.” “Hold Me” is one of the few moments on the record where McVie, Nicks, and Buckingham sing together. It’s the polar opposite of Tusk’s title track, where the three singers hissed their spurned collective demands. (“Don’t say that you love me! Just tell me that you want me!”) Instead, even as McVie is singing about Wilson, it plays as a plea for understanding and reconciliation between the estranged five-piece: “I don’t want no damage\\/But how am I going to manage with you?”They barely did. They fought on the video shoots for “Gypsy” and “Hold Me,” and the Mirage tour was short. Unsurprisingly, given the perfunctory nature of the sessions, there are few whole songs from the cutting room floor on this reissue: Nicks’ “If You Were My Love” is solid, and a more aggressive version of “Empire State” shows what might have transpired had Buckingham been allowed to make Tusk II. Warner Bros. were relieved that he didn’t: Mirage took the band back to No. 1 for the first time since Rumours, and spent five weeks there. The public preferred Fleetwood Mac as soft-rockin' comfort food. In a state of exhaustion and addiction, the five-piece papered over the cracks with an apple pie lattice, and saw other people for five years.\"],[22422,\"If you were up and around a TV set in Tampa on Tuesday, sometime after 10 a.m., you might have tripped into a surreal scene. On WFTS, Merchandise made an appearance on the local channel’s morning show, “Tampa Bay’s Morning Blend.” The disposition the show is supposed to render is sunny, cheerful, the perfect complement to a complete breakfast. The band was there to play a song from their new album A Corpse Wired for Sound, but not before an interview. When asked to describe Merchandise’s sound Carson Cox joked, “We play both kinds, we play country and western,” before getting at least slightly serious. “It sort of mutates all the time... When we started I feel like we were really snarly and aggressive. And now we’ve matured a lot.” Then they play, giving the early birds an unvarnished but romantic rendition of album highlight, “Lonesome Sound.” The performance is unencumbered and affecting, and runs in interesting contrast to the album version: a swaggering and distorted ballad. For those up at the hour, it must’ve been a strange scene. For Merchandise fans, it was a pleasantly confusing one as well. The band for a long time has maintained a strict policy of home recording, though what they've conjured up in their last five records has never sounded grainy, but ambitiously wrought. A Corpse Wired for Sound signifies the first time Merchandise has stepped into a studio (in Rosà, Italy) to record an album, and the majority of the material was written after Cox left Tampa, living between New York and Berlin. His bandmate and writing partner Dave Vassalotti stayed in Florida, though he moved to Sarasota. Their face time was limited, and the professionalized air and transient process imbued something uncharacteristic to Merchandise. The album almost feels buttoned up. Their sonic influences have widened, with dub especially playing into the band’s changing sound. Even though Cox has said in the past, “genres are not for us,” in their latest, the hair-sprayed guitars and general geniality paint them more as rock band than ever. The songs in A Corpse Wired for Song have gotten considerably shorter in length than previous albums (under five minutes for the most part), and they seem more spacious, or at the very least much louder, as if recorded with large rooms in mind. Yet, when you return to Tampa morning TV, a certain unifying thread runs from that unadorned live experience and the recorded one: a sentimental resonance. In the time between records, Cox and Vassalotti have gotten sweeter, softer, and better at writing straightforward love songs. “It wasn’t love\\/She was putting me on\\/I went further down,” Cox sings on “Lonesome Sound.” By no means is their sixth studio album perfect. It's an uneven experience all together, but by and large Cox’s admittance of maturity rings through in this record. Even if  the luxuriant guitars in a song like “Lonesome Sound,” are almost cheesy, it makes A Corpse Wired for Sound more anthemic. In a way, Merchandise’s uncoolness has always been what’s refreshing about them. This is present from the opening moments of the record, in “Flower of Sex,” where they give their eccentric approximation of stadium rock. If anything, the big room ambition comes off almost goofy and funky in construction and effect. Take for example the jaunty slinking synth chords that begin “Right Back to the Start.” Cox’s voice follows in like, pitch shifting and wiggling its way through the song’s surrealist lyrics (“My grandfather’s eyes flash against the wall\\/I stay up all night expecting his call”). Corpse overcomes its moments, due in part to concision and earnest songwriting. This is true especially of the the penultimate track, “I Will Not Sleep Here,” filled with syrupy acoustic guitars, a splatter of electronic noise, and Cox’s near cracking voice guiding the song. Lines like “Blood is thicker than water\\/But both can go down the same drain” teeter on hokey, but they’re sold by virtue of how genuine the performance feels. Past the voluminous catalog of influences they say went into the writing of the record (the paintings of Anselm Kiefer, Burroughs’ cut-up-technique, etc), A Corpse Wired for Sound is their least obscured record. It contains a feeling of strange optimism, as if each song was written for closing credits, or sunsets on a horizon that need driving towards. Even if unintended, the embrace of normality that seemed evident in their television appearance earlier this week points to a band more comfortable in its own skin: happy to sing songs about love. \"],[22370,\"If you're familiar with any Beach Slang song, you've pretty much already heard A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings. That's kind of the point of Beach Slang. James Alex speaks almost exclusively of being young, loud, and wild to reacquaint listeners with the dormant emotions they once felt were inextricable from formative moments: discovering the Replacements, playing in a high school band, making out on the filthy couch at your first punk rock show. He yells lyrics like, \\\\\"The radio is loud and wild, but I'm too drunk to spin the dial,” one of the more subtle nods to the ’Mats. Meanwhile, the main riff of “Spin the Dial” is an almost verbatim recall of their own song “Punk or Lust.” It too has a glorious, defiant chorus that shouts down every impulse to think critically about a record called A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings. This balance between my brain and my heart has been ongoing since Beach Slang’s debut single, “Filthy Luck.” It was one of modern indie rock’s most impressive declarations of intent and the resulting 2014 EP Who Would Ever Want Anything So Broken? was so fully-formed, it threatened to make any subsequent Beach Slang music redundant. They quickly turned out a darker, more diverse rendering of their pub-rock sound later that year with Cheap Thrills on a Dead End Street, and the exact same pattern is playing out with Beach Slang’s LPs. A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings follows the urgency and coherence of The Things We Do to Find People Who Feel Like Us by pushing Beach Slang towards opposite extremes: “Atom Bomb” and “Wasted Daze of Youth” are frenetic and chaotic ragers that stop short of expressing the actual rage that may have went into them. “All Fuzzed Out” is the template for the best songs here, the ones that are slower, longer and surprisingly autumnal. It taps into shoegaze and New Romantic influences that seem unexpected but were nonetheless telegraphed on their mixtape of cover songs.But for all of their attempts to slightly expand their reach, Beach Slang’s blinkered perspective continues to draw a thick line around those who love this kind of rock‘n’roll and those who have no interest whatsoever. While Alex’s unyielding earnestness is a major part of their appeal, it’s also the most divisive aspect of Beach Slang and the mere decision to call this album A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings—even if it is earned—calls into question whether he’s truly operating without pretense. And if there’s even a sliver of doubt about it, Beach Slang are basically unlistenable.Though Alex claims he’s telling the stories of his fans on A Loud Bash, the ones from “Young Hearts,” “Wasted Daze of Youth” and “Future Mixtape for the Art Kids” sure sound like his own stories told on “Young & Alive,” “Ride the Wild Haze” and “Bad Art and Weirdo Ideas.” Alex recently opened up about the deep adolescent trauma and abandonment issues at the root of “Punks in a Disco Bar,” but the lyrics barely hint at it. Despite Alex’s claims that his shoot-first songwriting style holds nothing back, it may actually have the opposite effect.Yet, the impulse to question Alex’s sincerity is necessary to create an environment in which Beach Slang can thrive. Similar over-the-top acts like PUP and Pkew Pkew Pkew contrast their anthemic punk rock with an abject lyrical misery that makes it clear their shitty circumstances are a direct result of loving anthemic punk rock too much. But Beach Slang are incurable romantics and when their best songs hit their mark, as many of them do here, other forms of music seem woefully non-committal. This stuff isn’t just on the nose; the effect is more like what Prodigy described on “Shook Ones, Pt. 2”: “Rock you in ya’ face\\/Stab your brain with your nose bone.” Of course, that can only happen so much before you become numb to it. For all of its subtle improvements, the choruses don’t quite soar as high on A Loud Bash as before. And while their triumphant debut ended with “Dirty Lights,” perhaps the best song Beach Slang has ever written, this album’s closer “Warpaint” is almost certainly their worst, a “Save Your Generation” pastiche that confirms the wisdom of keeping Alex’s vocals lower in the mix throughout the record.After all, it's difficult to resist the impulse to be embarrassed on Alex's behalf. In recent interviews, Alex name-checked John Hughes, Kerouac, and Bukowski as writing influences—a 42-year old man completely unaware that those three are often used as fodder for jokes about try-hard high school boyfriends. And yet, none of them really loom over A Loud Bash: there are none of the Pretty in Pink tropes that have sustained syncable faux-indie pop for decades, none of the misanthropic navel-gazing of Kerouac—and Alex certainly doesn’t share Bukowski’s attitudes towards women. Yes, there’s a song called “Hot Tramps,” but it’s likely a Guided By Voices homage. It contains one of Alex’s most genius lines: “Your arms are like a car crash I want to die in.”For all of their punk rock advocacy, Beach Slang are really just an atypical twee band—how else to describe their glorification of clumsy, endearing adolescence? Everything about them should make a cynical music consumer wince: Alex getting onstage looking like Angus Young on prom night and yelling, “We’re here to punch you right in the heart!” and reading fan poetry and covering the most well-known songs of his most obvious influences. It’s certainly curative for Alex, being able to relive the best parts of his teen years without having to endure the abuse and loneliness. And there’s a poignancy to Beach Slang that courses through every second of A Loud Bash of Teenage Feelings that explains why they might even be necessary: It works best as group therapy, a 30-minute reprieve from the pervasive judgment of adulthood. Is that lifestyle really sustainable or really any way to truly live? Here’s the first chorus on the album: “I hope I never die.” Simply believe that James Alex believes it and you might, too.\"],[22400,\"Few pop bands mix altitudes with the ease of AlunaGeorge. Down in the soil are producer George Reid’s basslines—sluffing, roiling creatures of many legs and the ceaseless forward motion of the animal brain. And up in the ether is singer Aluna Francis’ filmy, nasal falsetto, gathering frost as it drifts along. Off the strength of their first, excellently slippery electro-R&B singles, “You Know You Like It” and “Your Drums, Your Love,” they were shortlisted for the BBC’s Sound of 2013 poll, eventually coming in second (to Haim). Their consolation prize wasn’t bad, though: “White Noise,” a hit collab with Disclosure, scaled the UK Singles Chart to No. 2.While the duo’s absorbing first album, Body Music, followed faithfully in the vein of their debut singles—chirping, sinuous club tracks, owing as much to Aaliyah as SBTRKT or Quadron—their follow-up, I Remember, kicks up dust in some unlikely new area codes. It cribs largely from dancehall, but stops short of adopting any of that form’s humidity; these diaphanous tracks are a long stream of cool appraisal. Francis thrives again in moments of sass, but she also muses on more overtly dense topics like consent and modern sexuality. They punctuate long spools of interconnected synth beats that perfectly bleed together for a dance floor of noncommittal swaying.On “I’m in Control,” which features the Jamaican dancehall vocalist Popcaan, she shrugs off a lacking suitor by trilling, “You gotta go deeper than deep to get me off,” at once playful and damning. Its punchy house-lite beat is a distorted reflection of “Mean What I Mean,” another track hewing to themes of sexual consent, ultimately impassive due to Francis’ parceled-out delivery (“I mean what I mean when I say so\\/Not trying to be mean when I say no\\/So don’t play the fool and twist my rules”). In one of the bolder dance moments, “Not Above Love,” dark bass lines cave into another listless chorus: “You keep robbin’ my heart like a bank\\/No thank you.” It’s a curious quirk throughout that AlunaGeorge come in heavy in the verses—stuffing bass into every crevice—and then wind down or duck out by the choruses, stalling the motor.  The title track feels like the lone emotional counterpoint and borrows the well-timed stutters and slow-seeping synths of its coproducer, Flume. “I Remember” is a song so sorely nostalgic and bittersweet, it’s hard to hear on repeat, unless you’re the type to enjoy tilling the soot of past love affairs. Francis flutters around an old beau, remembering the heady and harsh times alike, finally alighting back in his arms. Reid’s slyly crushing, nipping and futuristic beat helps carry the emotion. “I remember, I remember, I remember the fights\\/Burning deep into the night,” she sings with soft, heartrending hope. “I remember, I remember, I remember your scent\\/When I just woke up and I’m on your chest.” Remembering the earliest promise is half the fun, after all—because next time, they could still surprise you.\"],[22045,\"From the moment Prince’s party ran out of time and the ball dropped in Times Square to signal a new millennium, people were waiting. They were waiting in the wee moments of the new year for ominous, Y2K catastrophe to hit, for worldwide web grids to collapse, for large scale chaos of another order to afflict the globe. That the calamity didn’t drop in the form of a Roland Emmerich summer blockbuster sparked an initial sigh of relief. But the phenomenon of collective waiting—to see whether the recent impeachment of a president would lead to the end of the Clinton good-times era, to see whether the courts would order the family of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez to return him to Cuba across the Cold War divide, to see whether the officers who fired 41 shots into unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo would do any time at all, to see whether hanging chads would tip the balance of a presidential election—all that waiting would roll out across the entire year in waves of succession. Long spells of anxiety and watchfulness would punctuate the year 2000, a pivotal period that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle when trying to pinpoint the origins of new millennium unrest and epic uncertainty.When she stepped into New York’s historic Electric Lady studios in 1999 and began recording her much-anticipated sophomore album, Erykah Badu had her finger to the wind. The tracks she was laying down extended what had quickly become her trademark vibe: that of deep-groove tarrying, wrestling with time, pushing up against and pulling at the beat but also lingering in the pocket while delivering pithy observations about temporal lag and the will to move. Her music brimmed with the suggestion—albeit a conflicted one—to wait for it. “On & On,” Badu’s breakthrough single from her 1997 smash debut Baduizm, became an anthem for this kind of indelible, cool-breeze, fitfulness. “Oh my my my I’m feeling high,” she sings with the distinct horn-like phrasings that brought Billie Holiday comparisons, “my money’s gone, I’m all alone\\/The world keeps turning…” It all came together in Badu’s sound and style: the image of a sister who couldn’t be bothered, who couldn’t care less about the time (“I think I need a cup of tea…”), yet who simultaneously recognized and paid reverence to black time, that which is past and that which is still to come. Her many references to the Five Percent Nation and Afrocentric cosmologies on Baduizm announced the arrival of new black nationalist soul, steeped in astrologically configured wisdom (“My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone”) and headed toward an Afrofuturist destination to be determined.To be rooted in the here and now while also resolutely and speculatively elsewhere—this was Erykah Badu’s distinct gambit early in her career. But Mama’s Gun turned an important page as she set out to pair songs that evoked the art of exquisite and romantically-charged lingering and hanging (the “urban hang suite,” as Maxwell would call it on his own debut album from 1996) alongside songs about being fed up with stasis, isolation, restriction and aborted dreams. In contrast to Baduizm, Mama’s Gun offers a more pointed, sustained, and grounded statement about what it means to get tired of waiting out and wading through the wretchedness of urban blight, the perpetual threat of police brutality and lethal force, the baggage from bad relationships and the sometimes oppressive voices inside one’s own head.Those voices open the record’s first side in a cacophony of whispers as Badu admonishes herself about a laundry-list of unfinished tasks, nagging fears, and floating enigmas swirling through her mind (“I have to write a song… I have to remember to turn on the oven… warm up the apartment… Malcolm… Malcolm… I need to take my vitamin”). What cuts through the noise is a burst of sonic muscle—pure soul energy compressed into 10 initial seconds: the joyful ensemble (Chinah Blac and YahZarah) bellowing in Rufus-meets-Brand New Heavies unison as longtime collaborators Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson on drums, James Poyser on piano, Pino Palladino on bass, and Jeff Lee Johnson on guitar lay down a robust opening riff that sounds definitive and defiant. The opening moments of Mama’s Gun sound much less like anything off of Badu’s first record and instead resonate unmistakably in the vein of two other releases from earlier that year, Common’s fourth studio album, Like Water for Chocolate, and D’Angelo’s game-changing Voodoo. All three albums were recorded simultaneously at Electric Lady. All three benefitted from the skilled hand of legendary engineer Russell Elevado, who mixed each LP and drew on vintage recording techniques to evoke the ghosts of venerable albums past. And most crucially, all three featured MVP player Questlove acting improvisationally at the center of an alternative black pop universe at the turn of the millennium, one with clearly nostalgic tenets that nonetheless held fast to present communal concerns and future Wonder-inflected aspirations.This was neo soul at arguably its most prolific and thrilling moment of growth and possibility. Innovated by black Gen-Xers who ardently valued and sought to revive their parents’ and their older siblings’ music and the albums that soundtracked their childhood, neo soul runs best on a seductive combination of cultural nostalgia, black solidarity dreams, and the will to couple sensually with an ideal partner while paying attention (somewhat but not always) to the politics of gender equality. And the list of remarkable artists who broke onto the scene alongside of Badu working this sound in the year of and leading up to 2000 underscores what a busy, passionate, and productive time it was.From 1993, when Me’shell NdegéOcello stepped out ahead of everyone with Plantation Lullabies on Madonna’s Maverick label to D’Angelo’s 1995 first effort Brown Sugar (often erroneously referred to as the first in the genre) a year later to Maxwell’s debut (Urban Hang Suite) to Lauryn Hill’s insta-classic Miseducation in ’98 to oddball soulster Macy Gray’s one-hit smash On How Life Is in ’99, to the year 2000 when Jill Scott made her first LP (Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Volume I), these were exciting times when black singer-songwriter musicians were referencing Black Panther memoirs, African-American Studies history books, and deep cuts from reluctant soul icons like Bill Withers. In the days after Voodoo dropped into the world, New York Times critic Ben Ratliff would famously describe the genre as “a mature music, and a family music, for living rooms, rather than for the streets.”“Penitentiary Philosophy,” the charging, opening track on Mama’s Gun pulls all of these ambitions together. Bursting with the energy and the righteous discontent of King’s letter from a Birmingham jail (in which he declared to the world “why we can’t wait” for liberation), it recalls the sonic palette of Maggot Brain-era Funkadelic while venturing further down the road of trenchant social critique that Badu had already begun to walk on Baduizm’s “Other Side of the Game,” her third single off of that album and one that planted her firmly in the run of socially-conscious hip-hop culture. With its looped sample of Stevie’s “Ordinary Pain,” “Penitentiary Philosophy” stays focused on the perils and corrosive effects of streets that don’t love you, streets that can trap you. “Here’s my philosophy\\/Livin’ in a penitentiary…” she declares, dropping verses like Gil Scott-Heron, “Brothers all on the corner\\/Tryin’ to make believe\\/Turn around ain’t got no pot to pee\\/Make me mad when I see you sad… you can’t win when your will is weak\\/When you’re knocked on the ground….” In the same year that David Simon dropped “The Corner” and two years before his masterpiece “The Wire,” Badu was still singing about the effects of the game from a woman’s point of view (something Simon’s shows were often, at best, half-assed about doing). Still the caring sister who observes the ensuing crisis from the sidelines, Badu has morphed on this track out of the role of devoted bystander into full-scale Last Poet.Badu gently admonishes her listeners to get to going, drawing on the Brixton trans-Atlantic migratory sound of Soul II Soul on “Time’s a Wastin,” a “Keep On Movin’”-style new-millennium anthem and something of a partner song to “Penitentiary Philosophy” that warns against drifting and advises listeners to “Make your money last\\/Learn from your past…. Don’t take your time, young man…” The brothers who are lost, the brothers who can’t find their way in an “oh-so-strange world” remain near and dear to Badu’s heart, and she offers them visions of the beautiful journey that awaits them, one that can change and restore their hope because “oh baby we need to smile…” Badu is no prophetess or preacher like her counterpart Hill, but she leans into this song’s alluring keyboard arrangement which, at the bridge, evokes the sound of the “incidental” church organ, what black studies critic Ashon Crawley brilliantly refers to as “nothing music,” the music of the organist doodling and improvising underneath the riffing of the deacon or the pastor or the volunteer bake sale representative. It’s the sound of sitting in the sanctuary together and having frank and easy conversations with one another as she wistfully warns of a future without a plan (“Ain’t no tellin where you’ll land…”).The Badu of hope, headwraps, and incense is still very much present on this record, voicing anthems about correcting one’s path and questing on tracks like “Didn’t Cha Know” and the sequel jam, “… & On.” The former track wraps itself around a hypnotic sample from New York-based fusion jazz-funk ensemble Tarika Blue’s 1977 “Dreamflower” record, a Badu obsession that she discovered while crate-digging, at the behest of J Dilla, through his extraordinary collection. Badu rides the chillout vibe of this song in the face of despair (“Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere\\/Didn’t cha know, didn’t cha know\\/Knew the toll, but I would not pay…”). In the Oprahfied age of black female self-help narratives led by Iyanla Vanzant and novelist Terry McMillan, she continued her rise as an icon of black bohemian positivity (“Free your mind and find your way\\/There will be a brighter day”). What set her apart from other neo-soul women of this era was her unabashedly quirky, black hippie stance which she kicks into high gear throughout “…& On,” spinning like the earth on its axis like a “Gypsy\\/Flippin’ life game from the right brain\\/Ascension maintained\\/Rolling through like a burning flame…” Badu’s rhymes summon the sound and feeling of late 1990s Nuyorican Café poetry slams and basement club, late night jazz improv.For sure, some of the album’s metaphors flirt with cabaret cliché. Badu got flack from some critics for the beatnik flute and cosmic references on “Orange Moon.” But the thread that ties these tracks together is the flow that is freedom—freedom to pursue new love (on “In Love With You,” a birds-tweeting, Spanish-inflected guitar ballad that finds Badu doing her best Deniece Williams impression and in duet with Stephen Marley), freedom to pursue pleasure (“Kiss Me on My Neck (Hesi)”) for herself. It’s a distinct kind of liberation from that of Lauryn’s redemption song sermons, Me’shell’s brooding tales of struggle and conflict, and even Jill Scott’s earnest Black Arts era feminist poetry.Ironically, it is Mary J to whom she most clearly pays homage on the aptly titled “My Life,” which swings with the hip-hop soul queen’s b-girl cadences. With its Puffy-designed excess and materialism, hip-hop soul was always at odds with the political earthiness of the neo bunch. Yet the bounce on this track clearly echoes that of the Yonkers R&B diva’s album of the same name. Here in Badu’s version of “My Life,” as on other tracks, she stalls to figure out a plan (“Standing downtown… tryin to figure out a way up out of this town”) and vows that “one day” she’ll be “flyin’ high.” Songs of strength and self-worth like her “Cleva” chronicle a moment when artists like India.Arie were using their music to reject Eurocentric beauty standards in pop (on 2000’s “Video Girl”) and megastars TLC were waxing contemplative about self love rather than outer beauty (on their 1999 track “Unpretty”).But Badu would consistently put her own bold and wickedly sharp twist on such themes. “This is how I look without makeup\\/And with no bra my ninny’s sag down,” she sings on “Cleva,” sounding like a modern day Moms Mabley. Badu lifts the boast and braggadocio so clearly associated with hip-hop MCs of both genders and turns it into the language of the R&B goddess, a lesson that one Texas-bred superstar would follow and master as the ’00s would further unfold. Badu is by far the slyest and most playful wordsmith of the neosoulsters as is evident on her brilliant feminist critique, “Booty,” the fierce, signifying answer to NdegéOcello’s bellicose (and casually mean-spirited) “If That’s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn’t Last Night).” Backed by a horn section doing its best take on the Quincy Jones-circa 1972-black sitcom theme song sound, “Booty”’s I don’t-want-to-fight-you resolve still stands out in a sea of pop songs across this (and last) century cataloguing lost-my-man, you-can’t-have-my-man, and give-me-back-my-man crises. It’s a song that also eschews woman vs. woman “bad blood” posturing in favor of extolling shrewd observations about the crazy things patriarchy makes women do to each other.It’s a singular feminist statement on the album topped only by Mama’s Gun’s first single and accompanying video for the track “Bag Lady,” arguably the first pop song by an African-American musician to overtly engage tropes and images from a classic work of black women’s literature. In loving tribute to Ntozake Shange’s 1975 pathbreaking choreopoem drama For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, the video for “Bag Lady” re-stages signature scenes and images from the play as the song revisits its major themes of self-love, self-discovery, unrequited love, gender conflict and communication, emotional and psychological bruising, failure, redemption, and personal fulfillment for black women. Produced and directed by Badu, the clip, “a poemeography by Erykah Badu,” features five women (as opposed to seven in Shange’s play) who represent the colors of the rainbow. Badu, the Lady in Red, begins by literally breaking out of the wide-screen cinematic format and moves in the next scene with our five “colored” women, strolling the streets together before ending up in the enclosed space of the classroom, a constricted site in more ways than one since it’s here that, as Badu sings “I guess nobody every told you\\/All you must hold on to\\/Is you\\/Is you\\/Is you!”The inadequacies of institutional education—it’s inability to address the specific needs and concerns of black women—are put on blast as each “colored woman” shrugs her shoulders to the beat of Elevado’s mix and Badu’s own deft production. To the church they head for a spiritual revival to “let it go, let it go, let it go.” Badu’s Red Lady advises her sisteren to “pack light”—let go of the harmful elements of the past--or else “you gon’ miss your bus.” It’s a song that contemplates how to not let the baggage weigh you down and make you wait, and it offers a way forward for women of color (many colors here) by way of a text from the bygone 1970s black feminist renaissance era.Like Hill and her sometime Soulquarian sister Scott in particular, Erykah Badu was not willing, on Mama’s Gun, to sacrifice extolling narratives of black feminist self-care for ones that exposed black communal peril, trauma, and tragedy. “A.D. 2000,” her broken-hearted yet clear-eyed elegy for Amadou Diallo is, in fact, a song that weaves together the profound sadness arising out of the recognition about how little black life matters in American culture. In the wake of the acquittal of the four plain-clothed police officers who took Diallo’s life, Badu sings a song for him (A.D.) and for the after-death era, one in which no monuments will mark the passing of those who were killed by the hands of the state. Thirteen years before Bay Area community organizer Alicia Garza would lament the chronic disregard for the slaughter of black life and, with her fellow queer black feminist activists, create a hashtag that subsequently ignited a global movement, Badu recorded a dirge for the newly-woke age of no justice. That she did so while enlisting soul legend Betty “Clean Up Woman” Wright to contribute vocals drives home the ways that she yokes together gender solidarity and black uplift politics in the 2.0 version of her career.At its core, Mama’s Gun is an album that understands just how essential black love is to any movement to fight the power, and it also recognizes just how expensive it is to lose it. Badu went through a high profile break-up with Outkast’s Andre “3000” Benjamin, the father of her first child, as she began to work on the album. In the wake of the split, she penned the aching, Chaka Khan-inflected epic that closes the record, the 10-minute “Green Eyes,” which moves through several different suites that capture the many moods of a relationship coming to an end. Opening with a nod to Lady Day-era jazz vocalizing, “Green Eyes” crackles with the sound of vinyl as Badu croons a torch song lament that rolls with fits and starts through jealousy, fear, resignation, regret, resolution. We move with her as she travels the abyss of her unbearable “growing pains.” It is a song that underscores the fact that, more than a decade before Queen Yoncé, Erykah Badu laid down the blueprint for a black feminist album that went well beyond documenting tales of heartbreak to address issues greater than the sum of any one relationship. She made a record that wore its awareness of the larger traumas and challenges that complicate human intimacy on its sleeves. It was music for the revolution that wasn’t televised.\"],[22419,\"Shape Shift With Me is, according to Against Me! singer and guitarist Laura Jane Grace, an album about relationships from a trans perspective. “Trans people should be able to fall in love and sing love songs too, and have that be just as valid,” she said in a recent interview with EW. In some ways it is more precisely a breakup record; the relationships described in the songs seem to radiate from a locus of rupture. “All I can see is the space in between\\/The space where you’re missing,” she sings on “Haunting, Haunted, Haunts.” Even the song about casual sex, “Rebecca,” sits in the trembling fermata between a breakup and new love.The previous Against Me! record, Transgender Dysphoria Blues, depicted the total shattering and rebuilding of one’s sense of self. Shape Shift occurs more externally, is more focused on other people, although the perspective still flows seamlessly between introspection and description. The opener “Provision L-3” is named after an airport body scanner that organizes the body into discrete silver polygons. Unlike other forms of x-ray, the images produced by the scanner are less blurred haloes of flesh and bone and instead look like naked tin people. Grace approaches the subject of the scanner politically at first, but her perspective soon telescopes into the personal and physical. “Hands in the air, assume the position,” she sings. “What can you see inside of me?”The album then shifts into its depictions of love, which Grace illustrates as a democracy of sensations, a constant shape-shifting in and of itself. In “333,” vivid descriptions of body horror (“studying sophisticated nuances of putting holes in your lungs”) collapse into a plea for intimacy: “All the devils that you don’t know\\/Can all come along for the ride.” “12:03” is about waiting for a phone call, and the shapeless anxieties that sprout wildly out of an otherwise relatively mundane situation. “Maybe we get where we want to go,” Grace sings. “I don’t know\\/Fuck it\\/Maybe the earth opens up and swallows us whole.”Other songs are about loving an absence. It manifests in the album art: A disintegrating figure, reduced almost to pure noise, licks the boot of someone who’s resting a riding crop against their head. Inside the booklet, the booted form disappears and the submissive figure wags their tongue to a gray and wavering emptiness. “All of the places that we never went before\\/All of the times that we’ve never had\\/They’re dead in the past,” Grace sings in “Delicate, Petite, and Other Things I’ll Never Be,” a lyric that’s an inverted echo of another, later in the record. In the dense monologue on “Norse Truth,” she sings, “All the places that we never went, all the time we never had\\/What about now?\\/What about that?” Both songs are about the way in which we see people we love, and the ways in which they see us, a flexible interpretive lens that never stops changing or revealing new angles. “I want to be more real than all the others” on “Delicate” turns into “I wanted you to be more real than all the others” on “Norse Truth.”The band’s music on Shape Shift is less straightforward than Transgender Dysphoria Blues. As a noisy, digressive follow-up to an anthemic rock record, it’s more a parallel to their audacious sophomore album As the Eternal Cowboy, and its relationship to their rumbling folk-punk debut Reinventing Axl Rose. Beyond this, it doesn’t resemble any other Against Me! album. The way it’s produced, they sound less like a band playing together than a band layered on top each other, giving Shape Shift the hollow throb of post-punk or new wave, a space deliberately maintained between the instruments so dread can build inside of it. On “Crash” and “Rebecca,” the band sound as clean and separated as Blondie on Parallel Lines, another album where alienation and absence establish both content and surface.Of course, Transgender Dysphoria Blues was only straightforward musically. The story it told was a woman realizing that she’s a woman and rerouting her experience of the world through that. Shape Shift is a story about what happens afterward, what it means to interact with and fall in love with others after you’ve finally arrived at a solid idea of yourself, and how this solidity is challenged and reshaped through these interactions. It’s an album about sublimation, about transformation. “I want to be as close as I can get to you,” Grace sings in “333,” describing an intimacy so intense, so close, that it’s like exploding your own shape, so you can flow into someone else’s.\"],[22428,\"William Bensussen should be dead right now after he flipped his scooter back in 2013. But anyone who still goes by the name “the Gaslamp Killer,” a DJ name he earned in his teenage years by alienating San Diego party bros with his dark psych hip-hop sets back in the day isn’t going to compromise that easy—not for death or anyone else. The Gaslamp Killer’s feral enthusiasm and morbid sense of style have run through his work from visuals to sonics, a beat-scene Black Sabbath in a Los Angeles otherwise driven by next-gen Pharoah Sanders acolytes. He still fits—he always has—but firsthand brushes with mortality have a way of shifting even the most detached cynic’s perspective. And GLK is no detached cynic. Instrumentalepathy, then, is what happens when a man known for his intensity steps back from the brink, still reeling from the haze of painkillers and the sounds of family voices he thought he’d never hear again. And while his work hasn’t been 100% unrelenting doom-sludge from the get-go—even 2012’s flag-planting debut Breakthrough shook hips as often as it chilled spines—there’s a hard-fought liveliness to this record that reconfigures his familiar tics and collaborative ideas into something more affirmational. The beginnings of the album as it exists now started taking shape while GLK was still in the hospital. Opening cut “Pathetic Dreams” features his mother’s voice stating “I love you,” an echo of the first sound he heard when he woke up from surgery. From the meditative stretches through its more characteristically hectic, live-drummed acid-funk assault, it feels like the struggle and strengthening of a recovery process both depicted through and helped along by his music. There are two cuts on Instrumentalepathy that came to be while Bensussen was still housebound, zonked on pain pills after years of sobriety, trying to recapture the feeling of making music that might be a substitute for narcotics. Fittingly enough, they’re the closest Instrumentalepathy has to a clear continuation from the sounds on the pre-accident Breakthrough: “Haleva,” like the earlier “Nissim,” is a Turkish funk nod to Bensussen’s lineage named after one of his great-grandparents and featuring instrumentation from guitarist Amir Yaghmai, and the penultimate “Shred You to Bits” is a growling beast of a track that would fit in cleanly on Breakthrough’s doom-breaks latter half. But even with the commonalities—including return appearances by Yaghmai, Gonjasufi, and co-arrangers like Miguel Atwood-Ferguson and Mophono—there’s a different, more nuanced aim here. It’s a trip to hear “Residual Tingles” unfurl from its subwoofer-rattling Incredible Bongo Band loop and become newly graceful and cosmic. When it builds from a floating sequence of organ chords into an orchestral flourish, it’s a clear sign that GLK’s is as comfortable with meditative beauty as he’s been with abrasive heaviness. He’s also having fun turning his ear to more playful takes on the weird: the hissing-grease glitch of Mophono team-up “The Butcher” is like a ’70s Moog novelty record tasered into joint-dislocating bass music, and the Malcolm Catto-propelled “Gammalaser Kill” lopes beneath rusty analog whistling that sounds like a run-down robot aviary. Most impressive of all is “In the Dark (Part Two),” a “digital bonus” that winds up feeling like the definitive closer the album can’t live without. Catto’s Heliocentrics reconvene with GLK for a nearly twelve-minute slow-burn crest of orchestral psych that’s the closest anyone out of Low End Theory has come to classic Spiritualized.And that’s what happens when you’re as infectiously outgoing and enthusiastic as Bensussen is: He gathers friends, then he gathers ideas. In late 2013, less than five months after his accident, he put together an all-star lineup of musicians to record as “The Gaslamp Killer Experience.” He made his beat-scene-cornerstone status into an ensemble effort and the 2015 release of the concert as Live in Los Angeles revealed how strongly his material could carry over from DIY-studio beats to full-fledged live-band arrangements. So as much as he’s still rooted in that one man\\/one MPC\\/10,000 records ethos, he’s flourished as an artist who knows he’s part of something even bigger. He uses that knowledge to help unlock the kind of revelations that come from realizing you’ve got another chance at renewing who you are as an artist. Instrumentalepathy is where we learn what GLK realized once he started recovering from his accident, and his work on this earth isn’t even close to over.\"],[22406,\"Richard Barratt was there. He was there when the Sheffield youth first started mixing drum machines and soul, when Cabaret Voltaire begat Human League, before Heaven 17 and ABC went global. He was there when pub DJs started giving themselves ridiculous names, like his own pseudonym DJ Parrott, and tried their hand at building a Paradise Garage on every corner. He was there when the soil-your-pants excitement at this thing called house music created the great sampladelic explosion of late-’80s UK pop. He was there, at the Hacienda (which he once gloriously described as “a vision of hell”), and at the birth of Sheffield’s own massively influential “bleep” label. He was also there when it all went to hell in the early ’90s with the anti-rave laws and the drugs, with the cult of the DJ and the lack of musical and human diversity; which is when he stopped being there. This is all unsubtly true. But as that point about Barratt’s disengagement hopefully makes clear, the facts of history can only account for so much. And while Parrott really did give up DJing (completely) and producing (mostly, kinda), there is a big difference between facts, and the emotional resonance of lives that create them. If there’s one thing that Barratt’s return as Crooked Man makes clear, it's the nature of the resonance which makes the story. Barratt’s stockpile of grumpy tales with hopeful edges is an opportunity to gather round a bassbin and bask.The basic premise of Crooked Man is house music as a classic songwriting form. The album collects nine vocal tracks, many of which Barratt has self-released in microscopic vinyl quantities since 2012, resulting in a pop-dance album that lives comfortably alongside Caribou and Disclosure, but with pedigree and craftsmanship, and zero aspiration to the “new.” In this, Crooked Man fits the moment: EDM songsmiths’ conservative structures top the charts, popular disco and house remixes gloriously restage contemporary material rather than deconstructing it, while much of the club underground rebels against these dated designs. Yet even though Barratt and writing partner—another Sheffield music lifer, Michael Somerset Ward—come up with results that are undoubtedly old-fashioned, they’re not the slightest bit nostalgic. The pair hook earworms with the pride of professional writers, methodically and gleefully revisit British dance music’s cornerstone structures (electronic soul, dub, acid-house), and reinforce the dancefloor’s inclusive, anti-commercialist ideologies from a position of long-held beliefs. That’s how Crooked Man ends up feeling like the unlikely product of the Brill Building, Wigan Casino, and, say, the Music Box—classy, classic, and defiant. It helps that the album is also deftly programmed and controlled. There’s a clear narrative arc to the sonic range—ambient-house chill-out to open (“Coming Up for Air”), a deep dub version of a Northern Soul classic (Soul Brothers Six’s “I’ll Be Loving You”), radio-friendly electro-pop (“Girl With Better Clothes”), and a gospel-house anthem that serves as an emotional exclamation point (“Happiness”). The vocalists too, an assortment of 20 Feet From DJ-style locals and lesser knowns, expertly play their roles. The angelic falsetto of Sunburst Band’s Pete Simpson appears in exultation and testifies against soul-destroying machines. Bostonian diva-in-the-making, Amy Douglas, brings the biblical boom. And young, boisterous Sheffielders Rachel E and Danae Wellington get involved in excellent kiss-off moments—not of lovers, but of modern scourges such as fashionistas, bankers, and purveyors of boring-ass beats. When a chorus calls for strength in numbers, they become a gang.Hence, Crooked Man’s overall vibe is the timeless aspiration of people who share great parts of their lives on dark dance-floors. All these songs boil down to the idea of community and its desires and rules, a set of signposts to keep the party going in the right direction. In many cases, these may be generic—Simpson’s cooing prayer to “love your friends” (“Try Me”), or Douglas’ motivational declaration that “we’ll get on the right track” (“Happiness”)—yet with a great big dollop of soul (and the right piano chords), they blossom exponentially. In at least one case though, it’s specific as all get out: “Tell all the witch doctors\\/There ain’t no presets,” rings the hands-in-the-air vocal hook of “Preset,” Crooked Man’s most fully-formed address on the beat-wise freedoms. Amid an insistent thumb-piano loop, the track expands, opens up and goes deep, with smiles and tears mixing forever-ever.  This is the natural oblivion of people who live long enough to end up justified and ancient. It’s a curse, but it’s also a source of the joy. Because being there isn’t all it’s cracked up to be if you’re not also willing to be here now; which, whether Barratt will ever admit through all his cynicism, is never a question in his music. \"],[22369,\"Most everything produced by Orlando-born brothers Edwin and Andy White has a certain freewheeling quality. In the case of their cultishly beloved duo Tonstartssbandht, this has meant a frenetic, even theatrical, approach to what could be vaguely termed psychedelic guitar rock, with a strong emphasis on touring and live improvisation over producing studio output. Tonstartssbandht has existed in some form for nearly a decade, at times as a long-distance project, Edwin and Andy each living in various cities and touring with other groups. In that time, both have maintained solo projects that, though distinct in sound, are in spirit very much linked to the work they’ve done together.For Edwin, that’s Eola, the title under which he releases his own murky pop songs, built mostly from staggered choruses of vocal loops. Dang, his first release since 2013, compiles a selection of recordings made between 2011 and 2015. Eschewing Tonstartssbandht’s proclivity for instrumental flourishes, these songs are pared-down and rhythmically cyclic, nodding to gospel and blues, tropes White warps and reworks into repetitive structures. While White’s enthusiastically straining voice is the backbone of all of this, it’s also obscured, soaked in reverb and vocoder effects. The result oscillates between sing-songy and droning, upbeat and disconcerting. Opening track “And I Know” layers an impassioned vocal performance over a two-note dirge, introducing the record with a degree of anxious intensity. In the songs that proceed, however, the pace slows, and White’s singing takes a gentler turn. The record includes two cheerful renditions of full-on pop songs—one a take on his brother’s “Big Chestined Nights,” and the other of Montreal-based associate Sean Nicholas Savage’s “Someone’s Got a Secret”—but White’s own songwriting tends toward something more meandering. This can be one of the record’s frustrations: though absorbing live, meditative tracks like “Daylong Breathing” and “Future Hymns” have a somewhat uninviting tinniness about them in this reproduction. White is an expressive and playful singer, and his songs are at their best when these qualities are amplified by, rather than buried beneath, lo-fi processing and recording techniques. Part of that Tonstartssbandht spirit embodied here is, personal evolution aside, a good-natured and perhaps wholly unintentional unwillingness to bend to shifts in the dominant sounds of indie and experimental music. Rather, their music’s tendency has been to create in performance its own self-containing world. Eola has social and aesthetic affiliations to a niche breed of offbeat small-batch tape label pop—most obviously, Arbutus Records and the Montreal-based scene around it—and such points of reference can feel, already, somewhat of a bygone era. But unchanged as it sound may be, Dang is an odd enough record to stand on its own, satisfying for its intuitive, rather than intellectual, approach to experimentation.For that reason, its curious—and seemingly very sincere—absorption of devotional tropes seems best understood at the level of the voice. On “How Far Am I From Canaan,” White reprises a gospel song made popular by Sam Cooke. Much unlike Cooke’s sweetly sung and singularly uplifting rendition, it’s droning and skeletal, but also overflowing with feeling in its own abstract way. White’s scratchy “hallelujah, hallelujah now” strikes as both unholy and, for all its grubbiness, at least a little transcendent. However unpolished, Dang still has a glow about it.\"],[22313,\"“I retired from my fight,” Hamilton Leithauser crooned with a smirk on his first great solo tune. “I Retired”’s very existence confirms that the singer didn’t actually give up, but Leithauser’s point about getting older and figuring out how to keep creating felt like a painfully self-aware revelation upon arrival, six months after his longtime band the Walkmen announced an indefinite hiatus. “All the fire in your heart won’t help\\/All the smoke up in your head,” he continued, figuring that “as long as [he] can keep the train rolling, then all [his] friends will always know they’ll never be alone.” Consider it a self-fulfilling prophecy tucked inside a nugget of irony: A song called “I Retired” directly spawned Leithauser’s next musical direction.“I Retired” was one of two songs from Leithauser’s 2014 solo debut, Black Hours, that he worked on with Rostam Batmanglij. Leithauser and the former Vampire Weekend multi-instrumentalist\\/producer apparently bonded over shooby doo wops, their deadpan version of which sounds like the Flamingos came down with a case of urban malaise. That vocal technique is all over “I Retired” and again on I Had a Dream That You Were Mine, emblematic of what makes Leithauser and Batmanglij’s first collaborative full-length the rare release that looks backwards without falling victim to retro pastiche.With Batmanglij’s piano and Leithauser’s voice as their guiding forces, the duo answer a question that has eluded many a musician before: How do you incorporate the music of the past without losing yourself in what’s already been done? Even those beloved harmonies represent just one tool in a deep kit, right alongside Spanish guitar, Disney strings, bawdy horns, tender banjo, airy vocal loops, and cinematic reverb. Together, Leithauser and Batmanglij work their way through nearly seven decades of musical history—from doo-wop and country-rock to Leonard Cohen-style torch songs and the George Martin-indebted baroque-pop Rostam often used to make VW twinkle—but they also don’t forget who they are in the process: one of ’00s indie rock’s most charismatic singers, alongside one of its most creative songwriter-producers.If there was any lingering doubt that Rostam was Vampire Weekend’s special sauce (before his departure earlier this year), look to I Had a Dream That You Were Mine. The convincing ease with which the duo weaves disparate musical styles together seems distinctly Rostam—the work of someone who made Afropop, calypso, ’80s synth-pop, samples from M.I.A. to Toots and the Maytals, and a half-dozen other global styles fit together within music that often was held up as the indie rock zeitgeist. Here on “You Ain’t That Young Kid,” a spirited Dylan-on-piano-and-harmonica act turns towards pleading slide guitar, then an echo chamber of angel voices, then a slow dance of ’60s organ and steel drum, then a tidy harpsichord minuet—then, impossibly, all at once. The five-minute standout ends as a gilded acoustic singalong, the overwhelming sentimentality of which is amplified by an Instagram-filter of a synth line growing underneath. Rostam’s production is highly visual, and listening to this record, you get a sense of all the colors he must see when he’s behind the boards.But RostHam is an equal partnership, and Leithauser reminds you why you were drawn to the Walkmen in the first place. He gives what has to be his strongest and most wide-ranging collection of vocal performances on record to date, spanning from talk-crooning to punkish howling to folk-balladeering to heavenly harmonizing to raspily brooding about as he first perfected on “The Rat.”Black Hours’ primary flaw was that it alternated sharply between Leithauser going Bublé in his own way and simply channeling his old band. I Had a Dream That You Were Mine manages to incorporate these two modes in the larger context of its 20th-century-pop scrapbook—on songs about longing and looking back, no less. And it’s the songs where Leithauser loses himself in what was and what could be that his voice sounds best. On “Rough Going (I Won’t Let Up),” atop a creaking piano line and a spiraling sax solo, Leithauser screams like a man possessed that he won’t let up, but he holds it together, and the song never lets its barroom singalong quality devolve into total shambles.This is a slightly more mature Leithauser, but that life experience can also be a curse. Over the course of the album, the streets of downtown New York become littered with memories, and even the good ones hurt a little because they’re faded now. The album is drenched in this wistful feeling, the crowning achievement of which is “When the Truth Is…” There are many moving parts that go into making this song work, from the echoing swirl of percussion and piano to the snippet of film dialogue at the end, but they’re rendered so perfectly, all you hear by the end is straight swoon. The main thing Rostam and Hamilton get right about doo-wop is that it often makes romantic yearning shimmer like a slow-moving disco ball.Towards the beginning of the album—on “Sick as a Dog,” the song that sounds the most modern (and a little like Spoon)—Leithauser harmonizes with himself, “I use the same voice I always had.” Indeed, it’s not that Leithauser has dramatically changed since his days in the Walkmen; rather, pairing with Rostam has brought out the best in him. It’s rare for collaborative albums between known entities to feel like equal reflections of both parties, but RostHam find a middle-ground in mutual longing for the past. It’s the kind of album Leithauser can be proud of—you know, once he’s old enough to actually retire.\"],[22405,\"Between their 2010 debut Gorilla Manor and 2013’s Hummingbird, Local Natives garnered a reputation in the indie landscape: dependable, gratifying, though not the most innovative. On Gorilla Manor, their cinematic emotions and soaring harmonies referenced the National’s slow-burning sweep and Fleet Foxes’ wide-eyed, bucolic tumble. With Hummingbird, Local Natives grew up with a more meditative album that dealt with the death of vocalist\\/keyboardist Kelcey Ayer’s mother. Though the rush of Gorilla Manor was missed, it was hard to knock the maturity and gravity that came with Hummingbird's more gradual revelations. Sunlit Youth encounters aging, change, and where life has led you. It is, presumably, an album where they continue to employ new textures and approaches. The difference here is that there’s a discomfort to the shift, with some songs sounding like old-school Local Natives tracks with a weak neon facelift, and others sounding like imposters snuck into the studio and got a few tracks on the album somehow, mostly yielding negative results. It’s a growing pains album, but not exactly a rewarding one.  Far from the indie-folk of their earlier days, Sunlit Youth leans heavily on the synths and flirts with big-melody pop forms. “Past Lives,” a prime Local Natives composition emboldened by its synth leads, is a moving mission statement for the album. Despite the album’s title, Local Natives write more about the passing of youth, and “Past Lives” finds its way into a steadily intensifying gallop that captures the feeling of life starting to tumble forward as you age. Closer “Sea of Years” lands as if someone said, “We need the epic, swelling finale” and produced a checklist of necessary elements before actually writing it. Yet while the production and instrumentation render many songs on Sunlit Youth flat, “Sea of Years” is genuinely gorgeous, another moment where the themes of the album hit home. The instrumental melodies underpinning the chorus glimmer in the heat rather than charge headlong. It’s a convincing depiction of where these guys must be at, making anthems with more of life's baggage hanging around. Then there’s opener “Villany,” a fluttering and pulsing track where Local Natives successfully inject themselves fully into the realm of synth-pop. There is mission-statement business on that song, too; the key lyric is the recurring refrain of “I want to start again.” Its spiritual partner, “Fountain of Youth” is the grating low of the album, with the answer to “I want to start again” coming in the chorus with, “We can do whatever we want!” Suddenly, the band starts peddling the brand of cloying, faceless indie-pop you’d hear as background annoyance at Anthropologie, or in trailers for a “Grey’s Anatomy” knockoff. Tracks like “Mother Emanuel,” “Psycho Lovers,” and “Everything All at Once” follow suit, conjuring a bastardized fan-fiction in which latter-day Coldplay made an album with the Lumineers. The big vocal refrains of Local Natives used to alternatingly evoke the glow of the West Coast and the real, transformative feeling that can still come from barreling down an endless American highway. Now they sound bloodless and unearned.Across Sunlit Youth, there are flickers of what Local Natives do well, but the growth of their sound feels forced and awkward. You'll hear the funk excursion “Coins” touted and celebrated as one of the biggest stylistic leaps on the album. But it’s endemic of problems on about half of the album: One of the big draws of Local Natives were their melodies and their intertwined harmonies. Melodically speaking, they stumble on “Coins,” and they stumble on “Masters,” and they stumble on “Everything All at Once.” In the midst of rebuilding their sound, they’re less reliant on the subtle song-building of their past and lean more on big and broad emotions like they’re auditioning for a headlining spot at Sasquatch Music Festival. But in this half-formed state, they come off more like a mainstream rock band who can’t quite nail the big catharsis. As a result, there’s something sadly anonymous about Sunlit Youth. It’s cloudy, distant, and inert when it should be effervescent. It clubs you over the head with choruses when Local Natives used to be capable of effortlessly lifting you up. As much as they try to sell that “We can do whatever we want!” chorus in “Fountain of Youth,” the song is jarring. They don’t sound like themselves, and it’s hard to believe those words, no matter how loud they sing them. \"],[22302,\"The artist Jessica Ingram’s series of photographs “Road Through Midnight: A Civil Rights Memorial” seems, at a glance, to simply portray beautiful or quotidian parts of the Southern landscape. But the postcard-ready images are backlit by an appalling fact: They were all the sites of racist murders. On his new Biosphere record, Departed Glories, the influential Norwegian ambient musician Geir Jenssen does something strikingly similar, poised at the emotional conflict between the world’s everlasting beauty and the evanescent atrocities that seem to linger around it long after actual events.While he was temporarily living in Krakow, Poland, Jenssen started to notice the sites where Polish people had been executed during World War II—the horrors lurking behind an indifferent natural splendor. He began to research the area’s history and learned of a medieval queen who had hidden from invaders in these same forests, and he started to wonder what kind of music she might have thought of to comfort her in her fear. The outcome is an album made mostly from heavily treated samples of Eastern European and Russian folk music, and its forbidding, haunting beauty is a sensitive encomium to the queen hidden in the forest, to all those erased by war, and to the other ghosts of history that invisibly crowd the world. Jenssen has explored this kind of site-specific territory before. On 2011’s excellent N-Plants, he drew inspiration from the futuristic gleam and looming danger of Japanese nuclear plants, in tracks where pneumatic basses and skating electronic beats gave the impression of mechanical architecture producing massive energy. (The album came out not long after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, though, uncannily, Jenssen says he finished it before.) Those flickers of minimal techno also crept in, albeit less prominently, on 1997’s Substrata, widely regarded an ambient classic. Though Departed Glories has elements of both of those works—the concrete context of N-Plants and the sparser, icier regions of Substrata—it eschews any beats, and exchanges a structure of geological movement for something more like classical composition.The title track is indicative of how the record is more like chamber music than anything else. It’s just fashioned out of tectonic basses instead of cellos, midrange drones instead of violas, and atmospheric squeals instead of violins. Unlike a lot of ambient music, it doesn’t wantonly spread through stereo space; instead, Jenssen fashions scintillas of sonic information into long, flowing lines of script. He homes in on places where minute frequencies push the red, unleashing spectral harmonies and beating basses on the sublimely austere “Down on Ropes.” On “Aura in the Kitchen With the Candlesticks,” flecks of guitar share a delicate duet with eerie operatic voices. “In Good Case and Rest” demonstrates Jenssen's artfulness with counterpoint, as a scalloped bass and a shivering stripe of voices lock into a tense orbit, and on “Wyll and Purpose,” he develops a monastic theme with the rigor of a composer working out a sonata.  Departed Glories’ strongest individual tracks are uncompromisingly abstract, like “This Is the Matter,” where a series of steppes chiseled into the face of a dark drone somehow has the presence of a hymn. It illustrates Jenssen’s signature ability to latch onto the smallest bit of dark matter and suck us into its core. Less profound, on their own, are the tracks that let edge-of-intelligibility vocal collages in the manner of Julianna Barwick do most of the work. But they play a flattering role in the album as a whole, which is how it should be heard; they also give voice to the lost souls still trapped at the sites that inspired them.Sometimes we seem to glimpse their deaths: “You Want to See It Too” is a work of breath-holding drama, seizing up and pulsing like a moment of terrible intuition yet slowed down so it lasts for minutes. And sometimes we glimpse their afterlives, as on the gorgeous “Invariable Cowhandler,” which feels like moving through a lit mist filled with silhouettes. We also glimpse the subtle, inquisitive talent that makes each Biosphere album an ambient event, almost twenty years after Substrata carved his name into the clouds. \"],[22399,\"Mykki is the first proper studio album by Mykki Blanco, but it’s just the latest in her long line of punk moves. The New York rapper has been rising through the Afropunk scene for half a decade, cleaving apart the conventions of hip-hop through her dense rhymes—hectic, often hilarious gasps of speech have their own internal scaffolding. It’s something Mykki offers in spades, from her declarations of  “smoking blunts wit my cunts” in the club to raging, “They swear they kingpins in Rio but really D boys in Jersey\\/Put a hit out he swerved, the nerve of doing me dirty!” But often enough, Blanco is radical merely by holding steadfastly to her persona: the queer, gender-fluid alter ego of the performance artist Michael David Quattlebaum Jr., a woman who’s the sharp-tongued, arms-aloft progeny of riot grrrl and Lil’ Kim.It’s high-concept hip-hop, a swerve from the brusque, heterosexualization of nearly all mainstream rap. And Blanco has been greeted by her share of raised brows. But this experimental persona is delivered so nonchalantly, it frequently undercuts the radicalism; it’s a facet of the artist, not an aggressively pushed narrative. (She’s already gone on record bemoaning the media’s usual response to her identity, which is to group her with other gay, black artists like Le1f and Zebra Katz.) On Mykki, her assertiveness never wavers, whether diving into top-shelf hedonism in the club bangers or keening to find love past carnality in the ballads. Unlike her breakthrough 2014 mixtape Gay Dog Food, Blanco’s full-length debut offers unabashed moments of autobiography: She’s Snapchatting naked. She’s falling in love for the duration of a pill. She’s talking shit across a club banquette, and she’s furious at her partner for those suspicious texts.Mykki’s whirlwind of topics have a heated musicality to match, jostling backpack rap with spongy neo-soul, usually with a chant-along pop chorus twining it all together. Opener “I’m in a Mood” is her most delicately melodic moment, a woozy morning-after twirl in which Blanco sighs, “My sweatpants they Gosha\\/La Costra nostra\\/Ziplocked them potions\\/I love my lip gloss and lotion.” The ardent electronic rasp of her voice is an analog to the gentle gilding of Frank Ocean or Ro James. “For the Cunts” is a bubblegum rap kiss-off that revels in bravura bitchery, with a chorus that folds in cliquish giggling. The album’s most hypnotic and eccentric banger, “My Nene,” balances the previously unfathomable: husky baritone lusting after her hot-to-trot “Nene” (whose gender is deliberately never revealed) with the hyperbolically yelped, overtly silly verses that land somewhere between Lil Wayne, Boosie Badazz, and the Lonely Island. (In good conscious, I cannot endorse “Boy am I in luck\\/Shawty’s bad as fuck\\/One look at the booty make my noodle wanna bust” as a romantic entreaty at the club.) These flashy moments are broken up with interludes of solemn introspection—twice as spoken interludes from Blanco’s diaries, in which she confesses a desire for monogamous love (which feels pretty punk in itself, nowadays). Most compelling is when Blanco raps her journey in the gruff, low-slung cadence she has mastered. In “You Don’t Know Me,” Blanco stares ahead, unflinching, into her HIV-positive status, her gender fluidity, and the misogyny that surrounds her, in an operatic tumble of disclosure: “Buzzing on the block, I guess you heard the news\\/I’m running through the city like a predator, I’m burning dudes,” she mutters, sliding into a tetchy bark. “Booling with my Hooligans but deep inside I feel the trigger\\/Smoking weed ain’t working and these Xans done killed too many niggas.” The tinny percussion offers minimal accompaniment, but Mykki requires nothing more; Blanco doesn’t need any help defining herself. \"],[22409,\"Bruce Springsteen was a young man for the span of two albums. His twin releases from 1973, Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle, were populated by teenage tramps who skipped school, acted cool, stayed out all night, and, generally, felt all right. By the time Born to Run was released in the summer of 1975, Springsteen was starting to put his childish things away. “Maybe we ain’t that young anymore,” he sang on the opener “Thunder Road,” and he acted accordingly. From that point forward, Springsteen’s music was filled with more hardened characters: men with death in their eyes, women who were hated for just being born. Everything about his records, from his increasingly gruff vocals to his toughening physical appearance, seemed to signal a push toward maturity. “I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man,” he sang on 1978’s Darkness on the Edge of Town, as if the authoritative chug of his band and his mean, clean-shaven mug on the cover didn’t say as much already.The most immediate selling point of Chapter and Verse, a new compilation accompanying Springsteen’s memoir, Born to Run, is that it extends Bruce’s on-record adolescence by five songs. In addition to the 13 album tracks he selected to represent his growth as a songwriter, the set also features, for the first time on an officially sanctioned Springsteen release, music predating his tenure on Columbia Records. For the most part, it’s clear why these tracks have never been a part of the larger Springsteen story, why he never felt the urge to pull a Mudcrutch. They mostly find Springsteen trying on different personas, looking for a sound that fits. The set opens with “Baby I,” a primitive cut from 1966 by his teenage crew the Castiles, and then we get the Townshend-worship garage rock of the following year’s “You Can’t Judge a Book By Its Cover,” while 1970’s “He’s Guilty (The Judge Song),” by his early band Steel Mill, is a simple, Southern fried sing-a-long. While none of these cuts will knock “Sad Eyes” out of your top 300, 1972’s “Ballad of Jesse James” is the set’s biggest revelation. Boasting a Levon Helm-worthy chorus (“Don’t you wanna be an outlaw, children?”) and introducing many of the musicians who remain a benchmark of Springsteen’s sound today, “Jesse James” showcases Springsteen’s already-arena-sized ambition at a time when he didn’t necessarily have anything important to say. It also feels like the first moment on the album where a recognizable Bruce emerges. The guitar solo forecasts the heavier work he’d do on Darkness, while the caterwaul at the end sounds a good deal like the one that would eventually close out “Backstreets.” Even the outlaw narrative is something Springsteen would return to again. Of the five new songs collected here, this is the one you might want to start preparing a sign for when the next E Street tour rolls around.After that initial run, we’re left with a tidy run-through of Springsteen’s discography. The tie-in with the memoir means that we’re focusing largely on his more personal work. Gone from the set are the more character-based tracks that appeared on 2003’s comprehensive The Essential Bruce Springsteen and 1995’s chart-focussed Greatest Hits. In other words, no “Hungry Heart,” no “Atlantic City,” no “Glory Days.” He does, however, make room for 1995’s literally-based-on-a-fictional-character “The Ghost of Tom Joad” and 2002’s fireman’s lament “The Rising.” But these tracks speak to a crucial aspect of Springsteen’s work: Despite the long monologues he’s been known to deliver at shows, his music has never been all that autobiographical. A telling anecdote about Bruce involves his right-hand-man Steve Van Zandt berating him at the inclusion of the confessional “Ain’t Got You” on 1987’s Tunnel of Love. “Nobody gives a shit about your life,” the guitarist told him, “They need you for their lives. That’s your thing.” (We’ll see how Van Zandt responds when the sales reports for Bruce’s memoir come in.)Whether Springsteen’s songs tell his story or our story, the tale is one for the ages. Much of Springsteen’s catalog was designed specifically to grow old with him (“If you wrote them well, they sustain,” Springsteen told a journalist this year when asked about touring 35-year-old songs.) Chapter and Verse arranges his work in a way that rings true to his journey. Following the opening string of songs, “Born to Run,” sounds here like the revelation that it was: a perfect distillation of the music he loved and a culmination of the work he had already done. Same goes for 1987’s “Brilliant Disguise,” a ballad sung with the urgency of an artist finally finding the words to express exactly what’s been on his mind. Other cuts like “Badlands” and “Born in the U.S.A.” help move his story along, illustrating the new vocabulary and sounds that defined the albums each track introduced.The more recent selections are equally powerful. “Living Proof” from 1992 is a should-be classic that captures the rush of emotions accompanying new fatherhood. “Long Time Comin’,” a song penned in the ’90s but not released on a record until the mid 2000s, is another gem. During early performances of it, Springsteen introduced it as one of his rare “happy songs,” but its joyful tone got buried by the more morose material on Devils & Dust; here it feels utterly euphoric. “Wrecking Ball,” a divisive song about a sports complex penned in 2009 to commemorate the closing of Giants Stadium, also speaks to a lot more in this context. In six minutes, it refits “Born to Run”’s momentum to a less glamorous narrative, refining the heart of Springsteen’s muse into seven short words: “Hard times come, and hard times go.” That message is also reflected by the album’s flow, spanning from “Baby I”’s prepubescent power-pop through the ghostly “My Father’s House” and finally landing on a place of acceptance.“I always picture it as a car,” Springsteen said of his career in a recent Vanity Fair interview. “All your selves are in it. And a new self can get in, but the old selves can’t ever get out. The important thing is, who’s got their hands on the wheel at any given moment?” The last few years have seen an uncharacteristic turn toward nostalgia for Springsteen that’s led from 2014’s Album Collection Vol. 1 to this year’s River Tour and the upcoming memoir. With the opening five songs, more than 60% of Chapter and Verse is pre-Born in the U.S.A., giving a heavy skew toward his early days. It’s clear that this wasn’t designed as a greatest hits set, or even a Springsteen-for-beginners mixtape. Hopefully, it proves to be an excuse to move forward and a way to leave the past behind. You can imagine any number of similarly structured compilations (maybe one of his love songs that opens with “For You” and peaks with “If I Should Fall Behind,” or a politically-charged one that draws a line from “Lost in the Flood” to “Matamoros Banks”). Chapter and Verse takes a relatively safe route, but it’s a beautiful ride: one where everyone in the car feels united and hellbent on making it out alive.\"],[22421,\"From their inception, Die Antwoord have taken an audacious stance against political correctness. The fact that Die Antwoord are two South African satirists who’ve gone all-in to fabricate their campy street personas made the whole idea rather rich. In the past, frontman Ninja has asserted, however ironically, that we can’t expect hip-hop in other parts of the world to fall in line with American PC fervor. But much how Sasha Baron Cohen lost the thread somewhere between Borat and Brüno, on Mount Ninji and Da Nice Time Kid, Die Antwoord’s sharp satire has gone from a bit messy to making dick jokes at a middle school level—literally.When child rapper Lil Tommy Terror guests on two back-to-back tunes early on, he doesn’t even make you laugh as much as your seventh-grade class clown once did. “Will I ever stop drawing penises?” Terror squeaks. “Never!” The next song he guests on is titled “U Like Boobies?” Likewise, “Banana Brain” is pretty much a euphemism for “Dick Brain,” while modern burlesque icon Dita Von Teese and Die Antwoord frontwoman Yolandi take the lead on “Gucci Coochie,” a song that may as well have been titled “Expensive Pussy.”What does it mean that two women at Yolandi and Von Teese’s level of fame succumb to rap’s materialist-maneater trope in an intensifying gender-conscious climate? Or when Yolandi appeals to salacious father-daughter sex fantasies on “Daddy?” It's hard to say if it means something transgressive—or if it means anything at all—but by this point, it’s getting less and less credible to give Die Antwoord the benefit of the doubt. “She bounce around da club like a psycho little cartoon,” raps Yolandi—an unintended irony given that Die Antwoord are on the verge of turning into cartoons themselves.Like most of the tunes on Mount Ninji, “Gucci Coochie” is most engaging when you turn your brain off. Like a more aggressive answer to ’90s electro outfit Prodigy, Die Antwoord manage to get as far as they do on sheer attitude and energy alone. Now under the mentorship of Cypress Hill\\/Soul Assassins anchor DJ Muggs (credited here as the Black Goat), Die Antwoord have grown more focused when it comes to crafting whole albums.But even with Muggs and Chicago rapper God on hand as producers, Die Antwoord haven’t quite become the legit hip-hop they believe they’ve become. On the press release for this album—typically entertaining but tellingly devoid of actual information—Ninja declares that Muggs taught Die Antwoord to “unlock their hidden powers and rip the rap game a new asshole.” If that was the goal, there was really no way to prevent Mount Ninji from falling short.Viewed through more modest expectations, though, Mount Ninji is not without its charms. The rapid-fire wordplay is crammed with tongue-in-cheek moments where Yolandi and Ninja switch on a dime between absurd braggadocio and clever self-deprecation. But even if you think that they’re getting better at their delivery, cleverness is not new territory for the pair who proved their mettle as performance artists well before they invented the characters they now play for a living.Some of the album’s more out-there moments veer towards a demented form of cabaret where hip-hop serves more as a means to an end. It makes you wonder whether Die Antwoord would do better to market themselves as art-rap rather than the “real gangsta shit” that Cypress Hill’s Sen Dog rhymes about on “Shit Just Got Real.” In fact, almost the entire second half of Mount Ninji—eight tracks in a row—simply plods along in a downtempo void that barely raises a pulse. Jack Black’s hammy presence, for example, does nothing to add spice to the circus organ-driven “Rats Rule,” and the skeletal “Stoopid Rich” and “Fat Faded Fuck Face” could’ve benefited from more layering. As Die Antwoord's energy level putters out, so too does Mount Ninji, an album too faded and immature to make a lasting dent on the face of hip-hop, much less rip the rap game a new asshole. If nothing else, though, Die Antwoord still have a fair amount of entertainment value left in the tank, even if that tank is starting to dip below half-empty.\"],[22385,\" Sadie Switchblade, the lead singer of the Olympia hardcore band G.L.O.S.S., once framed her side project Dyke Drama as a balancing force to that musical violence. “[It’s] pretty transparent,” she said. “The songs are either about trans girl problems or dykey lesbionic friendships.” The recent G.L.O.S.S. EP Trans Day of Revenge dices seven minutes into five tracks; their riffs taper off like a nail’s sharpened tip. On Up Against the Bricks, Switchblade’s second solo album, anger tends to remain interior, rendering the narrator sardonic in defeat. (“Dyke Drama” can be read as a meaningful shrug.) The closest thing to an anthem here promises: “You can’t count on me\\/I ain’t no sure thing.” Outside hardcore’s vital extremes, the thrill of materials straining against structure, Switchblade has space enough to pause inside ambivalence. G.L.O.S.S. is an acronym for “Girls Living Outside Society’s Shit,” and their music is about surviving in a world that believes your existence illegitimate. Dyke Drama songs describe a life lived on top of that, the resigned longing, the bruise you can’t stop touching, the scene of the crying. The title track uses radical iconography to chalk off lost years: “Is it too late for dreaming? To go back to believing?\\/To push me up against the bricks, grab my skull and kiss my lips?” No longer screaming to keep up, Switchblade’s voice moves between frustration and abandon—the circuit that electrifies so many pop-punk songs. Returning to words over and over, she gives paradoxical shape to a not-quite-relationship: “I don’t wanna stop, I don’t wanna stop\\/ Wasting my time, wasting my time, on you, on you.” I thought of the character from one Alan Hollinghurst novel who senses “the pleasure flecked with its opposite, with little hurts and contradictions that came to seem as much a part of love as the clear gaze of acceptance.” Up Against the Bricks may be a solo release, but it also affords Switchblade the chance to place other musicians in her design. The backing vocals are all sung by her roommate Erica Leshon and Joey Seward, and you can hear the close acoustics surrounding them. Harmonies slide almost unconsciously behind and ahead of each other. On “Cis Girls,” a grimacing snapshot of the ornamental status trans women often receive even amidst queer spaces, Leshon’s voice takes over the lyric—one of those girls, one of “those girls, one of those, one of those girls”—as if to ostracize Switchblade from her own song. “Some Days I Load My Gun” considers suicide in disturbingly straightforward terms; imagine “Everybody Hurts” with every gentle consolation drained away, leaving only the crushing weight of the fact. At the end Switchblade is barely still audible, overwhelmed by Seward’s droning organ, a single bright note held until it blinds. The looseness of bar-band rock pardons drunks and licenses the strange. Dyke Drama can spare the time to develop lyrics like “Day-for-Night,” describing a turbulent family as the kind of scene that film directors correct from morning to twilight. But that organ suggests Switchblade is drawn to other genres entirely. Up Against the Bricks finds her covering “I Just Wanted to See You So Bad,” a song Lucinda Williams recorded for her self-titled 1988 album, and it’s about as reverent as punk gets. (Any irony that attaches to the line “you were staying in a big hotel” must be self-deprecating.) Switchblade rephrases the rueful original in hoarse and frantic cadences, as if she were jabbing elevator buttons out of desperation. Who could lie down and relax with so many doors to listen through? \"],[22384,\"Back in 2008, A Tribe Called Red began a thoroughly popular night at a club in Canada’s capital, Ottawa. It is called Electric Pow Wow, and the group experiments with beats, singing, and samples to a frenetic audience. Combining the rhythms and traditional singing of powwow—music meant to accompany dancing—with an array of dance genres including dubstep, dancehall, drum‘n’bass, and electro, they create what has been labeled “powwow step.” Watching ATCR seamlessly jump from supercharged drums on a remix of Northern Cree’s “Red Skin Girl” to a sing-songy sample “Indians from all directions”—a clip from Jamaican dancehall artist Supercat’s “Scalp Dem”—underlines their iconoclastic politics in the name of First Nations. At the time, Ian “DJ NDN” Campeau has noticed, “We had a platform where people were going to listen to what we were going to say, and we should probably use that properly right now and just bring some sort of awareness.”Their third album We Are the Halluci Nation ramps up the activism and accompanies it with some of the heaviest and most infectious sounds around. The patch on the cover of the album underlines the heart and beat of the album: “500 years and still drumming; Our DNA is the earth and sky.” Canada’s CBC radio promoted this album as “critical listening for all Canadians.” Given Canada’s history of cultural genocide, this is a given, but the statement should be expanded. This album is critical listening for everyone.  The Native producer and DJ crew are loud and direct about their politics. The words of the late Santee Dakota poet John Trudell open the record, defining their “Halluci Nation” as “the tribe that they cannot see” who “see the spiritual in the natural” vis-a-vis the oppressive ALie Nation, who “see the material religions through trauma [where] nothing is related, all the things of the earth and in the sky have energy to be exploited.” The record’s anti-colonial message is poetic and clear. This is dance music, which could also be classified as EDM, but it’s also a range of other genres. At its soul, however, this is music that demonstrates how protest takes on different forms and to connect the physically and spiritually displaced. “We are the evolution, the continuation,” says Trudell in the title track, charting the course for an album and a philosophy that represents and respects indigeneity. Women’s voices are centered as much as men’s. Every song brings together a community of sounds and influences from various parts of the globe. The Halluci Nation is thus expansive and inclusive, from the yoik chants of Maxida Märak that sit atop the soft drums of “Eanan” to the rhythmic throat-singing of Tanya Tagaq on the infectious “Sila” to the pure pop bounce of Lido Pimienta on “For You (The Light Part II),” as well as features from Saul Williams, Shad, and Yasiin Bey. The first single “R.E.D.” features rapper Yassin Alsalman (a.k.a. Narcy) and Yasiin Bey, whose recent border-crossing issues reflect the reality of “ALie Nation.” Narcy, an Iraqi-Canadian MC whose work has always been political, spits out the line “Coca-cola soul controller holy waters,” a five-word collage that both reveals and describes the popular impact of capitalism. The voices of the Black Bear Singers introduce the drum of the chorus, one that calls for “original nation.” It's a banging rap song that brings together the pan-African, Iraqi, and Indigenous.There’s nothing small or subtle about ATCR because they deal in big issues. Two interludes feature the voice of Joseph Boyden, author of The Orenda. Just as this novel dug into the history of Canada’s settler colonialism—whose legacy extends through to the horror of assimilative residential schools and racist government policy—so too do these short monologues. Presented as phone calls to a prison, they provide stark images of the impact of settler colonialism.    But the foundation of ATCR, as well as the powwow, is the drum. In the past, samples have fueled some of the group’s biggest tunes, from the Black Lodge Singers on “Electric Pow Wow Drum” to Northern Voice on “Sisters”. The drum groups that ATCR sample are legends in their own right—crowds of spectators elbow their way close to these groups at pow wows, trying to capture the songs on phones and iPads. For Halluci Nation, ATCR worked with Manawan, Quebec’s Black Bear Singers, resulting in a clear, resonant sound that provides an approximation of the huge scale of a drum group if you don't have the opportunity to experience it live. It is to ATCR’s credit that they have been able to capture some of this size, whether through these recording sessions alongside Black Bear Singers or sourcing original a capella recordings from groups like Chippewa Travellers and Northern Voice. This comprehensive attention to sound makes Halluci Nation a relentless record: song after song of pointed commentary and heavy beats.“Members of the Halluci Nation are anybody who is willing to accept they need to learn how to treat other people like humans,” says ATCR’s Bear Witness. At a time when isolationist nationalism seems in vogue—a nationalism that denies colonial histories while refusing refugees—A Tribe Called Red have created a landmark soundtrack for a world in which we all are connected.  \"],[22418,\"Like many child stars, Usher has struggled with his transition to adulthood. He was too old to be lurking like somebody’s creepy uncle in the 2010 video for “Lil Freak,” and too young to be belting like a 55-year-old who’s just bagged his first under-30 girlfriend in the song “Hey Daddy (Daddy’s Home).” But on 2014’s “Good Kisser,” a louche wink of a song, he figured out how to relax into exactly what he was: a dude in his mid-thirties with the abs of Michelangelo’s David, the dance moves of MJ, and the money of an artist who released the sixth best-selling album of the 2000s. He sounded breezy and at ease, finally confident enough to date women his age. So it’s a little disappointing that on Hard II Love, Usher’s eighth studio album, he hasn’t managed to hang onto that effortlessness. But there’s plenty to like, starting with his voice, which sounds better than ever.It helps that he’s back to doing R&B. Over the years, Usher has toyed with electronic music which never played to his strengths. Songs like the fist-pumping cash grab “OMG” are made for singers who rely on over-processing to plump up their vocals. Usher has a warm, rich, creamy voice that needs room to spread. Experts in dealing with exceptional voices like The-Dream and Tricky Stewart (“Bump,” one of many bangers on Hard II Love) and Paul Epworth (the glittery, star-flecked album opener “Need U”) clear out space for Usher to just be Usher. Especially on the first half of the album, the production is as sumptuous and smooth as Frette linens. Even relative newcomer Metro Boomin’s “Make U a Believer,” one of the record’s standout tracks, is at home among the veterans. The whole affair sounds so rich that the rootsy Raphael Saadiq-produced closer “Champions” is as out of place as a poor country cousin.As “OMG” illustrates, Usher is willing to do anything in order not to two-step gently into that gospel-by-day, grown-n-sexy-R&B-booze-cruise-by-night stage of his career, even though “Tell Me,” an eight-and-a-half-minute quiet storm track is just begging for a raging fire and bearskin rug. Hard II Love will keep him safe for now. For the most part, it’s sleek and modern, and it snaps right into the current R&B landscape. The one thing that rankles is that he jacks artists on the rise to do so. From the vocal phrasings to the lyrics, “No Limit” is such a Ty Dolla $ign song that I checked to see if Ty had written it. Of course, younger artists are influenced by more established artists. But when the situation is flipped, few people outside the music industry will know Usher is borrowing from Ty or Jeremih. Let them gain more mainstream recognition before helping yourself to their styles.Then again, Usher is always trying on new personas, and on Hard II Love, he tests out thug-lover Usher. And frankly, hearing him sing, “Tell me what nigga is perfect? Tell me what nigga is right? Tell me what nigga been with the same bitch and she been holdin’ it down for life?” on “FWM” (“Fuck With Me”) is like Ja Rule trying to sing a Luther Vandross song.Transitioning from “Need U (Conversation With Priyanka Chopra)” to “Missin U,” Chopra and Usher talk about what they want in a partner. Usher answers that he wants a beautiful woman with a “nice thin waist, fat ass.” Chopra, on the other hand, asks for a man who makes her laugh and feel safe: “He’s gotta be effortless, you know?” On Hard II Love, Usher isn’t that, but trying too hard hasn’t sounded this good in years.\"],[22326,\" For the last five years, Pallbearer have seemed poised in a very rare position for a doom metal band—on the brink of substantial popularity. First with 2012’s auspicious debut Sorrow and Extinction and even more so with the engrossing follow-up, 2014’s Foundations of Burden, Pallbearer’s high-volume lurch ballooned from an absolute core of rock band accessibility. Within their slow-motion sprawls, you could hear the guitar heroics of the Allmans, the grand arch of Rush, and the arid sizzle of ZZ Top. They weren’t exactly kowtowing to radio standards with songs that always pushed or passed the ten-minute mark, but it wasn’t hard to imagine them landing there or earning an opening slot with a massive band and making mainstream converts that way. At least to date, they remain very much at that brink, a top-notch, highly acclaimed doom band with actual crossover status not entirely out of reach.Fear and Fury, a delightful stopgap EP from the Arkansas band, brazenly reaffirms that position without actually advancing it. The three-song set is a bit of an odds-and-sods collection, gathering a remastered version of the title tune (previously released as a flexi-disc single with Decibel last year) and two very telling covers. Pallbearer first takes on “Over and Over,” the last song from Black Sabbath’s Dio-lead Mob Rules. And then there’s the absurd and awesome Type O Negative hit, “Love You to Death,” a song where sex and sadism and Satan warp into one surreal chimera. Pallbearer is faithful to both songs but not overly so, steel-plating their smooth pop contours in a way that proves again their understanding of and comfort with melody and approachability.“Over and Over” becomes tougher in Pallbearer’s hands. The dual guitars are more tense and cautious, creeping with suspicion through the riffs rather than swiveling through them. And the rhythm section lumbers, landing each measure as its own fresh blow. “Over and Over” is a song of deep depression, where the exigencies and exhaustion of life seem more demanding than the rewards. But Pallbearer deftly pose the Dio lament as a threat, a warning shot meant to make you get over it. The way the melody lifts and the solos screech make the song too redemptive for giving up. Likewise, Pallbearer nails Type O Negative’s theatricality and melodrama during “Love You to Death.” Singer and guitarist Brett Campbell revels in the bombast of the original for the entire song, from the almost a cappella, scene-setting first verse to the wide-angled glory of the chorus. The churning guitars and big drums again add an extra layer of toughness to the original, as Pallbearer stakes its claim as a nominal doom band. But the gigantic refrain and the structure don’t suffer under that weight. Instead, it reinforces them.The real coup of these covers, though, is how they reinforce Pallbearer’s ability to craft and deliver hooks of their own. Even alongside these proven anthems, “Fear and Fury” stands its ground, with militant, marching verses lifting into radiant instrumental tangles. Clocking in at almost six minutes, “Fear and Fury” is one of Pallbearer’s lone attempts at the radio-ready format, and it mostly makes you wish they’d do it over and over. The monstrous, angled riffs remain, as does a rhythm section that pushes the whole affair forward. Campbell doesn’t soften or lower his voice to make this or any of these songs work. He just fits it into a smaller package for three songs that, taken together, confirm that Pallbearer’s doom is just light enough for liftoff.\"],[22366,\"Kool Keith is the kind of rapper who, instead of telling you he’s a Mets fan, says, “The Yankees lost but the blue-and-orange team amuse us.” He doesn’t meet new love interests, he has flight attendants cooking salmon cakes in high-heeled shoes; wack MCs don’t get booed off stage, they get shipped to deli meat plants in Quebec. In October, Kool Keith will turn 53. He’s been a legacy act for three different generations of rap fans, written off and resurrected innumerable times. He’s been deemed a goofy eccentric by those who won’t tease out the grim humanity in his writing, he’s been hermetically sealed in the space stations of his most devoted fans’ imaginations. But on his newest album, Feature Magnetic, he shirks off all those constraints to, simply and inimitably, just rap.The premise is clear: Kool Keith trades verses with an array of guest stars, packaged with bare hooks and brisk running times. In most cases, he pulls his collaborators into his own orbit. Necro spits, “You’re emo and you bump Brian Eno.” Slug sounds like he woke up in the early George W. Bush years, laughing about your insecurities over drinks with your therapist. Even the twice-a-decade DOOM appearance feels like it’s supposed to exist in this universe. Though his voice is at a slightly lower register and his delivery rough around the edges, it’s always a minor thrill to hear the villain fly in from Tulsa and drag a mark to the ATM.That said, Feature Magnetic’s standout track is the one that pulls Keith furthest from his home planet—specifically, to Vallejo, California with Mac Mall on “Bonneville.” The two split the difference between hyphy revivalism and existential dread, with Mac turning in a supremely tongue-twisting verse. Keith slips back and forth from a copper Continental to his private planes, cufflinks always matching the wheel (or yoke). In fact, the Bronx-bred legend is so agile on the album that when the bounce of “Bonneville” gives way to the stone-faced “Tired,” he’s able to stitch together the fantasy and the fatigue in a way that strengthens both.“Tired” is an elegy of sorts for his contemporaries who haven’t stepped in a booth in years, who “get surprised when I come up and shine like the sun.” And it’s more than that—it’s couched in the fear that Keith will become them, that he’ll sink into a La-Z-Boy and start firing off bitter tweets. Not that he’s showing signs of slowing down; Feature Magnetic catches him at his most vivid, steering Lady Gaga through the corporate labyrinth and ransacking the Burlington Coat Factory with his alter-ego. But for all the ways Keith can warp reality and carve out alternate timelines, there's the lingering sense that death is coming for us all.That point is driven home by Sadat X in the album’s strongest guest verse. After a clip of Malcolm X talking about JFK’s assassination, Sadat renders pools of blood and swarming ambulances, empty wakes and crowded unemployment offices. It’s unnerving to hear a member of Brand Nubian say he should have gone to dentistry school “and took the steady check.” Yet just when you think the album’s come to a head, when Keith is going to fully pull back the curtain and peer through the fourth wall, he follows Sadat’s verse with a wink. “Sounds like it’s a hard time,” he laughs. “I guess I gotta step out the Phantom.” You can’t pin him down.All the years with Ultramagnetic MCs, all the one-off concept albums and blood feuds with the record industry have left Keith with wisdom that he dispenses through off-kilter parables: “If you see a junkie kneeling, give him cold water and tell him, ‘Little kids is looking, get up’\\/I’ma sweat and do a lot of sit-ups.” Though he is, at his heart, that craftsman, stacking high his tower of jump-off-the-screen set pieces, there's something darker that lurks underneath. Lest “people get cozy and sit inside the paragraph,” as he sneers on “MC Voltron,” he litters the album with details from Koch-era New York, revealed in the manner of sci-fi world building. Maybe it’s a stylistic choice. Or maybe it's because Keith is from somewhere else entirely.\"],[22367,\"Randy Newman started strolling through his back pages for Nonesuch in 2003 following a commercially disappointing stint at DreamWorks, the mega-label that never was. Recorded while Newman labored on songs that would become 2008’s Harps and Angels, The Randy Newman Songbook, Vol. 1 also provided some insight on what the composer considered to be his canon.Bypassing his 1977 neo-novelty hit “Short People,” along with anything else a wider audience may know, he concentrated on songs other singers covered. Among those featured were “I Think It’s Going to Rain Today,” a ’60s standard sung by everyone from Dusty Springfield to Leonard Nimoy; “You Can Leave Your Hat on,” a big hit for Joe Cocker; and “Sail Away,” previously by Bobby Darin, Linda Ronstadt, and Ray Charles. Newman trod lightly upon his soundtrack work and offered just enough cynical jokes to offset the beautiful melancholy of the ballads. The spartan arrangements helped showcase not only his songcraft—his wry lyrical turns, how the verses interlocked with the bridges—but also Newman’s musicianship, how he slurs his vocals in a manner not dissimilar to his New Orleans barrelhouse piano roll. The Randy Newman Songbook, Vol. 2, released in 2011, emphasized sly, laconic performances, possibly because Randy’s longtime associate Lenny Waronker signed on as a co-producer with Mitchell Froom. Either way, Vol. 2 lacked the austere overtones of the first, as does 2016’s brand-new The Randy Newman Songbook, Vol. 3. Such playful laziness is an attribute here because Newman finally revisits the Randy Newman songs you know if you don’t know Randy Newman.First up is “Short People,” a song he once dismissed as a “bad break,” followed by Three Dog Night’s “Mama Told Me (Not to Come),” the Toy Story theme “You’ve Got a Friend in Me,” “I Love to See You Smile” from Parenthood that later worked its way into a Colgate commercial, and “Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear,” which Scooter once performed with Fozzie Bear on “The Muppet Show.” It’s the sunny side of Newman. However, the spartan arrangements and light touch on Vol. 3 undercut the sentimentality and whimsy since they’re executed with the same sense of mischief as the idiosyncratic renditions of deep cuts on Vol. 2.Such aesthetic continuity becomes evident on the four-LP collection The Randy Newman Songbook, which consolidates and reshuffles all three albums, adding five exclusive bonus tracks to the whole shebang (initially available as a vinyl-only set, the box will later be released on CD and as a download). Allegedly reassembled according to theme, the four LPs still roughly correspond to the sequencing of the three initial volumes, which means it gains momentum as it progresses, with buoyancy eventually overtaking precision.As the four albums play, a whirl of character sketches, satire, sincerity, and heartbreak float by, the work of a writer who values economy over all else. But most impressive is how Newman plays with and rearranges his own songs. Sometimes he finds them so perfectly crafted he can’t stray from his original template, other times he gives them a distinctly different spin. Take “Rollin’,” the bittersweet conclusion to 1974’s Good Old Boys newly recorded for Vol. 3. As a bemused antithesis to the gloss of “I Love L.A.,” its irony shines as bright as Newman’s earnest love for his hometown. The ease of Vol. 3 allows it to stand on its own as straight-up entertainment, but better to take the four-LP box as a whole. It captures so many different elements of Newman in one hefty set. But don’t mistake these latter-day renditions for the definitive versions. For some reason or another, Newman hasn’t gotten around to revisiting a few major songs off his ’70s albums, which were masterpieces of the golden age of major labels, exquisitely produced that thrived on their California sheen. Instead, The Randy Newman Songbook, especially in its four-LP incarnation, is proof that a songbook isn’t something carved in concrete. It’s a living, breathing thing whose contents and meanings can change over time, even for its own author.Correction: This review originally included a statement suggesting that Newman conceived Vol. 1 of the Songbook series to buy time while writing his album Harps and Angels. However, the conception of the Songbook series pre-dates his work on that album.\"],[22402,\"Maybe you’re the person who hasn’t quite made up their mind up about Led Zeppelin. That’s fine but fair warning, the band is the apotheosis of overstuffed arena rock, from private jets to strong-arming managers to personal excess in every musical, sexual, and philosophical front. Lester Bangs wanted to chuck pies at them in defense of Truth and\\/or Iggy Pop. Hammer of the Gods depicted them as decadent goons and tried to make that seem admirable. Yo La Tengo’s “Sugarcube” video, without even needing to name them, reduced their lyrical and aesthetic sensibilities to an interest in “where the hobbits dwell.” If you’re a young music head who shuns rockism, appropriation, and womanizing as loathsome retrograde traits to be avoided, being into Zep means your faves don’t come more problematic.Still, rock dorks were tangling with this issue long before any of us, and in the context of reckoning with Led Zeppelin—especially as an oft-bootlegged yet still elusive live-band document—the official two-disc release of BBC Sessions in 1997 felt like a moment of clarity. Rhino’s 2016 reissue of the BBC Sessions is also a big important musical-legacy package deal, and justifiably so: Jimmy Page supervised a new remaster in the spirit of the studio album reissues that commenced two years ago, there’s an additional third disc that includes an unearthed performance that hadn’t been heard since its original 1969 broadcast, Dave Lewis’ contextual liner notes are informative and revelatory, and if you just love black-and-white photos of arcane recording gear and empty performance halls, you’re in luck. But above all that, it’s an exhaustive look at the lengths Led Zeppelin would go to for a chance to make it big through sheer force of music, and it’s borne out by witnessing the band in the process their own self-creation.Aside from Jimi Hendrix, a few jazzy UK prog bands, and the artists in the orbit of Miles Davis’ electric period, nobody working at deconstructing rock‘n’roll took such advantage of the possibilities of improvisation. To know Zeppelin as musicians puts that into focus: Jimmy Page flourished as an ex-session guitarist who still wanted to try any style as his own. John Bonham was so in the pocket even the fractions between the one and the two sounded deep. John Paul Jones strode with purpose along the border between groove’s backbone and a nomadic soloist whether on bass or keys. And Robert Plant’s voice could wring a Valhallan catharsis out of reading the cooking instructions on a box of macaroni. In isolation they were great; as an ensemble they were supernatural. It’s not that they were merely shredding or otherwise showing off: Led Zeppelin wanted to find out where those sounds they built, borrowed, and stole could really go. The first disc of BBC Sessions covers a stretch from early March to early August of 1969, a couple months after the release of their self-titled debut and a few before they dropped Led Zeppelin II. It seems wrong to call such a short stretch of time between first and second albums a “transitional period,” but that's what these sessions capture. The churning, riff-splintering heavy blues-rock of their debut is already shoving against the confines of what they’d already put to tape. They do their damnedest to wring new vistas from old Willie Dixon numbers on “You Shook Me” and “I Can’t Quit You Baby,” and there are moments where everything converges in waves of virtuosity that hint at picking up where the soon-to-disband Cream left off in the blues-rock supergroup sweepstakes. It’s when they stretch their legs on “Dazed and Confused”—still roughly album-length thanks to time constraints, and not yet the leviathan 20-minute concert centerpiece it was growing into—that their signature interplay starts to set them apart as their own entity, impossible to reproduce because they couldn’t stop moving.The in-progress nature of their 1969 material brings out some unpredictable sides. Hearing them hammer through live-set favorite “Somethin’ Else” in rockabilly mode is borderline surreal, especially with Plant rampaging through a vocal diametrically opposed to Eddie Cochran’s. And the third disc’s unearthing of a three-song session once feared lost is a fine addition—as well as the first time anyone born after 1969 can hear the piano-driven, harmonica-blasting “Sunshine Woman,” a B.B.\\/Albert\\/Freddie King-simpatico cut which is perhaps their shortest line to electric blues as contemporary style rather than a mythical predecessor. (The sound is not great here. After the masters were erased, these cuts had to be sourced from a recording off of AM radio, but they’re an exception on a collection with otherwise pristine fidelity.) The most crucial detail of their ’69 sets is how nearly every BBC performance at the time included some variation of “Communication Breakdown.” You’d think it was their signature hit, or at least a cut that’d give them more critical affinity to the MC5 than Uriah Heep. It’s always the springboard for something new, from a revelation of how many ways Page could either slice or bulldoze his way through his solo to a hint at their engagement with funk that wouldn’t be heard so clearly again until The Song Remains the Same four years later. If the 1969 sessions were Zeppelin figuring out who they were, the 1971 sessions were Led Zeppelin figuring out who they weren’t. Broadcast on BBC Radio One’s “In Concert” on April 4, 1971, and famously featuring the first-ever version of “Stairway to Heaven” eight months before the release of Led Zeppelin IV, the second disc features the band stepping into the vast musical expanse they had laid before themselves. III was released the previous October and was their first shot at pushing beyond their “blooze” rep to more vivid folk influences. There’s still a medley that builds off “Whole Lotta Love” to skulk through foundational classics by John Lee Hooker (“Boogie Chillun”), Bukka White (“Fixin’ to Die Blues”), Arthur Crudup (“That’s Alright Mama”), and Elvis Presley (“A Mess of Blues”), but this chops-fest belies how hard the press mocked them for coming from a place the band would rather live in than visit as tourists. And the peak-blues “Since I’ve Been Loving You” is where they finally figured out how to use their explosive power sparingly. Page’s solo and Plant’s wails pierce so deeply because they emerge from one of their most contemplative arrangements.But their confidence and their chafing at being pigeonholed made for a creatively lucrative combination and the period between the releases of III and IV was the best time to capture that. So we get the heavy metal equivalent of a chromed-god Jack Kirby Thor drawing in “Immigrant Song,” the careening time signature of a power-trio version of “Black Dog,” and the acoustic Joni Mitchell-fueled heartbreak of “Going to California.” Of course there’s “Dazed and Confused” snatched from its blues-rock cradle and transformed into the Kubrick 2001 psychedelic stargate sequence of their live set, bowed guitar and everything. And if overexposure hasn’t dulled your senses to “Stairway to Heaven,” you can hear it as it first sounded before it was played approximately two billion times on the radio—even if the last Page solo hadn’t yet found its footing.From a present-day perspective, where big-time arena-filling rock has settled on Muse, Foo Fighters, and 5 Seconds of Summer, diving headlong into the ’69\\/’71 timeframe of the band that most necessitated the obnoxious yet fitting phrase “Rock Gods” might otherwise feel like history homework. But BBC Sessions captures an actual excitement, a document of a moment in an oft-told story of a band that isn’t excessively beholden to it. No Song Remains the Same audio-visual stoner-movie overkill, no excess studio futzing, no sense that their peak was either already there or just in the rearview. It’s just a meticulous document of a band whose hedonism kept them from restraining their absurd level of mastery. So here: have Zep as they both wanted to be and eventually were.\"],[22382,\"While I was talking to Portland solo guitarist Marisa Anderson a few months ago, she lamented that at almost any point of an interview, she would be asked about the influence of John Fahey. Her pat reply went along the lines of sharing similar influences as Fahey (old blues, bluegrass, and country), but not being influenced by Fahey himself. No matter the guitarist or era, Fahey casts a long shadow from the early ’60s well into the 21st century, either from his direct influence or by association with his Takoma label (see also Leo Kottke and Robbie Basho). John Fahey’s renown follows the likes of American Primitive artists, be they Jack Rose, Cian Nugent, William Tyler, or Chuck Johnson, and it no doubt turns up whenever a new edition of Tompkins Square’s Imaginational Anthem series arrives. For its eighth iteration though, Imaginational Anthem escapes easy allusion to the man. Subtitled “The Private Press,” this compilation features a clutch of nearly un-Googleable guitarists like Tom Armstrong, Herb Moore, and Nancy Tucker, who don’t once bring to mind Fahey’s six-string explorations. Compiled by former Other Music buyer Michael Klausmann and collector Brooks Rice, this edition of IA emphasizes the outsider musician, the ones who took matters into their own hands. Instead of waiting for someone else to ink them to a record deal, they simply pressed their own albums. What didn’t get sold at coffeehouse gigs wound up at Salvation Army or stuffed into used bins. In the case of Rick Deitrick’s 1978 album Gentle Wilderness (represented by the lovely rumination “Missy Christa”), he left them on hiking trails “so people would find them.”The private press album is a fetish object among certain vinyl collectors, that rare musical treasure never to be scored in the Urban Outfitters record racks. It’s the subject of hardbound art books, prime material for reissues, and a veritable goldmine of untapped and hard-to-source samples. Endless Boogie guitarist Paul Major once compared finding and listening to such an album as akin to being in the Twilight Zone, the incredibly private sound of these unknown musicians casting “an underlying warm but surreal eerie feeling.” Fittingly, John Fahey pressed up his own records and stashed them in record bins at the start of his career as well.Warm and surreal are good descriptors for this fetching and restful set that spans from 1968 to 1995. It’s home to 14 unique voices and their paths not taken. Perry Lederman’s brief “One Kind Favor” ranks as the “best-known” artist of the set, though the notes point out that’s only because he kept company with the likes of Jerry Garcia and Jefferson Airplane’s Jorma Kaukonen. It might last less than two minutes, but shows his influence from Indian raga (he even studied sarod with Ali Akbar Khan) and bottleneck blues. Joe Bethancourt’s “Raga” swathes his guitar strings in copious amounts of tremolo and reverb like fellow American Primitive icon Sandy Bull but with just enough wrinkles to sound only like himself.Raga is a definite reference throughout the set, as is Greenwich Village folk, the music of the Scot-Irish hinterlands, and old-timey string bands. But no matter the source, it’s remarkable how these players weave something idiosyncratic out of their influences. Gary Salzman’s seven-minute fantasia “The Secret Forces of Nature” segues from clean finger-picking to sitar buzz to dobro before dissolving into some strange musique concrète. Herb Moore’s sparkling “Wen Also Found” from 1983 is an acoustic guitar piece that slyly multi-tracks other melodic figures and his own resonant sculpture (called the “scrapophone”) to beautiful effect. Moore might never be considered a figurehead of American Primitive guitar, but perhaps he’ll inspire a new strand: The liner notes tell us Moore was an early pioneer of computer music during Silicon Valley days, co-authored a book about Atari gaming consoles, and set human genome DNA sequences to sound. Let’s see Fahey top that. \"],[22383,\"For an album that radiates solemnity, Grumbling Fur’s Furfour is surprisingly preoccupied with television. Its trailer has the aesthetic of a scrambled cable signal, lines blurring into swirls as seen through dilated eyes. Snippets of found dialogue at the beginnings and ends of songs evoke channel surfing. The device itself is mentioned more than once in the London psych-pop duo’s lyrics, too, most strikingly in the chanted chorus of “Silent Plans\\/Black Egg”: “I can see through the day\\/To the fridge and television.” It’s an image that, like much of Furfour, suggests both a constant, voluntary awareness of the outside world and a simultaneous urge to escape from it.  The great selling point of psychedelic music is the distance it puts between the listener and material reality. Even in the absence of drugs, it’s spirituality without religion—or, at least, it’s immersive and abstract enough to transport you. But something curious is happening, now that hysterical news cycles and frenetic workdays can follow us to bed at night via smartphone. Artists who would’ve led us into reveries a decade ago are now making music that admits the impossibility of mental vacations. Morgan Delt’s recent album, Phase Zero, quotes clickbait and frets about the apocalypse. Of Montreal’s adds internet slang to Kevin Barnes’ robust vocab list and up-to-the-minute identity politics to his fantastical subversion of the gender binary.  On Furfour, so titled because it’s their fourth album, Grumbling Fur’s Alexander Tucker and Daniel O’Sullivan have a subtle way of honoring reality while tilting towards transcendence. They’ve often described their music as a collage; their drowsy voices rest atop synthesizers, clips of sound and speech, and an array of organic instruments. In this case, the collage effect extends to the album’s themes, too. The multi-instrumentalists paste images of drudgery and loneliness onto a larger canvas that uses the language of science fiction to express a hunger for spiritual stimulation: “The ultraviolet sun\\/You know it radiates through everyone\\/But the show it must go on go on and on and on,” they sing in unison on “Heavy Days.”Once an improvisationally inclined quartet, Grumbling Fur found themselves writing pop songs as a two-piece sometime after the release of their 2011 debut, Furrier. Furfour is a bit of a comedown from the two hallucinatory albums that followed, 2013’s Glynnaestra and 2014’s Preternaturals. Only its thumping first single, “Acid Ali Khan,” achieves the abandon of those two records. But you rarely miss it. Tucker and O’Sullivan are still working within the realm of psychedelia, and still collaging sounds in unexpected ways. “Pyewacket’s Palace,” a wordless piece of sound art situated midway through the album, trembles its way from the strings and timpani of a vintage film score to the choral sighs of heavenly ascension. Here they prove they know how to deploy a guest musician, too: the fluttery, wired flute at the end of “Golden Simon” comes courtesy of Bardo Pond’s Isobel Sollenberger. But this is the first Grumbling Fur album that suggests a meditative trance more than an intoxicated daydream. With the exception of “Sapien Sapiens,” which layers a robotic speech about evolution and genetic engineering over ponderous drones in a way that feels surprisingly obvious, Furfour is too rich with ideas to become a drag.Rooted in a long, strange tradition of English experimentalism that also includes bands like Throbbing Gristle and Coil, Furfour is most reminiscent of Brian Eno’s post-glam, pre-ambient albums from the mid-’70s—it’s music that proves pop is as fertile a genre for conceptual songwriting as any other. “Silent Plans\\/Black Egg” transitions from a violin-led dirge of quotidian exhaustion to a glitchy bed of noise that’s eventually paired with a clip of someone reading from the Book of Revelation. It sounds like the dream you might have if you fell asleep in front of that TV from the chorus. Eno is also a great collaborator, but he never had a partnership quite as intimate as the one that underlies Tucker and O’Sullivan’s spirit of sonic inquiry. From the White Stripes to OutKast, duos are often studies in contrasts. On paper, Grumbling Fur are similarly mismatched. Tucker, a comic book artist who also records as a solo act and plays in the psych-folk duo Imbogodom, is entirely self-taught. “Put me in a room with instruments and I can play every single one of them—but I also have no knowledge at all of the mechanics,” he told FACT. O’Sullivan is a classically trained musician whose other past and current projects—proggy Guapo and the Norwegian post-metal act Ulver among them—hinge on technical mastery. But the music they make together is remarkably coherent. Crowded as it is with instruments and ideas, Grumbling Fur doesn’t sound like a collision of sensibilities. Down to Tucker and O’Sullivan’s fondness for blending their voices, the band is an experiment in subsuming two personalities to a collective aesthetic—and that might explain why it’s so cosmic. It may be hard to transcend the spiritual starvation of the fridge and television, but Furfour suggests that the small-scale ego death of a creative friendship is one way to do it.   \"],[22408,\"Croatian Amor’s newest album Love Means Taking Action is the latest entry to the ever-expanding canon of albums that wrestle with the infinite nuances of love. As one of many monikers of Loke Rahbek—a key figure in the Copenhagen punk scene and co-founder of the Posh Isolation label—he explores the idea abstractly, in a fluctuating volley of electronics that communicate everything from ecstasy to despair. Under Croatian Amor, it is the closest he comes to making ambient music, removed from the retro synthpop he plays with Lust for Youth, the power electronics he creates under the LR moniker, or the various explorations of noise he makes in collaboration with Olymphia, Damien Dubrovnik, or Puce Mary. It’s a project that has always been able to balance beauty’s relationship with the ugly. Never has this dichotomy been more present than on Love Means Taking Action, where both of these elements are amplified more than ever before. It’s perfectly displayed in the opening song “An Angel Gets His Wings Clipped” where a solitary, echoing voice sings a stark melody for a solid minute before all the electronics start swelling around it like steam cutting through earth. The give-and-take emerges, and tension begins to consume everything, setting the tone for what’s to come.Love Means Taking Action separates itself from Croatian Amor’s previous work because of its ability to maintain an overall mood among its many smaller shifts. Older works like Genitalia Garden would constantly reset tone between tracks, choosing between a darker or lighter sound. Whereas here a song like “No Sex Club” starts so claustrophobically with single-tone electronics and cut up samples of someone panting, only to give way to bright, piano-like chords that shift the whole tenor of the song, while still keeping the original creeping sensation present in the background. These production changes point toward the greater risks Rahbek is taking here. The vocal slicing and splicing on “Like Angel” are reminiscent of Holly Herndon, and the short piano piece “Nadim Call Emergence II” would never exist on previous releases. Here they not only make sense, but give the more traditional Croatian Amor compositions (“Octopus Web,” “Any Life You Want”) more gravity. These violent contrasts should lead to a complete lack of cohesion. And while the album creates a kind of confusion initially, if this is Rahbek’s attempt to define love, or at least to understand the interaction between other people, then of course there will be odd juxtapositions and gorgeous conflict. But Rahbek ends the album with the title track, one of his prettiest compositions to date, a cheese-filled blossom of skeletal ’80s synths that remains the album’s brightest most cohesive moment as something gorgeous takes hold of everything. It’s as though all the previous chaotic dissonance is a means to arrive, finally, at harmony.\"],[22407,\"It took seven months for the members of Viet Cong to pick a new band name, but it appears to have been time well spent. On their first album as Preoccupations, they live up to their moniker to an almost scary degree, sounding engrossed in thought to the point of pathological obsession. “With a sense of urgency and unease\\/Second guessing just about everything” sings Matt Flegel to open the album, in a song called “Anxiety.” Internal stress marks every track, in phrases like “spinning in a vacuum,” “falling into mania,” “so close to exhaustion,” “overwhelmed, and it’s coming from all angles.” By its words alone, Preoccupations reads like fodder for major therapy.What makes Preoccupations much more than a circular exercise in self-analysis is the vitality of the music. There’s a tense, nervous energy running through all the tracks, which connect to each other like wires that spark electrical currents when they meet. The same could be said of the band’s self-titled album as Viet Cong, which also crackled with highly-concentrated vigor. But there’s something tauter, snappier, and even more melodic about Preoccupations.Maybe it’s that the group has embraced some of their influences more openly. The first Viet Cong EP included a cover of Bauhaus’ “Dark Entries,” but the ghosts of ’80s post-punk are stronger on Preoccupations. The band seems particularly infatuated with the catchier end of that spectrum: many of these bass-driven, shimmering guitar tunes evoke Echo and the Bunnymen, Psychedelic Furs, and Teardrop Explodes. There’s even one super-catchy song, “Stimulation,” that could pass for an early Cure track, albeit updated to fit Preoccupations’ strengths. Its high-speed hooks makes Flegel’s chants of “We’re all dumb inside\\/All dead inside\\/All gonna die” sound positively enthusiastic.Even with tunes as bright as that one, Preoccupations is an intense listen. Flegel’s lyrics are relentlessly dark, laser-focused on heavy, troubling issues. At times, his barks and howls combined with the band’s rhythmic pummeling (one tune is even called “Monotony”) are almost too much to handle, approaching the harrowing feel of early Swans. Take when Flegel sings “You’ve been made irrelevant by a suicide machine\\/Mechanically modified to muffle out the screams” over the stark percussion of “Forbidden.” But throughout Preoccupations, the music’s sharp jolts make Flegel’s words not moribund but full of life. He’s not sitting in a corner feeling sorry for himself, but fighting hard to shed an emotional straitjacket.Whether he ever actually breaks out of his shackles is a moot question, but Preoccupations does end with some success on that count. The record’s prettiest tune, “Fever,” closes the album with the semi-triumphant declaration, “You’re not scared\\/Carry your fever away from here.” Still, the power of Preoccupations lies not in some victory but in the battle. All the wrestling and strife inside these songs are the musical equivalent of blood blasting through veins and nerves raking skin. For Preoccupations, if you’re not struggling, you’re not living.\"],[22312,\"For almost a decade, Robert Glasper has been the standard-bearer for jazz music’s fusion with hip-hop, soul, and rock, turning songs like Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” and Radiohead’s “Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box” into kinetic electro-funk mashups. With his Experiment band, Glasper, vocalist\\/saxophonist Casey Benjamin, drummer Mark Colenburg, and bassist Derrick Hodge tend to leapfrog different genres, making music that’s rooted in jazz and R&B and impossible to peg. “My people have given the world so many styles of music,” Glasper declares at the top of ArtScience, the Experiment’s new album. “So why should I just confine myself to one? We want to explore them all.”ArtScience follows Black Radio 2, the band’s guest-heavy 2013 LP featuring rappers Common, Snoop Dogg and Lupe Fiasco, and singers Jill Scott and Norah Jones, among many others. On it and the band’s first Black Radio album, the Glasper Experiment mostly stayed in the background, giving room to their guests to shine atop the group’s instrumentals. The formula worked: Black Radio won the 2012 Grammy for Best R&B Album, and “Jesus Children”—a Stevie Wonder remake from Black Radio 2, featuring vocalist Lalah Hathaway and actor\\/poet Malcolm-Jamal Warner—won the 2014 Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance. For ArtScience, the Experiment keeps things in-house, handling all the vocal work themselves. Glasper himself sings lead on “Thinkin Bout You” and Benjamin—the group’s de facto lead vocalist—is front and center on “Day to Day,” “Tell Me a Bedtime Story” and “Hurry Slowly.” ArtScience feels less restrained than the Black Radio series—which, after two releases and a separate remix EP—started to feel safe and redundant. So perhaps for that reason, ArtScience doesn’t play like an R&B or jazz record; it pulls in ’80s funk and ’90s soul without landing any place in particular. For the first time, we get to hear the Experiment let go for a full project, not just on a few songs here and there.A romantic tone flows through the album, using lyrics that speak to different stages of affection. “Thinkin Bout You” is a sweet ode to puppy love, a reminder that no matter the circumstance, true devotion can withstand long distance and everyday doldrums. Glasper’s voice is washed in bright synths, bolstering the song’s sentimental aura. On “You and Me,” Benjamin recalls a time when he wasn’t so trusting, when his heart was broken and “locked tight.” But in comes a new love, making everything better: “Can’t explain, what you do\\/How ya do, some kinda mystery.” In years past, the Experiment was more beat-driven; tracks like “Festival” and “Open Mind” emphasized the band’s great instrumental arrangements. The lyrics aren’t overly intricate, but they offer just enough nuance to let the soundtrack remain the focal point. Songs like “Find You” and “Let’s Fall In Love” strive for mainstream acceptance—the former is a hard-charging bounce beat; the latter uses an Auto-Tuned, trap-infused cadence to perhaps pull in younger fans. ArtScience is the Robert Glasper Experiment’s most realized effort, mainly because they’ve stopped relying on outside talent to get their point across. They’ve created their own vibe, one that needed their own voices to truly resonate.\"],[22381,\"Ringgo Ancheta’s come-up story is an increasingly familiar type—the independently educated bedroom producer, influenced by friends and family, whose DIY approach led him towards Los Angeles’ beat scene. What might make that story a bit more curious than others’ is that Ancheta’s path began on a rural New Jersey commune, where he grew up in the ’90s. And in the late ’00s, it brought him to run in a crew called Klipm0de alongside future Kendrick Lamar producer\\/collaborator Knxwledge. The intrigue of those formative experiences is borne out clearly in his music. Mndsgn’s releases, from his contributions to 2011’s Bitches Brew-mutating compilation Blasphemous Jazz to his 2014 headswimmer of a Stones Throw breakthrough Yawn Zen, have darted from reference to reference in a way that would make his next move unpredictable, but he ties them all together in a way that makes perfect sense.Perhaps due to a healthy dose of L.A. sunshine, Body Wash has Mndsgn engaging with classic ’80s R&B and boogie funk. At some points, it sounds as if he’s channelling the synthesized soul of SOLAR Records in-house producer, Leon Sylvers III. It might seem like a big leap from the gleaming, crackling FlyLo-isms of his clanky 2014 work, but Ancheta’s curious, philosophical approach is more than ready for it. Mndsgn emerges here as a sort of koan-dispensing, prog-funk astronaut, and it’s made some of his more tenuous strengths feel a lot more natural.That starts with his voice, typically a restrained, almost introverted murmur that often sounds like he’s scanning for something far on the horizon. Accordingly, Ancheta tends to lean towards themes of self-actualization and human connection in his lyrics. “Cosmic Perspective” and its references to “searching for the right way” and heading for “the land of music” are vintage Zen funk worthy of mid ’70s Lonnie Liston Smith. Even at its clearest, Mndsgn’s voice is an almost detached entity that expresses these realizations as they happen. (When he multitracks his own voice, it sounds like the “ohhhhh” of a person finally getting it.) A running theme, to paraphrase “Ya Own Way,” is getting from where you’re at to where you’re going, whether chronologically, mentally, or geographically. Ancheta holds fast to this idea, offering a means of connection and solidarity through uncertainty.Pairing that sense of direction-seeking with a deep dive into West Coast funk is a natural fit. But Body Wash also refocuses some of his familiar tendencies into new modes. As someone young enough to have dreamed of contributing to Stones Throw before even thinking it was possible, Mndsgn makes clear his debt to the label’s mid-to-late-’00s adventurousness, even as he recombines their sounds into his own thing. Think of the slightly-off-kilter, human-touch rhythms of Dilla, only rerouted to little chirpy synth riffs instead of the drums—or Dâm-Funk with the extended-voyage drifting drawn into more concise sketches.Half the cuts here don’t make it to three minutes, but they still drill into your mind with ease. There’s a three-part “Searchin” suite that runs through a “Shalamar goes to the Moon” masterclass in neo-boogie—you can hear it shift from disco to g-funk to Jam\\/Lewis while still cohering as its own thing—in less than seven minutes. If the elusive destination that Ancheta’s music has been trying to reach turns out to be a 1981 roller-rink party, it’s been a journey well-spent, and only makes the next destination more eagerly anticipated.\"],[22357,\"What’s the common link between Title Fight, Prurient, and Power Trip? Producer Arthur Rizk, now an in-demand name for what Kurt Ballou calls achieving the maximum amount of Satan. Rizk’s status as the underground producer du jour somewhat obscures the fact that he is also a keen student of early ’80s American metal, making work comparable to his masters. In Rizk’s own band Sumerlands, the guitarist has teamed up with former Hour of 13 vocalist Phil Swanson, drummer Justin DeTore of Magic Circle, guitarist John Powers, and bassist Brad Raub (Raub also plays with Rizk in crossover group War Hungry). Sumerlands’ 2014 demo hinted at a worthy update of classic American power\\/speed metal; with their self-titled debut full-length, Rizk establishes himself as a metal songwriting behemoth.Rizk’s most notable productions come from bands who understand how melody can make aggression sound fuller. This is why he’s as comfortable working with shoegaze-obsessed hardcore dudes like Title Fight as he is with Dom Fernow, a master of faltering beauty. Rizk’s ability to hone in on melodies from other bands translates to his own guitar work, drawing especially from Jake E. Lee, Ozzy Osbourne’s guitarist after Randy Rhoads’ death and before Zakk Wylde’s tenure. Lee bridged the gap between Rhoads’ virtuosity and Wylde’s tougher approach, and Rizk imagines Lee unburdened by Ozzy’s need for radio play. “Seventh Seal” opens bursting with jubilant leads, and Swanson comes out charging, grabbing Rizk’s rhythm and bending it at his will. Rizk's changes and DeTore’s stomp are relentless in their catchiness, the stuff guitar hero dreams and European metal festival chants are made of. It’s flashy and tasteful, packing enough to be memorable without going into overload. The two tracks that follow, “The Guardian” and “Timelash,” are bombastic in a different way, with Rizk giving more space to Swanson. He carries the rhythms, and by upping the theatricality just a bit, Rizk’s guitar basks and becomes sneakily majestic. Rizk’s production also serves Sumerlands well, providing a sound as punchy as his rhythms and solos. If there’s one thing no one should miss about the ’80s, it’s albums marred by thin production.Sumerlands builds upon the pre-thrash days, when metal hadn’t absorbed hardcore into its DNA, and yet was still exiting the ’70s with lightspeed. That era has gotten some due thanks to bands like In Solitude and Christian Mistress, but Sumerlands aren’t quite as focused on the comparatively elegant NWOBHM. The album is more influenced by Manilla Road’s Midwestern Viking dreams; a vision as big as, but also contrasting, boring wheat fields. “Blind” and “Spiral Infinite” are rife with speed and aggression, but they don’t come from a punky place. It’s heartier, working-class strength meets liberating curiosity. Energy doesn’t always mean fast. This contrasts with many of DeTore’s other metal projects, which still have hints of his hardcore upbringing. Still, this is not a slick prog-metal affair. Swanson’s voice contains confidence, with a weight that suggests he’s seen some shit. “The Guardian” and “Blind” show his natural ability to ramp himself into a hysteria, just enough so he can return from the other side in one piece. He doesn’t go for piercing highs because Rizk’s wizardry is enough of a high for him—and us.Swanson and Rizk’s chemistry is the heart of Sumerlands’ power: it’s both reverent and ageless. Metal has a weird relationship with age: its technical and physical demands favor younger players, but it’s dominated by old dudes, and even the ones that keep with new bands hold the ’80s as the apex. Aging gracefully is nearly impossible: Metallica’s relevance, for example, has long outpaced their ability to recreate their classics live. Sumerlands isn’t a record for old fans looking to relive their youth, nor is it a placeholder for younger fans with knowledge gaps. It’s an exceptional record, and the barrier to entry isn’t age. It’s whether you can surrender yourself to Rizk’s charm as the new American Heavy Metal Master.\"],[22061,\"In July 1975, Brian Eno found himself a few days and several thousand dollars into a studio booking with nearly nothing to show for it.It wasn’t that he had too few ideas, but too many. His first two solo albums, Here Come the Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain (by Strategy), had reimagined glam rock as sound sculpture and established Eno not just as a practitioner of pop, but a theoretician of it: Someone whose music doubled as a blueprint for how music could be made. In interviews he came off as part drag courtesan and part professor emeritus, scissoring his legs in feathers and sequins while dishing about the thrills of aleatoric composition, shaping ideas few people had heard before into forms anyone could understand.Jets and Tiger Mountain bookended a year—November 1973 to November 1974—during which Eno released three other, collaborative albums. By the end of 1975, he’d release at least two more, including something called Discreet Music, which pioneered the textured drift of what Eno later called “ambient.”At the time he conceived of Discreet Music, just a few months before he found himself panicked on the studio floor, Eno was lying in a London hospital after being hit by a taxi. The story—a modern creation myth—goes that his girlfriend brought him an album of 18th-century harp music, which Eno was too weak to adjust the volume on, exposing him to a blurry, impressionistic convergence of music and light rainfall outside. What if, he thought, you could make music to be heard but not actively listened to? (Or, as Eno later formulated the challenge, music “as ignorable as it is interesting.”) [1] Days earlier, he had been lying in the back of an ambulance, holding his head together with his own bloody hands. Most people who can’t turn their brains off consider it an affliction. Eno accepted it as a gift. Eno, it should be said, had planned on going into the studio without a plan. As an art-school student, he’d fallen in love with Fluxus, a network of sculptors, musicians, performers, and thinkers who privileged the process of making work over the product. In 1968, he won a small school award for his performance of a George Brecht piece called “Drip Event,” whose score, in full, was “Erect containers such that water from other containers drips into them.”Eno, then 20, added instructions for the instruments to be ground down and cast into blocks of acrylic resin, which should be given to young children. “Now,” he stipulated, “the music begins.” Liberated by the idea that there are no right ways, only different ones, Eno performed the piece two more times, each one unrecognizable to the last. Recording, by extension, wasn’t the endpoint of composition but part of composition itself, the studio less a place of stenography than discovery. But record companies don’t buy and sell processes, they buy and sell records. If Fluxus and other performance artists defied the reduction of art to an object, Eno’s ambition was to make records—concrete, immutable, physical records—that reflected process. Discreet Music’s 30-minute centerpiece, a loop of slow, feathery synthesizer tones, fades in at the beginning of the record and out at the end, as though to signal to the listener that whatever Discreet Music is—the physical record, the abstract composition—we’ve only witnessed part of it. “I think I started about 35 pieces and some of ’em were real clutching at straws,” Eno told the NME in 1976, remembering the panic of his studio session. “But it’s interesting: Sometimes that kind of desperation gives rise to things that would never happen any other way.”Unsure of what else to do, Eno started giving himself instructions. Swing the microphone from the ceiling was one. Hire a trombone was another. A year earlier, he and the artist Peter Schmidt developed a set of creative constraints that codified in a deck of cards they called “Oblique Strategies.” Part Fluxus exercise, part I Ching, part high-concept Tarot, the cards presented what Eno and Schmidt called “worthwhile dilemmas,” scenarios artists might pose to themselves while trying to squeeze through a difficult moment.In the spirit of the endeavor, I have just drawn three cards at random. The first says “Look at a very small object, look at its center.” The next, “Feedback recordings into an acoustic situation.” The third “Imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar.” If freedom is darkness, “Oblique Strategies” were a guide rail: You might not know where you were going but at least you could start to move.The real challenge of the Strategies is having the faith to surrender to them. Throughout his 40-year career, which has included producing such marquee enterprises as U2, Talking Heads, and Coldplay, Eno has remained a voluntary amateur, someone who seems most engaged when he isn’t sure what will happen next. More than humor, more than work ethic, more than his ability to see and conceptualize in ways nobody had quite seen and conceptualized before, Eno’s greatest gift was his ability not only to find peace in uncertainty, but progress.Not all Eno’s collaborators shared his sense of play. As told to Geeta Dayal in her book on the album, the bassist Percy Jones remembers him handing out sheets of paper on which musicians were asked to write numbers, which corresponded to a specific note, which Eno wanted them to play on beat with a metronome. Phil Collins—yes, “In the Air Tonight” Phil Collins, then the drummer of Genesis—got about 20 beats in before stopping to throw beer cans at a bicycle across the room. Eno often came home from the studio and cried, later calling the process “almost unmitigated hell.”A couple of months later, they had a placid, reflective and unrepentantly beautiful album called Another Green World. Though usually lumped in with Eno’s other early “vocal” albums—Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (by Strategy), and 1977’s Before and After Science—only five of its 14 songs actually have singing. While Eno could’ve separated the vocal tracks from the instrumental ones, as David Bowie did a couple of years later on the Eno-assisted Low, he instead dispersed them at even intervals, lily pads of song between deeper seas. The effect is like slipping into and out of sleep while friends talk in the next room.As a child, Eno had designed houses, blueprints, sketches for fantastical and improbable places, filled with labyrinths and secret passageways. Trees grew through the middle of rooms, streams ran indoors. Another Green World captures those rooms in sound. Instead of linear, narrative structures that move from A to B to C to convey development, songs like “The Big Ship” start on A and linger, accumulating countermelodies, magnifying themes, staying the same and yet revealing new sides with every turn. The effect is like seeing a two-dimensional image rise off the page and then slowly fall again.In the absence of vocals, Eno’s approach, which he once called “vertical music,” becomes a metaphor for intimacy: With every second that the tracks unfold, you feel like you’re getting closer to the heart of something. That you never arrive doesn’t matter. The joy is in the passage. I’ve often felt like the most famous “Oblique Strategy,” “repetition is a form of change,” is as applicable to my best friendships or my marriage as it is to the creative process: When you see her face every day, the challenge becomes to notice something new.Removing vocals—or at least diminishing their primacy—was Eno’s way of chipping at how we identify the “human” in music. Pop is a diaristic form: A voice telling you their story, seeking identification. In Another Green World, voices ricochet around the mix like people in a busy market (“Sky Saw”) or stumble in the margins, drunk and out of tune (“Golden Hours”). At certain points I get the strange sense that Eno is distracted by something happening at the window, just out of frame. He isn’t commanding the sound around him, he’s inhabiting it. He could just as well leave and everything would be the same.Among Eno’s fascinations at the time was dub reggae, which was entering an enlightenment phase. “You get an album like, say, King Tubby Meets the Upsetter, where on the back of the album you get a picture of the consoles instead of the ‘stars’,” he said in a 1975 interview. The image—instead of the band, pictures of their equipment—articulated Eno’s developing attitude that musicians are only as important as the way they’re organized and processed. (One of Eno’s other big bang moments had been with “Come Out,” by the composer Steve Reich, a hypnotic piece in which two nearly identical tape loops of a human voice slowly fall out of phase with each other then slide back together—music whose effect depended entirely on the technology used to make it.)The most remarkable thing about Another Green World, then, is how a stoic Englishman who showed no interest in the conventional expression of emotion managed to make something that feels so intensely personal.Eno grew up in a small, parochial town in postwar England, the son of a third-generation mailman and a Catholic woman from Belgium. Aside from occasional streaks of melancholy, young life was steady and unremarkable. “My great debt to my parents is that they showed little interest in what I was doing,” he told People in 1982. His first love was doo-wop, the lunar reverberation of echo and percussive babble of backup singers, the uncanny mix of carnal yearning and pure naiveté, of lust without sex. (Talking to the writer Lester Bangs in 1979, he called it “music from nowhere.”)The impact lingered. The daffy, nonsensical love poetry of “I’ll Come Running,” the sha-la-las of its backup singers. “Everything Merges With the Night,” which opens with the plaintive address to a girl named “Rosalie,” the talk of waiting all summer, all evening. You can see Eno on the corner outside her house under a halo of weird orange streetlight, picking up a pebble to toss at her window. Even some of Another Green World’s instrumental tracks, particularly “Becalmed” and “In Dark Trees,” have the eerie aura of something like Elvis’ “Blue Moon,” at once grounded and hovering three feet overhead.Another Green World is not a happy record, nor is it sad. There are no demonstrations of personal triumph or failure, pain or elation, tension or release, desire or disappointment. The album’s most dazzling passage, the guitarist Robert Fripp’s solo on “St. Elmo’s Fire,” was made under Eno’s direction to replicate the display of a Wimshurst machine, a generator that creates lightning-like sparks that jump between two metal spheres. Set in the context of the song, a long walk between Eno and his companion “Brown Eyes,” the solo—electricity across the sky—becomes a point of shared beauty, something neither of them expected to see but that overtakes them both. This is the nature of Another Green World’s romance: Not what one person does or says for another, but the bond created between two people bearing witness to something bigger than both of them: Not love but wonder.As someone who has frequently found themselves in states of deep peace only to have someone ask me if anything was wrong, Another Green World’s apparent neutrality has always been a lifeline to me. Of course, I don’t hear it as neutral—I hear it as ecstatically calm, an album that by some mysterious grace managed to climb just a few rungs higher on the tower and get a more sympathetic look at what it all means. Though self-consciously not a hippie, Eno seemed to understand that the real promise of psychedelic drugs wasn’t to push one’s thoughts into a new beyond but to restore them to a place they hadn’t been since childhood: Drifting but absorbed, naïve but curious, moving laterally, freely, safely. In doo-wop parlance, this was his slow dance with the universe.“I read a science fiction story a long time ago where these people are exploring space and they finally find this habitable planet,” he said to the NME, reflecting on the album’s title. “And it turns out to be identical to Earth in every detail. And I thought that was the supreme irony: that they’d originally left to find something better and arrived in the end—which was actually the same place. Which is how I feel about myself. I’m always trying to project myself at a tangent and always seem eventually to arrive back at the same place.” In other words, here.[1] “Most of the quotes and anecdotes in this piece came from either David Sheppard’s On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno, Geeta Dayal’s Another Green World, or interviews documented on Eno’s fansite.”\"],[22293,\"Mac Miller isn’t the Divine Feminine. The Pittsburgh keg-stander turned style-sampling artisan isn’t making a play at defining femininity. This isn’t an attempt to examine feminism in any way. He isn’t being facetious or woke. In fact, he doesn’t even try to explore what being a woman is like in any sense in any of these texts. The Divine Feminine, a concept record of sorts in distinct contrast to September 2015’s GO:OD AM, is an album about love as it relates to the female form and beyond, as Miller has referred to it, “the feminine energy of the planet.” It broaches smaller, bite-sized topics revolving around romance and connection in an attempt to understand the universe at large, bringing to mind a quote from Carl Sagan’s 1985 sci-fi novel Contact: “For small creatures such as we the vastness [of the universe] is bearable only through love.”When Miller talks about The Divine Feminine, he considers the universe, the distance between persons, and deciphering love on an ideological level. He’s mentioned playing the record for a couple and slowly observing them cut the distance between each other in a room as it progresses. “I want people to put on the record and it’s a date in itself,” he told i-D. “I want people to love to this record and realize they can love to it.” There’s a very real connective tissue to these ideas of space and intimacy. It’s about contact and togetherness, closing the gap between people; about being in unison and growing apart, and all the stages in between. It peels back and exposes the many layers of love—romantic, schmaltzy, sensual, carnal, wilting. It’s easily his most intoxicating release yet, an odyssey of soulful compositions paring down his expansive and eclectic soundboard from the last few years into something distinctly cozy and pleasant. Mac Miller has put in hard work establishing himself as a Serious Rapper since the release of his emotionally and sonically flat debut Blue Slide Park, putting on his fair share of wordplay showcases and aligning himself with the right people since his sprawling breakout Watching Movies With the Sound Off in 2013, but much of that work came off as pandering or, worse still, overly earnest. He’s gotten more comfortable in his own skin with each release, but that threatened to be an issue here, given the title. Yet, The Divine Feminine is by far the most settled he's ever been. There aren’t any plays to satisfy or ingratiate a specific subgroup of listeners. There aren’t any lyrical exercises or overthought exhibitions of verse structure and execution, no plays to prove himself a rapper’s rapper—frankly there’s almost more singing than rapping. But this is his most nuanced release, a record that forgoes personal narrative and somehow reveals his individuality in the process. He does it all with just a little help from his friends.The album interlocks a diverse array musicians without losing the main thematic thread. The fingerprints of his sonic soulmate Ariana Grande are all over the record: backup vocals, feature vocals, voiceover work, and her positive influence on him shows. Cee-Lo Green lends his unmistakable vocals and energy to “We,” which simmer just above the surface of crisp drum kicks. Miller and Kendrick move in tandem on the epic closer “God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty” without any competitive tension. Students from Juilliard played strings on the album, and they accent the arrangements well. He even gets noted lothario Ty Dolla $ign to play a gentleman (or at least as close to that as he gets) on “Cinderella,” which is no easy task.As a group, led by Miller’s pronounced vision, they forge the lover’s guide to the universe, painting in tiny brush strokes from a warm and familiar tonal palette. The Divine Feminine has very specific set of sonic reference points: the rich and heavy funk of Anderson .Paak’s Malibu, flexed into with help from Dâm-Funk and .Paak himself on tracks like “Dang!”; flecks of the Social Experiment’s juke and jazz (especially on “Stay”); even the electro-fused alt R&B of a producer like Kaytranada. It’s heavily indebted to the growing fusion jazz rap movement with contributions from pianist Robert Glasper, Brainfeeder bass maestro Thundercat, and trumpeter Keyon Harrold, sometimes appearing in the record’s margins, but usually as full-fledged performers (the first two also played on To Pimp a Butterfly). The Divine Feminine reins in Mac Miller’s wide-ranging taste, bonding aesthetics and fully realizing his artistry.It’s worth noting that The Divine Feminine has the fewest tracks of any Mac Miller album and that it is the clearest, most concise record of his career; that’s a correlation, not a coincidence. The project started as an EP, but it became a full album as Miller continued to flesh out its ideas. Across its 10 songs, it observes love as a part of the human experience without forcing any beliefs on the listener, dealing mostly in the building blocks of feelings. “Dang!” and “Stay” play back-to-back and examine loss of love close up. The Grande duet, “My Favorite Part,” is basically the downtempo reprise of One Direction’s “What Makes You Beautiful.” The album’s emotional and sonic center is “Planet God Damn,” about becoming vulnerable, a sentiment echoed by Njomza on the hook: “Tell the truth\\/Show me you.” As the closer, “God Is Fair, Sexy Nasty,” trails off into Glasper piano chords, a widow recounts how she fell in love with her husband, punctuating her story with a mantra: “How important it is to love, respect, and care for each other.” That kind of union is something Miller clearly strives for, something he calls “the best love story in the world.” The Divine Feminine doesn’t just chase that, it bottles the very essence.\"],[22310,\"According to all eyewitness accounts, Julius Eastman was hard to ignore. He was lithe, he had a five-octave voice and an improviser’s intelligence at the piano. When he was healthy, Eastman was sought out by famed conductor Pierre Boulez. He played jazz in a combo that frequented clubs in Buffalo, contributed synths and vocals to an experimental disco outfit organized by Arthur Russell, and sang in early groups led by Meredith Monk. As a queer African-American member of the avant-garde, he cut a unique figure in the 1970s by necessity. Composer and trombonist George Lewis remembers that, to him, Eastman represented “a singular figure of presence” in those years, since “black artists were far less in evidence in the Downtown New York music scene than queer ones.”While in the company of such elites, Eastman challenged the norms of etiquette with a potency that guaranteed scandal. His explicit, queer reframing of John Cage’s Song Books famously enraged Cage himself. And Eastman’s confrontational “nigger series” of compositions—including pieces like Nigger Faggot, Crazy Nigger, and Evil Nigger—were sometimes truncated on concert bills, due to pressure from well-meaning protestors and risk-averse programmers. These were moves that obscured Eastman’s stated desire to face up to “that thing which is fundamental” in American society. He contained so much art and vision as to be a scene unto himself. Then he faded from view. After alienating lovers and collaborators alike, Eastman was evicted from his apartment in the mid-’80s. Most of his scores were bagged and carted away—eventually lost to history. Details from his homeless period are sketchy (or contested), but it’s generally agreed that he lived in Tompkins Square Park and also suffered from some form of addiction. After he died, alone in a Buffalo hospital at age 49, it took eight months for an obituary to be published. Eastman can be almost as fascinating to read about as he is to listen to. Yet for a long time, hardly anyone pursued either activity—largely because much of his music had been scattered to the winds prior to his death in 1990. Thankfully, the last decade has seen a renaissance in Eastman appreciation. Contemporaries like Kyle Gann and Mary Jane Leach have pooled rare recordings and fragments of scores, and found new material in archives. In 2005, a three-CD set on New World Records, Unjust Malaise, brought several of Eastman’s most notorious compositions into wide circulation. Jace Clayton reinterpreted two of those works on a 2013 album. And along with Renée Levine Packer, Leach has edited an important book of essays covering every aspect of Eastman’s career. Still, the primary stumbling block to any greater revelry has been a lack of recorded evidence of Eastman’s own performances.The release of Femenine, however, is an occasion for wide celebration. In terms of sonic fidelity, this is an occasionally scratchy live recording of a chamber orchestra performance from November 6, 1974, with Eastman at the piano. In creative terms, it’s a crystal-clear, 72-minute shot that reaffirms what all the veteran scholars and performers have been talking about for decades. Though it doesn’t offer an expansive look at his compositional growth like Unjust Malaise, it gives us a better sense of Eastman as a bandleader and performer of his own works. Better than any recording currently circulating, it’s on Femenine that listeners can get a sense of how Eastman fused jazz-informed improvisation with the rigors of early, pulse-based minimalism. And there is also a suggestion of Eastman’s humor—an attribute sometimes overshadowed by the seriousness of his politics and the tragedy of his death. The first sound you hear on this recording is an audience casually settling down. And then there is laughter, as a performer switches on a mechanical device that shakes sleigh bells. In an era before drum programming, inhuman percussion had a jokey, improbable tinge. Artists in the Fluxus movement outfitted a violin with a rod-twirling motor that slapped away like the meekest torture device imaginable.For Femenine, Eastman’s machine automated the shaking of sleigh bells for the entirety of the performance. It can be read as both a Fluxus-style joke on the stark rhythmic processes of Philip Glass and Steve Reich, as well as an assumption of that sound into the overall Eastman palette. That Eastman could simultaneously be a prankster and a skilled style-scout was one aspect of his genius; whereas he’d copped R&B textures for a prior composition, Stay on It, with Femenine, Eastman was scouring his avant-garde contemporaries for inspiration. He gave as much as he took, too. As Leach told the musician and writer David Menestres, Femenine offers “the fluidity of jazz and a swing that is missing from, especially, Reich.”In the recording’s opening minutes, Eastman plays a few chords and notes as the other members of the chamber ensemble tune up. Before too long, the piece begins in earnest with a catchy vibraphone line: one that starts with fast, one-note repetition, before ascending in see-saw fashion up a narrow interval. Along with the bells’ rhythm, this vibraphone motif—both optimistic and energetic—is the backbone of the piece. Aside from that, it’s up to Eastman and the other members of his orchestra to sustain the audience’s interest over the next hour. The length of the performance was a grid that Eastman used to guide his ensemble’s improvisations. Each member had a digital clock, as well as brief passages of scored material that corresponded to a particular minute-mark in the performance. Choices left up to individual performers might have to do with octave placement, or with the selection of a given note from a particular chord. Another direction in the score is more explicit: “pianist will interrupt.” Like other minimalists, Eastman knew how to get a lot of mileage out of means that look scant on the page. Overall, the assembled string and wind players can hang with Eastman—an impressive feat, since this performance included some players who were much less familiar with the composer than others. There are brief fumbles in the ensemble, at some points, but nothing that can derail the performance, as it’s Eastman who holds everything together at the piano. Over time, it’s the intuitive authority of his largely improvised piano part that emerges as the major attraction of this set. He stays in the background during the initial playing, allowing that vibraphone part to really carve out a space in the listener’s consciousness. Once that hypnotic effect is achieved, Eastman starts pulling from his personal dictionary of styles and influences, all while staying relatively close to the melodic material he gave to the other players. Femenine was an early example of Eastman’s “organic music” concept—a version of minimalism which allowed for all previously played material to be present in later stages of a performance. Years after this gig, Eastman would tell an audience that he was still trying to perfect this approach. But there are hints of his success with it here, thanks to a steady accretion of ideas that never throws Femenine off balance. Ten minutes in, there are strong hints of the blues coming from Eastman’s piano. Soon after, he steadily adds new chords to a jazzy, rollicking piano line that syncopates with the vibraphone theme.  Gradually, the harmony is built out to a point of richness that recalls Romantic-era classical composers. After nearly half an hour, the flute player of the S.E.M. Ensemble works in tandem with Eastman on an extended, ascending progression. A quarter of an hour later, when Eastman shifts down several octaves, he creates a massively booming, bass-heavy crunch. While he manages to put the recording a little in the red, the intensity and volume of this choice can’t obliterate the essential joy of Femenine.Remembrances of the show included in this album’s liner notes inform us that Eastman appeared in a dress for the concert. The audience was also served soup. That convivial group spirit is alive on this recording, even at its loudest or roughest edges. The piece’s semi-notated structure and expanded performance timeframe present a question of genre that is pointedly never resolved. But the force of Eastman’s performance shows his own mastery of this ambiguity. His spirit of offering isn’t merely strong enough to survive the openness of the form, it is enhanced by this radical flexibility.Though never intended as an album as such, the first appearance of Femenine is nonetheless a major landmark in both Eastman’s posthumous narrative and the story of the American avant-garde. In the recent scholarly volume edited by Packer and Leach, there is a tantalizing list of other Eastman-led performances, currently available only at the music library of the University of Buffalo. The artistic value of this archival release—imperfect sonics and all—begs for an arrangement that will make the rest of Eastman’s genius widely accessible.\"],[22398,\"Bryce Dessner is, if only to those attuned to the new-classical world, no longer just a rock’n’roll tourist in the world of major orchestral commissions. For the past five or so years, Dessner has premiered a few major works every year and demonstrated a breadth of musical vision that goes well beyond the expected post-minimalist gambits of the “crossover classical” composer. To the art-music world, a Deutsche Grammaphon recording of a multi-movement orchestral suite might have signalled that Dessner meant business. To a larger chunk of music fans, it might have been his involvement with the Ryuichi Sakamoto-helmed soundtrack for Oscar shoe-in The Revenant that singled that this classical stuff wasn’t just a dalliance.In collaboration with his brother and bandmate Aaron, Bryce has now created intimate and modest music for an even more intimate and modest movie. There are similarities between Transpecos and The Revenant: like Alejandro Iñárritu’s unsparing epic, director Greg Kwedar’s feature film debut—a tale of three border patrol agents in Texas whose lives are derailed forever by the illicit contents in the trunk of car—traces a few men’s battle against cruel fate and crueller nature. A festival favorite this year and another among the ever-widening ranks of straight-to-VOD critically lauded indie films, Transpecos is a testament to what a filmmaker can do with the bare minimum in terms of set pieces, climactic action, and performance forces.The Dessner brothers, in turn, limit their resources as well. Their interplay on the soundtrack (released by indie soundtrack label Milan Records) often resembles their dynamic in the National: an effects-laden rhythm-and-lead relationship, often between a precisely fingerpicked acoustic and sighing, slightly blurry electric guitar figures. It’s much less intricate than Bryce’s recent work, but the musical vocabulary and emotional scope is just as diverse. It’s also a big step forward from the brothers’ themes for the 2013 Kerouac adaptation of Big Sur. Chord-organ synth surges and controlled feedback overwhelm the muted guitar rhythms, lending colossal weight to Kwedar’s wide shots of endless desert. At moments, the Dessners’ response to the source text is a bit knee-jerky. The tracks are heavy on guitar effects (whammy bars, heavy tremolo, weeping slide guitar figures) that conjure a distinctly Western patois (look no further than the track “Cowboys”). But then again, this is a genre film that asks for such things, a Border noir. These are semi-winking diversions along the way, not the lifeblood of the soundscape. Like the film, the soundtrack slows and softens in the third act, becoming all pointillistic guitar, violin notes, and gritty, seething ambience. Hints of folksiness and pop harmony disappear as the three officers accept their grim lot and contemplate the eternal. The spare music mirrors their desolation—sometimes the ruthless phantoms they are hobbling frantically away from, sometimes a vain twinge of hope. Moments like these show that the Dessners as a composing\\/performing unit have built their reputation not only from developing melodic and rhythmic interchanges, but for finding unexpected ways to shade them.Though they make for the most interesting cues in the film, these more glacial compositions (the lengthy “Chase” and “Man Down,” in particular) don’t work as well apart from the images, as many are choreographed fairly specifically to beats in the script. But they pay tribute to the Dessners’ real gift as programmatic composers: their ability to play both to and against the dramatic moment when the time feels right. The true power of this music can only be fully felt in context, but that is, after all, what it was designed for. The Dessners understand their relatively slight role. In the context of ethereal modern film scores, they create something both familiar and, in its deployment, unexpected.\"],[22403,\"Ezale is a human emoji. He’s always smiling, dancing, or on fire in some way that swirls his thin braids around. When he burst onto the rap scene in 2013 behind “5 Minutes of Funktown”—an intersection between nostalgic beats from Whodini and Rick James and dumb Oakland swagger—he felt less like a rapper and more like a giddy tour guide. When he collected that world-building origin story and other great singles “Foreal Foreal” and “Too High,” he put on the appropriate costume and titled his 2013 mixtape Drug Funnie, a riff on the Nickelodeon show “Doug.” On the cover of his collaboration album with DJ Fresh, The Tonite Show, Ezale and Fresh share detailed, slightly grotesque Adult Swim-type caricatures. DJ Fresh is an old-fashioned DJ who loves making music. He crisscrosses influences into a funky, pastel patchwork that reflects the diversity of Oakland and growing up surrounded by every type of music (never mind that DJ Fresh is actually an East Coast transplant). He builds common ground between Bay Area slap and G-funk through ’80s sounds, connecting the dots from soft rock to quiet storm, adult contemporary pop, disco, and new jack swing. While some of Fresh’s Tonite Show albums have drawn attention by featuring artists who would seem incongruent (like Gary, Indiana’s Freddie Gibbs and Houston’s Trae tha Truth), not since D-Lo has Fresh worked with someone as unique and compelling as Ezale, a talent complementary to his own.DJ Fresh productions are a perfect stage for feeling out the sound of words, and while Ezale doesn’t lift off into the gumbo of slang that Bay Area rappers are sometimes known for, his personality is similarly airy and charming, the guy at the party who wants to ask you if you got any pills, not if your friend is single. “Used to bust down zits, now I ship out packs,” he offers on “Stop Come On,” and it’s a great, self-deprecating image and sneaky clever, a dynamic that a lot of rappers, even ones who are trying to be funny, fail miserably at. He’s never hateful or mean, because Ezale is just knocking words back and forth until he finds a joke he likes or a bit of wordplay he can slide into (“I need green bags like Sun Chips\\/I can’t afford to go to Rita off some dumb shit,” from the introspective “Got the Game From the OG’s”)True to most Tonite Show records, this one moves at a clip. Fellow Oakland producer Hawk Beatz takes the reins on a few songs to switch it up, most notably by sampling another Bay Area figure Jocelyn Enriquez and her jam “A Little Bit of Ecstasy,” finding Fresh’s bloodline within the slinky beats of ’90s electro. Ezale gets quietly poignant, breaking the fourth wall to hit you with, “My brother coulda made it to the NBA\\/But it didn’t go his way\\/But don’t worry, one day,” and “Livin’ life in the Town make it hard to pray\\/cause they say a stray bullet took my brother away.” Everything that works on the sub-half-hour Tonite Show is contained in “We Want Some Pussy,” a terrific end-of-summer song that prominently samples 2 Live Crew but takes the energy level down a few notches, not even riding a swing-for-the-fences beat that you might conceive while thinking of marrying Miami bass with Oakland slap. It’s this kind of subtle stylistic switch-up that is so compelling—how many different ways can these guys convince you they want some drugs, they want to fuck, they want to party—and how many different ways can it sound great? The answer to both: a lot.\"],[22397,\"Cymbals Eat Guitars’ 2009 debut album Why There Are Mountains arrived at the very tail end of indie-rock’s halcyon days when it was still possible for a new band to earn a fast following just by doing the whole Built to Spill\\/Modest Mouse\\/Pixies thing well. That’s not to say they didn’t deserve their success. They were always more than the sum of their influences, considerably craftier and less predictable than most of the era’s ’90s enthusiasts. But as the public’s appetite for meat-and-potatoes indie rock waned, the band found that their fast rise didn’t buy them much loyalty. The group’s prickly yet exhilarating 2011 follow-up Lenses Alien demanded more from listeners than most were willing to give, and although their more immediate, emotional knockout punch of a third record LOSE seemed like a prime candidate for a second breakthrough, its reach didn’t live up to they hype. For all the accolades, as the band bluntly told Spin, “It didn’t sell.”And so now a band that once stumbled into an audience now finds themselves scraping for one, a cruel reversal of fortunes for a group that’s making the best music of their career. But perhaps timing could work in their favor again. The emo revival has created a home for loud, openhearted guitar rock that skirts conventional notions of “cool,” and although Cymbals Eat Guitars aren’t by any means a complete match for that scene, circumstances have aligned the two. The band spent the two brief years between LOSE and their fourth album Pretty Years on the road with acts like Say Anything, Brand New, and Modern Baseball, so it may not be entirely a coincidence that Pretty Years, while holding true to its own distinctive aesthetic vision, confronts the same vital concerns that have made the best albums from emo’s modern crop resonate so deeply. Like recent works from The Hotelier and Sorority Noise, it’s about nothing less than the intrinsic value of being alive.Some of those leaders of emo’s fourth wave have gone so far as to cast their music as a kind of support group, recording albums that double as manuals for coping with hardship. Pretty Years stops short of that. Despite the comparatively upbeat outlook of these songs—a shift that’s underscored by the album’s jaunty tempos—words of comfort don’t come naturally to singer Joseph D’Agostino. He spent much of Cymbals Eat Guitars’ grief-sick last album processing the death of a close friend, so even as he looks to better days here, he remains guarded and deeply skeptical of any good fortune. “It's as much of a declaration of love as I’ll ever muster,” he trills on “Close.” He’s trying to channel Robert Smith’s heavenly sigh, but his words don’t soar the way Smith’s do. His rasp imparts even his sweetest sentiments with a crotchety sting. “Can’t believe the shit that we were promised really might exist,” he marvels on “Have a Heart,” but it takes the song’s twinkling, Johnny Marr-esque guitars to confirm that, no, he’s not being sarcastic. He really is in love.Every Cymbals Eat Guitars album has been dense, but none have covered as much ground as effectively as Pretty Years. With the help of producer John Congleton, who continues his remarkable streak of bringing out the best in nearly every act he works with, the band nods to some of the wilder arrangements of ’80s pop-rock records like Born in the U.S.A., Brothers in Arms, and Head on the Door. Jubilant E Street Band saxophones cut against D’Agostino’s voice on “Wish,” while the pumping “4th of July, Philadelphia (SANDY)” charges forward with the pageantry and sparkle of a lost Sandinista! gem. Pretty Years’ colorful arrangements keep the mood light even when the subject matter is anything but. On “Well,” bright Duran Duran synths soften the blow of D’Agostino’s harrowing confession: “Think I need help\\/Wanna get well.”So D’Agostino still has some things to work through, even if he’s come a long way from the days of hyperventilating at the prospect of dirty hypodermic needles hidden in movie theater seat cushions. The terrible thing about anxiety, as anybody who’s ever suffered it can attest, is that there’s no permanent fix for it. It does get better over time, maybe even better than you could have hoped, yet you can never be certain that it isn’t still there, hiding dormant somewhere in your chest, waiting to throw off your heartbeat at the least expected moment. On the closer “Shrine,” D’Agostino confronts it head on, testing his progress by joining the family of his deceased friend for a meal commemorating his birthday. That prospect might have thrown him into fits just an album ago, but here things go about as well as you could hope, given the circumstances. “We laugh and drink and eat,” D’Agostino sings, “but we’re all just wishing you were here.” It’s not quite a happy ending, but it’s a fitting final anecdote for an album that so movingly testifies to the difficulty of appreciating what you have while still reconciling what you’ve lost.\"],[22359,\"Touché Amoré have been around for just under a decade, but they’ve already ascended from stalwarts of the Long Beach punk community, to flag-bearers of the American post-hardcore renaissance, to the heaviest band managed by Roc Nation. They’ve shared stages with heavy-hitters like Converge and AFI, and even played Jay Z’s Made in America festival last month alongside Rihanna, Coldplay, and Lil Wayne. Anyone who’s heard Touché’s racket—a leaden mix of serrated guitar leads, head-spinning tempos, and frontman Jeremy Bolm’s impassioned screams—knows that it’s not exactly poppy; but what the band lack in a universally-adored sound, they make up for twice-over with timeless themes.Bolm’s hyper-confessional lyrics are a beacon of hope to anyone plagued by anxiety, depression, toxic relationships, and general self-doubt. Touché’s journey is Bolm’s journey, and the band’s output thus far has belied the stereotypical arc where the frontman battles then conquers his demons. Their first two albums, 2009’s …To The Beat Of A Dead Horse and 2011’s Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me, showed a man at war with himself, struggling to navigate relationships personal and artistic amid anxiety's unyielding fog. Two years later, on 2013’s ambitious Is Survived By, he appeared on the precipice of climbing out of that pit of doubt. “It’s not for nothing, but I’ve seen a transformation,” he reported on “Social Caterpillar,” “Like I consider my happiness for the first time in ages.” And then it all fell apart. On Halloween 2014, in a cramped concert hall in Gainesville, Florida where Touché Amoré were performing as part of annual punk blowout The Fest, Bolm received word from his family back in California that his mother Sandy had died following a long battle with cancer. Understandably, the loss—and the fact that he couldn’t be by Sandy’s bedside when she passed away—tore him to shreds. When one of your parents dies, you never really recover; all you can do is sift through the memories and hold tight to the ones that make you smile. Or you can write an album about it, which brings us to Stage Four, Touché Amoré’s best album.Grief gathers its strength from fine details: childhood memories, sun-faded postcards, the box of Cheez-Its that never got thrown away. It’s difficult to render those artifacts as universal truths, especially to those who have been lucky (or young) enough to have avoided the experience. Stage Four definitely doesn’t have that problem. Instead, its vivid imagery, anthemic arrangements, and unsuspecting listenability position it as hardcore’s Carrie & Lowell: an autobiographical tragedy that soars in spite of an overwhelming urge to succumb.Whereas past albums have traditionally tasked guitarists Clayton Stevens and Nick Steinhart with all of the heavy lifting, wedding every syllable that falls forth from their leader’s mouth to a ragged note, Stage Four sees Bolm taking a stronger melodic initiative. Roughly one-third of the album’s tracks bear his abyssal murmur, a hoarse monotone landing somewhere between Kurt Cobain and Gregorian monk. His clean vocals on “Water Damage” and “Palm Dreams” are unlikely to earn him a spot on The Voice, but it’s to the band’s benefit: There’s still plenty of room for Stevens and Steinhart to churn out the heavy riffs. The remaining space is filled up by Bolm's memories, expressed invariably with blunt, self-scrutinizing detail. On “Eight Seconds,” he recalls the exact moment he learned of his mother’s passing, conjuring the moment painfully and cumulatively, gasp by gasp: “A missed call with a message attached\\/‘We need to talk when you have a chance’\\/I stood frozen in that Gainesville venue\\/Not knowing how to react.’” By the next track (“Palm Dreams”), he’s back in California at his childhood home, sorting through his mother's belongings in solitude (“I dug through 40 years\\/All alone\\/On my own”) and lamenting his failure to address “the questions that went unasked\\/That appear when time has passed”–namely, how Sandy came to arrive in California at the first place. After an extensive guilt-trip, he vows to “find connections through extensions” (this album, perhaps?) and commends anyone on the listening end who’s experienced a similar hell: “It’s a rite of passage\\/It’s a torch to carry\\/When you feel that damage\\/And it’s extraordinary.” Melodic shifts and thematic focus notwithstanding, Stage Four isn’t too far removed from the turbulent post-hardcore showcased on Is Survived By, a similarity largely owed to the production: muffled guitar roaring in the front, staccato cymbals clattering in the back, whirling feedback throughout. Both albums were produced by Brad Wood, famed sonic architect behind Liz Phair’s Exile in Guyville and Sunny Day Real Estate’s Diary, two similarly confessional classics. His mix for closer “Skyscraper,” a devastating duet with folk balladeer Julien Baker, which juxtaposes the duo’s whispered, steadily-strengthening pleas for closure with a phased, shoegaze-y backdrop. Intimacy meets infinity.At last, they clamber back up from rock bottom to the literal top of the world. The album concludes atop a Manhattan skyscraper late one night, as Bolm gazes out at the bright urban sprawl 102 stories below. A few minutes before, on “Water Damage”, the man had declared that he’d yet to recover. But as he stands as close as he can to a heaven he wants so desperately to believe in, he realizes the sheer scope of it all—New York City, life, death, art—and finds comfort in it. “You live there, under the lights,” he observes, Baker’s angelic coos not far behind. “New York City\\/It’s all yours.” He's brought his mother back to life as both a saint of the infinite city and a crucible of hope for the rest of us. \"],[22365,\"In terms of homemade instruments, Silver Apples’ oscillator-synth contraption, known as “the Simeon,” remains undersung. It has never gotten as much attention as the theremin, Harry Partch’s ensembles, Os Mutantes’ fuzz pedal, or Glenn Branca’s third bridge guitars. Operated by telegraph keys and foot pedals, the Simeon was more an ad hoc construction of weirdly humming parts than a functioning instrument. Its vibrating chrome shadow blended perfectly into the pop elation of Silver Apples’ recordings. Unplayable by anybody besides its namesake inventor, it disappeared into the lunar mists when the band dissolved in the early ’70s.Heard now, the band’s two ’60s albums don’t channel psychedelia as much as the hard-wired promise of the space age. Undeniably pop, inventor and songwriter Simeon Coxe’s songs were playful and soulful and cosmic, and—outside the New York underground—fairly sunken on their original release. Somehow unrelated to rock‘n’roll, “I Have Known Love” and others were more like open-hearted show-stoppers arranged for the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Returning to the Simeon in 1996, Coxe revived the Silver Apples for a few years of albums and collaborations and tours. During one of the latter, Coxe broke his neck in a van accident, rethinking and stripping down the Simeon upon his recovery.Now 78, Coxe (professionally, just “Simeon”) and the spirit of his invention return for Clinging to a Dream, the first Silver Apples LP since the instrument and its creator’s reconstructions. At the core of the album, Coxe pilots his electronics towards beautiful and strange-colored waters. The opener “The Edge of Wonder” floats on omniscient myth-chants not dissimilar to Brian Eno’s Another Green World. At its best, Coxe pairs a wide-eyed sweetness with far-out electronics, as on “Fractal Flow,” where a nearly Vaudevillian melody keeps the space age alive and twinkling. Other pieces, like “Colors,” are rich and overt tone poems.On “Susie,” a bouncing portal to a parallel universe of Radiophonic pop, Simeon finds an all-new future, like an algorithm-generated number for a food-obsessed A.I. pop star. But elsewhere, the future sounds a little too much like the present. On the bubbling “Concerto for Monkey and Oscillator,” the new-fangled beats overwhelm its tender oddity, sounding like an avatar-less Soundcloud account pumping synth jams into the ether (and probably with some Silver Apples elsewhere on its playlists).Despite Silver Apples’ hiatus, Coxe hasn’t been inactive, most lately releasing 2013’s Amphibian Lark, a self-titled debut by a new duo. When he performs solo, Coxe’s new set-up finds him returning, at times, to the mysterious place that made the band’s original albums so appealing. But much of Clinging to a Dream finds him exploring sounds beyond the means of his original unwieldy oscillators. The results aren’t always as compelling, but one can sense the liberation in his new means of expression. Clinging to a Dream is a Silver Apples album in every way, but it rarely achieves the fully enveloping richness of some of the band’s ’90s work, which included 1999’s Spectrum collaboration A Lake of Teardrops as well as 1998’s Decatur—a full 42-minutes of oscillators and, in retrospect, an accidental requiem for the Simeon itself.While Simeon and original drummer Danny Taylor once soundtracked the Moon landing during a giant free concert in Central Park, the Silver Apples of the 21st century are making music in a very different future. The new model Apples don’t always achieve liftoff, but Simeon still possesses the coordinates for dazzling new places.\"],[22358,\"The improvising jazz duo is a potent form, offering chances for dialogue, battle, and confluence. There’s immediate pressure on both players since neither can hide, so the opportunity to create tense, vital music is palpable. This seems especially true for piano and drum collaborations, since the piano—more so than horns or strings—is often a percussive instrument, and thus can intersect and connect with drums in unique ways.On Cactus, drummer Bobby Kapp and pianist Matthew Shipp take advantage of the possibilities inherent in their setup, persistently passing ideas back and forth in a wordless conversation. The quality level matches the participants’ pedigrees. Kapp came up in the middle of the ’60s free jazz groundswell, playing with saxophone legends Pharoah Sanders, Marion Brown, and Noah Howard. Shipp, meanwhile, has been a mainstay in New York’s improvising scene since the mid-’80s, best known for his work alongside bassist William Parker in saxophonist David S. Ware’s quartet.Yet Cactus represents only the second time Kapp and Shipp have recorded together—following 2015’s Kapp-led quartet album Themes 4 Transmutation—and they had never played as a duo until they pushed the record button on this fully-improvised session. Given that level of unfamiliarity, their quick reaction time and thoughtful interplay are impressive. The pair lock in immediately and never lose their keen eye-to-eye focus, engaging in such thorough dialogue that it’s hard to find a moment where one isn’t responding to the other.The responses that Kapp draws out of Shipp are some of the latter’s most percussive playing on record. There has always been a heavy rhythmic bent to the pianist’s music, but here he’s so inspired by Kapp’s versatile work that at times it sounds like he wants to be a second drummer. Passages in the rolling “Money” and the meditative “After” find Shipp tapping chords between Kapp’s snare strikes in an impromptu call-and-response. In other spots, the pair’s exchanged pulses shift into less orderly flights, such as when Shipp’s hard-beat notes dissolve into Kapp’s cymbal runs on the gripping “Before.”That last example demonstrates the most compelling aspect of Cactus: the duo’s precise tonal control. Kapp and Shipp move from calm to urgent to portentous in single turns of musical phrase, bringing a wide range of moods completely and assuredly within their grasp. They certainly push each other, but they never overreach (one particularly dissonant passage in the aptly-titled “Snow Storm Coming” could be a mess in shakier hands, but here it feels like humans controlling weather). The thrill of Cactus is not that the music could fall apart at any moment, but that this duo can handle anything they throw at each other.\"],[22300,\"“Ladies and gentleman, this woman standing next to me is an electronic wizard,” declared a bemused and gleeful David Letterman on his show in 1980. He sounded like a wide-eyed child standing beside a chipper alien, one with braids in her hair, giving network-television watchers a portal into her new expanding universe. Letterman listed off her credentials: composing commercial soundtracks for the likes of Coca-Cola, reproducing electronic effects for “the disco version of Star Wars,” and winning many awards. “This is Suzanne Ciani,” Letterman goes, as she slathered the befuddled host’s voice in quizzical delay. Laughter persisted. “Tell ‘em what we got here,” Letterman asked, and Ciani pointed out her Prophet-5 synthesizer, a vocoder, a frequency follower, an Eventide harmonizer—“That means nothing to anybody but you!” the host interjects. “Do the one where it sounds like the whole studio’s gonna explode!” Ciani offered a pitched-shifted affirmation: “Don't be afraiiid...”In 1980, the pioneering Ciani—who would go on to earn several Grammy nominations in the New Age category—was a decade into her experiments with the modular Buchla synthesizers, which she used to create dramatic seconds-long effects for the likes of the Xenon pinball game, PBS, and Atari. And Ciani had also just begun work on her own debut masterpiece, the elegantly spare Seven Waves, released in Japan in 1982 and the U.S. two years later. “In order to see something, you have to have a concept of it,” Ciani, now 70, told The Quietus in 2012. “People had no concept of electronic music back then. So even if they were sitting in front of a machine and sound was coming out of it, they still didn’t get it.” Even as electricity has become the preeminent building-block of our musical lexicon, the Buchla—with its wires spilling over a landscape of knobs, its tactile sense of exploration, of conversing subtly with the machine—is still extremely rare. But fate has its way of bringing outsiders together. That Ciani would encounter a fellow Buchla synthesist, the 30-year-old Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, while sitting on the floor at a dinner party in the isolated California coastal town of Bolinas, where they both happen to live, is fantastic serendipity.Ciani herself had abandoned the Buchla for decades, making her name as a classical pianist. It wasn’t until a 2012 reissue of her work, Lixiviation, by the Finders Keepers label, that she became “reincarnated as a Buchla person,” and a reissue of her groundbreaking 1975 Buchla concerts followed. Before a European tour spurred on by Lixiviation, Ciani hired Smith as a studio assistant. New York’s RVNG label ultimately asked them to collaborate for the 13th installment of its FRKWYS series, which brings together musicians of different generations in an improvisatory setting, always with the care of a gallery piece. In a film produced by RVNG during the making of the album—at Ciani’s home near a cliff with exquisite views of the Pacific—the elder artist is seen with her Buchla 200 E, a wooden box propped open with wires all flowing about, a full display of the machine and its sound’s infinity. Smith uses the slightly more contained Buchla Music Easel, which appears like a mysterious pad.The resulting Sunergy is 54 minutes of generative music in three pieces, “A New Day,” “Closed Circuit,” and the bonus track “Retrograde” (absent from the vinyl pressing). Their energy exchange is potent. Sunergy is far from the lovely analog melodies and white noise that Ciani released on Seven Waves—it more so shares the thick, dewy feel of Smith’s 2016 EARS—but as they cross-pollinate, those titular crests are all over. Sunergy is made of crashing waves and the glittering sun on water, meditations from the Terry Riley school of minimalism, as if Laurie Spiegel had composed for the tides rather than the cosmos. Ciani said she had a “long-standing desire to orchestrate the sunrise... [and] there was this synergy between us, and also the energy of the sun and the energy of the ocean... I think that’s where Sunergy came from.”“A New Day” opens with an ominous, tectonic rumble that engulfs you like a circling Tibetan singing bowl. Sounds cut in from all angles, with static juxtaposing sparkling bleeps and textures that pop like candy. There are sounds of epic winds and rippling water, and its hypnosis seems to say something about journeying through time, about nature mixing with the artificial, about the promise and threat of the future. “Closed Circuit” comprises simpler synth figures, before swimming far out into a dark sea, a picture of the unknown. “Retrograde” takes on harsher, denser noise, but its menacing scrape is tempered with light.All along, Sunergy makes for an inquisitive space to inhabit. The headier and grander it grows, the more its heavy drones swarm, the more undeniable the duo’s alchemy proves to be. “I was in love with it,” Ciani once said of her introduction to the Buchla, “It took my whole life… It was my boyfriend! I thought there was something wrong with me, because I was in love with a machine.” But her devotion was prescient. It is moving to hear Ciani and Smith—in some sense, creative soulmates—commune so deeply. Because people like Ciani don’t come down to Earth to join the world. They recruit comrades to enter their own.\"],[22335,\"Michael Christmas and Prefuse 73 are both fringe rap in different senses. The Boston rapper Christmas took an unconventional path to niche web stardom bottling Superbad awkwardness on “Michael Cera,” which prefaced a breakout mixtape cheekily titled Is This Art?. As Prefuse 73, Guillermo Scott Herren has spent much of the last 15 years making IDM out of rap fragments, living at the edge of both genres. (Herren once had a day job making what he’s called “prehistoric trap beats,” which he hated.) His best rap artifact remains his Warp debut, Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, a constantly breaking record that took swatches of sound from songs by Nas and ODB and let them glitch, like trying to tune an FM radio to a late ’90s rap station during a hurricane. Christmas and Prefuse aren’t a match most would peg as a dream collaboration. Prefuse’s fractured style is more fit for off-beat swaggering of MF DOOM or the cranny-filling wordplay of Aesop Rock, both of whom were guests on Vocal Studies. And Christmas’ relatable stand-up act is better suited for warmer productions. He didn’t even know who Prefuse 73 was before they were put in a room together. But Prefuse’s more traditional flirtations with rap suggested that the pairing could not only work but even be engaging. At the behest of Christmas’ label, Lex Records, the two joined forces as Fudge for Lady Parts, a collaborative record that attempts to find common ground and marry their sounds somewhere at their outer limits. But despite a valiant effort from both, it’s a record that sounds better in theory than in practice.Lady Parts isn’t an ideal entry point for either, nor is it their best work; they contort themselves into odd shapes trying to fit each other’s tendencies. There’s always a feeling-out process with collaborations like this one, but this never actually finds the sweet spot. Sonically, it is a variety pack from Herren, a sampler that scans much of his discography seeking out good fits for Christmas. The cuts all burst, and many are even mildly thrilling, but nothing here is nearly as off-kilter or kinetic as anything from his last release, Rivington Nao Rio. Conversely, Christmas occasionally steps outside himself trying to do too much in response, especially on songs like “These Saturdays” and “Japanese Mall,” which take him way out of his comfort zone, asking him to create chemistry where there isn’t any. Christmas is best at commanding center stage, using his wit, presence, and comedic eye to control a setting and win over an audience, but Prefuse’s work is designed to stand alone, to create and sustain its own energy by constantly moving and adjusting. Both can’t happen here. This unintentional tug of war mires even their greatest experiments, which at their peak are both fun and frenetic. Sometimes Christmas gets lost in waves of sound (“Showstopper,” “I Got the Good”) or thrown off by a quick beat shift. He likes to build to his strongest punchlines; Prefuse, on the other hand, likes to jump-cut swiftly through ideas. Their styles just aren’t quite compatible.But that doesn’t mean they come up empty on Lady Parts. Even without great chemistry, they make a handful of entertaining songs that thrive on sheer amusement. On “Young Vet,” Christmas ad-libs train sounds and car skids over a backflipping vocal loop, rapping about Scooby Doo and slut-shaming in the same breath. With five songs clocking in at under two minutes, Lady Parts often benefits from brevity. The punches come in flurries, and on “Crash” and “Circuit Breaker,” Christmas does some of his jolliest rapping. “Circuit Breaker” is where everything clicks, with Herren looping up a steady pulse that Christmas finally settles into.Herren is an exceptional talent who is perhaps just better suited to solo work, but these sounds still carry his signature traits as Prefuse 73, zigzagging, rupturing, and splintering in weird places. Christmas is a fun-loving rapper with an infectious personality, filling the productions with references to Nerf guns, Grand Theft Auto strip clubs, and Twix commercials. He has bars like “Girls used to think my dad was Ma$e\\/Money make me do the Harlem Shake” and “Girls smell amazing like a Glade Plugin.” He doesn’t take himself too seriously and it’s a strength. In fact, Lady Parts as a whole is made in his image, and that may be its redeeming quality in the end. Despite its faults and flaws, it mostly scans as two talented musicians just having a good time.\"],[22379,\"Given the abundance of heavy music that addresses theatrical horror, it’s a shame how only a tiny fraction of it confronts the real-life horror that lurks under our noses. With Light Falls, Wrekmeister Harmonies help offset this imbalance for the third album in a row, as bandleader J.R. Robinson continues to hone-in on the mundane roots of evil. Along with likeminded acts such as SubRosa, Wrekmeister Harmonies weave chamber elements into metal-based forms. Like their previous album Night of Your Ascension, Light Falls presents new angles on the doom sub-genre. But where Ascension’s long stretches of choral chanting and plodding, monolithic doom sections gave the music an impenetrable facade, here Robinson finally achieves the seamless integration he’s been pursuing since launching the project in 2006. A large part of Robinson’s success comes from a less heavy-handed approach. Yes, Godspeed You! Black Emperor drummer Timothy Herzog plays big and bombastic, sometimes openly emulating Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham’s signature kick-drum pedal work. But Herzog swings more than Robinson’s previous guest drummers, and the drums on Light Falls occupy a more discreet position in the mix. Robinson also carves out more space for the arrangements, giving even the heaviest of the new material a vintage texture unlike the wall of distortion that characterized Ascension. Core member Esther Shaw is joined by Sophie Trudeau (also of Godspeed) who both use the increased space as an opportunity to steal the show.With both playing piano and violin, Shaw and Trudeau shine on the album’s gentler tunes, “Light Falls I: The Mantra,” “Where Have You Been My Lovely Son,” and “My Lovely Son Reprise.” Most remarkably, though, their violin work also mesmerizes on the crashing “Some Were Saved Some Drowned,” an invigorating example of how Wrekmeister Harmonies are locating flexibility within the rigid patterns of doom metal. Shaw and Trudeau don’t merely hold their own but threaten to engulf the guitars the whole way. Not only does the song highlight the significant progression between the last album and this one, but it also brings into communion all of the musical and thematic qualities that set Wrekmeister Harmonies apart.Wrekmeister Harmonies’ body of work makes it clear that, as an artist, Robinson is driven to reconcile with our most disturbing impulses. At the same time, his music attempts to illuminate the humanity at the heart of our darkness. “Some Were Saved Some Were Drowned” derives its title from Holocaust survivor Primo Levi’s book, The Drowned and the Saved, which according to fellow author and essayist Tim Parks “must rank as one of the most powerful and upsetting attempts at moral analysis ever undertaken.” As Parks points out, Levi’s writing hardly spares the concentration camp prisoners it documents. In fact, one of its biggest takeaways is that the victims at Auschwitz could succumb to as much cruelty as their torturers.Taken together, Night of Ascension and Light Falls work as a triptych portrayal of human depravity. Ascension first deals with one individual's act of double murder, then escalates in scope to address the Catholic Church’s institutional complicity in its molestation scandal. On Light Falls, Robinson ups the ante yet again by turning his gaze on the Holocaust. Because Robinson tends not to overplay his lyrical hand (Wrekmeister Harmonies albums contain only a sprinkling of vocals), it’s not like you can listen to Light Falls and walk away with a better understanding of what drives human beings to commit unimaginable acts of violence.But understanding isn’t the point here. The mysteries that Robinson can’t seem to turn away from might elude our understanding forever. With Light Falls, though, he makes a most convincing case to go toward them rather than try and evade or ignore them. He also turns that case into an immensely rewarding listen that takes both his band—and the hybrid genre he’s helping invent—to new heights.\"],[22360,\"On last year’s DRINKS, Tim Presley and Cate Le Bon threw out the rock rulebook and forged their own scrappy tools of invention. Wielding their guitars like crudely hewn spades, the newly formed duo tilled indiscriminately through history, splicing krautrock with hippie folk and welding inside jokes to piercing proto-synths. Partially inspired by Soul Jazz’s Punk 45: There Is No Such Thing As Society Vol 2 compilation, the agitated vibe mussed Le Bon’s usual tidy surfaces on this year’s Crab Day, and returns to scare every trace of classic rock out of Tim Presley’s solo debut, The Wink, which Le Bon produces.Over the course of their six albums to date, Presley’s shaggy classicists White Fence have marched ever closer to something resembling clarity. The Wink is also a clean listen, but significantly starker than White Fence fans might expect, trading jet-thrusting psychedelia for the rickety twang common to “Bike”-era Pink Floyd, post-punk anarchists, and the Fiery Furnaces at their most ornery. Throughout, Presley seems like the willing supplicant to Le Bon’s autodidact.Although it starts with an interlude that suggests seals welcoming you to a séance, The Wink is a more coherent and approachable record than DRINKS. As Presley’s songwriting comes back into focus after that wigged-out record, he seems both damaged and reinvigorated, his atonal guitar and nervy register often exuding an appealing, hen-pecked panic. On these harder moments, Le Bon chucks in curveballs to up the ante, like the dabbles of vaudeville piano on the title track, Warpaint drummer Stella Mozgawa’s trolley-crash emphases on “Solitude Cola,” and the slack saxophone on “ER” that billows like a deflated Airdancer. The disparate elements combine to something resembling a riff from Presley’s track “Clue,” albeit one that also evokes Television attacking an obstacle course.Presley’s abstract impressionism is surprising and rich with detail, though there are gentler life rafts here as respite from the madness. “I can’t wait to write to you, love of my life!” he swoons on the amiable “Goldfish Wheelchair” (where the Californian sounds suspiciously Welsh). “All done!” he declares, as if he’s just plopped his note in the letterbox. Presley’s lyrics are mostly inscrutable streams of consciousness that are meaningful to him alone, but the occasional plainspoken tenderness leaps out like a shooting star: “And I’ve whittled my sticks\\/And my love cannot miss,” he chants on “Long Bow,” “It’s a long bow\\/Pull tight.”The Wink is a high-wire act that may find more fans among, say, free jazz listeners than conventional rock lovers. But even if the scratchy destination lacks home comforts, the journey is its own thrill. In DRINKS, Le Bon and Presley tore up the rules; on The Wink, they set about rewriting them to their own addictive whims.\"],[22336,\"People die in Nick Cave songs. They get wiped out in floods, zapped in electric chairs, and mowed down en masse in saloon shoot-outs. For Cave, death serves as both a dramatic and rhetorical device—it’s great theater, but it’s also swift justice for those who have done wrong, be it in the eyes of a lover or the Lord. As I once heard him quip in concert: “This next one’s a morality tale… they’re all morality tales, really. It’s what I do.”But despite amassing a songbook that needs its own morgue, on their 16th album together, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds must contend with something that is not so easily depicted: the sound of mourning. In July 2015, Cave’s 15-year-old son Arthur—one of his twin sons with wife Susie Bick—died when he accidentally fell from a cliff near the family’s current home in Brighton, England. The writing and recording of Skeleton Tree had commenced before the tragic incident, but the album was completed in its aftermath, and its specter hangs over it like a black fog.This is a record that exists in the headspace and guts of someone who’s endured an unspeakable, inconsolable trauma. And though the songs are not explicitly about Arthur they are uncannily about coming to terms with loss and the realization that things will never be the same again. As if to reinforce Skeleton Tree’s therapeutic quality, the notoriously taciturn Cave opened the studio door to director Andrew Dominik, who documented the album’s completion—in 3D, no less—for the companion film One More Time With Feeling. It’s almost as if by thrusting himself into the spotlight during his darkest hour, Cave was issuing a form of karmic payback, penance for the pain and reckoning he’s inflicted on so many characters in his songs.If you try to listen to Skeleton Tree removed from its somber context, the album feels very much like a natural step from 2013’s Push the Sky Away, whose premium on disquieting, ambient textures and wandering-mind lyricism now seems like less like a momentary detour than the gateway into an intriguing new phase for the Bad Seeds. But where that record rallied for show-stopping epics like “Jubilee Street” and “Higgs Boson Blues,” Skeleton Tree’s drones and jitters offer no such moments of release. The skies, seas, and mermaids that previously dominated Cave’s thoughts are still very much present here. But on the opening “Jesus Alone,” he’s wading deeper into the chop, the safety of the shoreline fading further out of view as he gets swept up by pattering drum drifts, humming organs, and swelling orchestration. The song was among the first Cave wrote for the record, yet its opening image—“You fell from the sky, crash-landed in a field near the River Adur”—feels unbearably prescient. It isn’t so much about the finality of death as the ambiguity of the afterlife: Cave’s orator welcomes a litany of souls into purgatory, but his stern proclamation—“With my voice, I am calling you”—makes it unclear whether they’ll be redeemed in heaven or damned to hell.This great unknowing serves as the album’s guiding principle. In Cave’s wounded voice, you hear him grapple in real-time with the incidental prophecies of his lyrics and his need to get the job done. In one of the album’s most harrowing moments, he closes the bleak, grief-stricken ballad “Girl in Amber” by repeating the words, “Don’t touch me,” as if a consoling hug would only exacerbate the pain. Not every song is infused with such omens, but their restlessness is emblematic of the album’s fraught recording process. By Bad Seeds’ standards, “Rings of Saturn” is practically a chillwave song, its dusty drum loop smothered in a soft-focus synth gauze. But Cave’s numbed, sing-speak delivery is laid bare above the smooth texture—not even a cooing chorus of millennial whoops can rouse him. And as surprising as it is to hear a dogged non-conformist like Cave embrace some au courant pop device, here it functions as a faded reminder of a more carefree time—like how, in our most helpless moments, a sentimental song can turn you into a mess.“Rings of Saturn” is one of several tracks on Skeleton Tree where Cave sings about or through an enigmatic female character. Like one of those “Sopranos” episodes where Tony is trapped in his dreams, nothing makes sense on the surface, but every hallucinatory image and mysterious gesture is loaded with circuitous significance. The “woman in a yellow dress surrounded by a charm of hummingbirds” awaiting her call to the pearly gates in “Jesus Alone” could very well be the one at the center of “Magneto,” whose quivering atmospherics and panting delivery suggest a goth Astral Weeks. “It was the year I officially became the bride of Jesus,” Cave intones, before blithely revealing, “The urge to kill somebody was basically overwhelming\\/I had such hard blues down there in the supermarket queues.” But that prosaic setting is revisited from a different vantage in the parched-throat synth-pop serenade “I Need You,” where the crestfallen narrator sings, “I saw you standing there in the supermarket with your red dress, falling, and your eyes are to the ground,” as if observing a woman he once loved but no longer recognizes in her current distressed state.And yet even the relentless ache of “I Need You”—the closest Cave has come to actually crying on record—hardly prepares you for a pair of closing tracks that will reduce the most hardened hearts to puddles. “Distant Sky” may initially come on like a simple invitation to escape (“Let us go now, my one true love\\/Call the gasman, cut the power off!”), but once the divine Danish vocalist Else Torp emerges, the song elevates to a form of secular last rites. Musically, “Distant Sky” is all soothing organ tones and celestial orchestration, but the song’s weightlessness is utterly crushing, as Cave crystallizes the mood of Skeleton Tree in one trembling, devastating line: “They told us our gods would outlive us\\/But they lied.”By contrast, the lilting gospel sway of the final title track feels more earthbound. It’s an attempt to step out of the void and reconnect with the waking world while recognizing that grieving doesn’t happen on a standard timeline—you don’t just hole yourself up for three months of weeping and then emerge fully recovered. Grief is a wraith of love that haunts your soul, emerging when you least expect it from the most mundane triggers and surroundings. “I call out, right across the sea,” Cave sings, “but the echo comes back empty.” However, the darkness has at least acquired enough definition for Cave to make out a path forward. The last line Cave sings on the album is “It’s all right now,” less a declaration of closure than an acceptance it may never come. \"],[22283,\"Some classic albums have origin stories that threaten to eclipse the music itself. My Bloody Valentine almost bankrupted Creation over Loveless. Bruce Springsteen’s Nebraska was just a cassette demo that he carried around in his pocket before deciding to release it. Brian Wilson’s inability to finish SMiLE caused him a mental breakdown. Add to these E2-E4, the marvelous extended electronic work by Manuel Göttsching, former leader of the key krautrock band Ash Ra Tempel.After the dissolution of Ash Ra Tempel in the mid-’70s, Göttsching began working solo as Ashra, moving away from his earlier band’s wooly psychedelic rock and toward structures based on ambiance and his interest in Terry Riley-style minimalism. Both the trance-inducing repetition of 1975’s Inventions for Electric Guitar and the softer drones of 1976’s New Age of Earth showed his mastery of these forms, and he would build on them. In December 1981, having just returned from a tour with his friend Klaus Schulze, Göttsching was alone in his home studio and decided to create an improvised piece as an exercise, and also to give himself a tape to listen to on an upcoming trip. Moving between his battery of synthesizers and sequencing devices, he settled on a gentle two-chord vamp on his Prophet 10, to which he added an array of pinging electronic percussion and simple melodic figures. And over the second half of the piece, he laid down an extended guitar solo. Cut live without overdubs in a single hour, E2-E4 became, upon its eventual release in 1984, an electronic music landmark.E2-E4 has an elusive appeal, one that is mysterious even to its maker. In 1981 and ’82, Göttsching was partway through planning a new solo album—it was quite complicated, with different sections and laborious themes. He wasn’t sure what to do with this new music, which came so easily. By 1981, Göttsching had made many pieces at home on his own for many purposes, but this one was lightning in a bottle. Like the longjumper Bob Beamon—whose one perfect jump at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics set a world record that he never came close to reaching before or since—Göttsching puzzled over his flawless moment. He listened to his creation over and over, trying to figure out why it worked so well, looking for some reason it wasn’t as good as it seemed. But he was at a loss. There were no mistakes, no incomplete ideas. It wasn’t too loud or too soft or too derivative. For one magic hour, the perfectly realized music floats in space, inviting listeners to admire it from the outside and then dance within it.There are two things to hear in E2-E4: what the music is, and what the ideas within it would become. It’s sublime as a present-moment listening experience, with beautiful textures and a glorious symmetry. E2-E4 is like one long pop song stretched over 60 minutes, which is to say it’s sort of like its own DJ set. It plays with pop structures, but on a much larger canvas—a change that might last for a few bars in a pop single might last, here, for four minutes. At the 23-minute mark, there’s a several-minutes-long section where Göttsching starts flanging the tones and it feels something like dub; it’s kind of like a bridge. At the 3:35 mark, a pinging melody first enters, and that feels like a verse. As with many pop songs, there is an instrumental break, and in this case, it’s a guitar solo that lasts for a full album side. Göttsching vibrates with his riff in harmony, winding out fluid lines in the middle register that function as a rhythmic counterpoint and shifting melody simultaneously.If three chords form the skeleton of punk, then two chords are the soul of techno, the minimum the music can move and still be changing. Göttsching’s guitar solo is reminiscent of Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour, with its clean but expressive tone that mixes a touch of jazz and blues with a more free-floating pointillist psychedelia. And Göttsching’s guitar work highlights one of E2-E4’s most appealing qualities: that the music sits precisely at the point where the human meets the machine. The great bulk of the music is synthesized and sequenced, a Rube Goldberg-like device that winds through pre-programmed sections, but when his guitar enters, we hear the touch of a musician brought up playing classical music on nylon strings. The human hand and the circuits also switch roles, though. If the warm tone of the machines can feel almost human, like an invitation—a friendly and welcoming sound perfect for the communion of the dancefloor—Göttsching’s tightly controlled guitar work sometimes has a mechanical quality, existing in clear relation to the sequencer’s grid.So that’s the music as it plays. But for those interested in the larger sweep of history, it’s impossible not to listen and hear how ahead of its time this record was. Simply put, E2-E4 sounds a great deal like techno would when it emerged roughly a decade later, and it came from someone with no interest in dance music. As he was contemplating releasing E2-E4, Göttsching visited Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Records, his then-current label, on Branson’s houseboat in order to play him the tape. In a beautifully told story from the liner notes of this reissue, Göttsching says that Branson was rocking his baby in his arms as the tape played, an apt image given the gentle undulations of the chords. “Manuel, you could make a fortune with this music,” Göttsching quotes Branson as saying, and indeed, a fortune would be made from the ideas found on E2-E4. But Göttsching wouldn’t be the one to collect it. Göttsching eventually issued E2-E4 in 1984 on Klaus Schulze’s label, and it didn’t sell well, moving only a few thousand copies. But a handful of those wound up in the right hands.E2-E4 is also the story of formats. When Göttsching first contemplated releasing it, he realized that its 58-minute length presented difficulties. It was conceived as a single flowing piece, but an hour was generally considered too long even for a single LP, if one wants it to sound good. A skilled disc cutter was able to get a 30+ minute side down in 1984, and thanks to the record’s popularity in clubs, it still feels like a vinyl artifact. Which is one reason this exceptionally well-done reissue is so welcome. Great care was taken in getting the cut right. The 31-minute side, though at a relatively low volume, is clean and clear, even in the inner grooves. One could argue that a seamless digital version of the piece is the “real” version, but if vinyl was good enough for Larry Levan—who, unbeknownst to Göttsching, made the record a regular part of his sets for a time at the Paradise Garage—it’s good enough for me.The music’s reputation in dance music circles reached a peak when three Italo producers approached him about re-working the tune for a dance music 12” in 1989. That record, released under the name “Sueño Latino,” turned out to be an international hit, and a 1992 remix from Detroit producer Derrick May brought the music full circle. Which gets back to one of E2-E4’s essential qualities: cut in a single hour, it wound its way across the world, morphing and changing with formats and remixes, finding new contexts, a music that is constantly in the process of becoming.\"],[22303,\"If the grid is what gives techno its shape and its structure, then resisting the grid—warping its contours, cheating its grip, slipping through hidden cracks—is what gives techno its life. Syncopation, flux, slippage: These are all strategies for escaping the rigidity of the too-perfect beat, and all of these escape hatches have long been at the center of Cristian Vogel’s work. The Chilean-born, UK-raised producer has spent his entire career teasing out a fundamental contradiction: Repetition is both techno’s defining feature and its Achilles’ heel.Vogel got his start in Brighton’s anarchic techno scene alongside artists like Si Begg and Subhead and in the mid-’90s on Berlin’s Tresor label, he began brokering a series of unstable truces between order and chaos. Compared to most techno, Vogel’s sounds have always been especially untamed. On landmark albums like All Music Has Come to an End and Dungeon Master, he favored squeals and squelches, a metallic scrape and glassy clank, all lending to an impression of greased ball bearings tossed on a dusty floor. It was techno that was designed to trip you up.For the past decade, Vogel has focused his efforts on making music with Kyma, a complex software application and programming language geared toward generative processes and the real-time control of advanced sound design. Autechre are among Kyma’s best-known adopters, but its use extends far beyond experimental dance music; the WALL-E sound designer Ben Burtt used it to fashion the voices of the film’s robots, “performing” their pixelated pitch-shifting using a light pen and a tablet. In Vogel’s hands, the tools help him achieve a kind of rhythmic, loop-based music that is constantly morphing.The Assistenz builds upon the sounds and ideas that run through 2012’s The Inertials and 2014’s Polyphonic Beings, juggling dub-techno, industrial crunch, and the queasy tones of academic computer music. A fine, grey dust seems to cover everything, and every beat kicks up tiny squalls of soot. He concentrates mostly on the tempo range between 130 and 150 beats per minute, forgoing four-to-the-floor rhythms in favor of lurching, uneven cadences. “Vessels” hurtles along like a ghost train just barely clinging to the rails, and though the force of the drums is unmistakably violent, it feels muted by the reverb that hangs over it. “Telemorphosis” has a similarly contradictory feel, with zapping electrical frequencies smothered by thick, noxious fumes. Part of his project entails breaking down the division between texture and rhythm: The deeper you listen, the more microscopic textural elements blossom into finely detailed patterns. To peer into the penumbra of these tracks is like getting lost in the inky tangle of an Albrecht Dürer woodcut. But Vogel isn’t above bashing out a spectacularly forceful groove, either. The shuddering electro of “Cubic Haze” is built around a gut-punching 808 whose every hit seems, like the bullets in The Matrix, to displace the air around it in tight, concentric rings.The album is a pretty bleak affair. After all, it gets its name from a graveyard in Copenhagen, the city where Vogel recorded it. And if the album has a flaw, it’s that the mood is a little too uniform. Even given Vogel’s habit of changing up the flow mid-track only to drop out the beat and simply let everything breathe for a bit, the first four tracks pile up like a slow-motion car crash. Fortunately, the album’s back half is more varied. Immediately following “Cubic Haze,” the record’s rhythmic highlight, “Signal Symbol” offers a gorgeous stretch of luminous, beatless drones reminiscent of Wolfgang Voigt’s Gas material; at five-and-a-half minutes, it could easily go four times as long. Vogel brings his rhythmic interests and his ambient skills together on “Barefoot Agnete,” The Assistenz’s centerpiece and indisputable highlight. Throughout the album, faint murmurs can occasionally be picked out of the murk, but the haunting “Barefoot Agnete” is the only track to put the voice front and center. As a skeletal drum pattern beats out a ritualistic rhythm, a woman’s wordless voice is digitally liquefied until it burbles like a mountain spring. For eight minutes, nothing changes except the small contours of that voice as it trickles into the darkness, and it is absolutely spellbinding.\"],[22306,\"KoKoro, the latest album by El Perro Del Mar, takes its title from the Japanese word meaning heart or feeling, and from there you get a hint of what’s to come on: new musical terrain informed by an exotic “Far East” sensibility, couched in familiar El Perro Del Mar territory of melancholy and vulnerability. Almost 12 years into her career as El Perro Del Mar, founder Sarah Assbring’s appetite for reinvention remains strong. On KoKoro, the Swedish singer’s fifth album, her global wanderings bring her to unfamiliar places with inspiring albeit uneven results that showcase an artist who could easily make a turn for pop stardom.Assbring has said that she’d been listening heavily to Japanese, Chinese, and Cambodian ’60s pop prior to the making of the album, but the influences of these sources on KoKoro are so overt and jumbled with modern pop and world music sensibilities, it comes off as a hodgepodge of cultural tourism. Throughout the album, Assbring utilizes classical Asian and Middle Eastern instruments such as the Chinese stringed guzheng, the Japanese shakuhachi, and various other flutes and strings—all played by a cast of Swedish musicians—and features rhythms and melodies casually identifiable with all of the above backgrounds along with Ethiopia, Egypt, and Indonesia.Coordinated or not, Assbring does a remarkably good job taking all of these sounds and fusing them into vibrant, bouncy pop songs that are miles away from the ’60s-inspired tunes of her early career. It wasn’t until 2012’s Pale Fire that Assbring first attempted to seriously change up the El Perro Del Mar sound, but while it was evident that her voice and talents could translate to more radio-friendly dance-pop, the album frequently played like feathery nostalgia for late ’90s lounge house and trip-hop. On KoKoro, however, Assbring seems to have figured out the transition, and its strongest cuts are her best arguments yet for shifting the El Perro Del Mar paradigm.“Kouign-Amman” (a type of French pastry) blends Assbring’s pan-Asian fetish with spunky futurist pop. Exploding from the speakers with a sunny and reverbed vocals, Assbring weaves in a guzheng string melody in a way that feels organic and enmeshed rather than simply appended. Title track “KoKoro” comes the closest to true 21st-century world music, with a huge, echoing “kinda Middle Eastern” chiftetelli beat and bleating flutes. Assbring’s voice is also loud and present, living in the fabric of the song in a way that it never did on Pale Fire. It’s music for smiling under the late afternoon sun on a party boat on the Bosphorus with a crew of happy hedonists.Best of all, if not quite as archly pop as the others, is the stunning baroque opener “Endless Ways.” Featuring delicately embedded strings and backing vocals that moan and tug, “Endless Ways” is a perfect synthesis of all of El Perro Del Mar’s developments as an artist. Lyrically it also represents an important touchpoint for Assbring’s transformation, outlining her sense of self-reflection in figuring out how to become a better artist: “I think I was too softly defined\\/I wish I was all pure\\/The goal I have is carved in my mind\\/Perfection is hard.” It sure is, but as pop songs go, “Endless Ways” certainly gets close.Because of Assbring’s attempts at drawing from these ethnocultural traditions without a sense of clear rhyme or reason, its weaker compositions sound more “White Euro-Woman Does ‘The Far East’” rather than the breezily blended post-globalization culture mashes of M.I.A. Tracks like “Ging Ging” and lead singles “Breadandbutter” and “Ding Sum” don’t just feature the aforementioned guzheng for flair but spotlight it as a conspicuous driver of sound to a degree that feels fetishized rather than borrowed. KoKoro isn’t perfect, but Assbring’s knack for creating well-written, catchy melodies carries the record it even in its slightest moments and a huge step forward from Pale Fire, positioning El Perro Del Mar well for an interesting Act II as a modern world pop purveyor. \"],[22396,\"When revisiting the culture that informed her 2005 debut album Arular, Maya Arulpragasam painted the 2000s with a rose-colored tint. “We had way better fucking music. People were having way better sex. People were eating way better food. It’s like we had progression,” she told Rolling Stone last year. She concluded that in 2015, broadly speaking, art was boring and safe, due to the lack of “fireworks,” the repetition, and the disappearance of the “new.” It was a recalcitrant comment, sure, but also unsurprising coming from M.I.A. What felt unnatural was all this nostalgia. M.I.A. has always been an artist interested in constant reinvention—the past, it seemed to her, was nothing compared to the future. Her music, her art, her years of public confrontation were once prophetic.But today it’s increasingly clear that many pieces of her creative legacy, from the caustic inhuman sheen of Maya to the bullet casings that litter “Paper Planes,” have either been plundered or misinterpreted. The fake patois of Drake’s “One Dance” blaring from car windows all around the world, the ubiquity of greasy synths and rattling gun-shot samples in dance music (see any of the artists in NON or Fade to Mind), and the globalization of American and European pop music all can trace a thread back to M.I.A.’s experiments, both failed and successful. Her evaluation of art in the present was another middle finger pointed at watchful eyes, and now, with the release of her fifth album, AIM, it’s become an unintended self-criticism of her own inability to light the fuse.The lead-up to AIM was not without expected provocation. Before the album had a name there was a music video. It was searing and combative, an addictive piece of agitprop that once again aligned M.I.A. as one of our best political artists. The video for “Borders” depicted a dramatization of border crossing that was at once complicated, blunt, and grandly rendered. The song was empathetic about the global refugee crisis, (“We’re solid and we don’t need to kick them\\/This is North, South, East and Western”) yet it was also a polemic against media saturation and the endless panoply of issues both serious and inane (borders, politics, identities, privilege, being bae, breaking the internet) that made any action impossible. When she summons these topics through the course of the song, she cooly punctures them with a simple question, “What’s up with that?” Overall, it was the type of sobering political gesture that was much needed in the music discourse. Then the controversies started.She was dropped as the headliner for London’s upcoming Afropunk Festival after clumsily targeting Black Lives Matter and the activist inclinations of musicians like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé, asking if questions like “Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?\\\\\" would function into the dominant conversation in pop music. Then she got mad about MTV overlooking “Borders” for this year’s VMAs, accusing the media corporation of “racism, classism, sexism, elitism” and essentially policing what kind of voices were institutionally sanctioned. And naturally, she threatened to leak AIM (which she also threatened to do with her last album), and claimed that Interscope refused to clear samples for a Diplo-produced version of “Bird Song.” After the predictably rocky months of rollout, the 17 songs of AIM read as a disappointment, lacking bite and bounce, and presenting only glimmers of what once was. For what went wrong, look no further than what might’ve been the big pop hit of the album, “Freedun,” a collaboration with smoldering One Direction malcontent Zayn Malik. The song was apparently written over Whatsapp, and it certainly contains all the half-baked charm of a group text thread. “I’m a swagger man\\/Rolling in my swagger van\\/From the People’s Republic Of Swaggerstan,” she begins, extremely inauspiciously. It’s the forgivable brick from someone with a history of lyrics that are at the very least provocative or allusive. But this specific brand of poor writing haunts the album. In “Bird Song,” her avian puns are grating: “I believe like R. Kelly, we can fly\\/But toucan fly together\\/Staying rich like an ostrich.” Her voice seems flatter, inelastic, and without her early inventiveness. At the same time, AIM isn’t saved by some world-beating or state-of-the-art production. Neither M.I.A. nor or her collaborators (including Skrillex and longtime producer Blaqstarr) come close to the vibrancy of her previous work. Take “Foreign Friend,” with its half-hearted drum beat, sleepy progression, and clunky construction. Its pallid form turns the song’s sharp narrative about cultural assimilation into a trying slog. This has never been a problem with her music before—even when it didn't work, it was wild and freewheeling, intelligently and deftly compacting rhythms from around the world under a single flag. But these songs are diffuse, thin on hooks, and often recycle through old warhorses of polyrhythmic percussion and splattered sampling. It’s telling that “Visa” samples her debut single “Galang” in its back half. It creates a bizarre effect, like listening to M.I.A. do karaoke over her own music. “Visa” also heavily references—almost eulogizes—her past work (“They call me Arular, trendsetter, making life feel better\\/Breaking order like a leader now follow”). It’s as if she is well aware of how newness has escaped her, as much she feels it has escaped the world at large. This recursive comment would work better if the album were explicitly framed as a referendum on her career up to this point: the boredom and frustration of the present as an endless reflection of the past. Instead, whatever grand vision AIM is hoping for becomes muddled. While the highlights offer glimmers of hope, like “Ali R U OK”—an incisive narrative about capitalism’s degradation of immigrant hustle—AIM is in desperate need of a clear identity or throughline. Diplo once said, “Albums now are a hit song and 11 other songs that are attached to it.” “Borders” will live on as one of many crown jewels in some future retrospective of M.I.A.’s music, but AIM is otherwise her dullest album. For all the accusations that she’s been blithe, unaware, or plain reckless with her messaging, there has never been a more crucial time for pop music that wrestles with globalization, transnational suffering, and the plight of immigrants. While she may never have been the most articulate and thoughtful messenger, in AIM, M.I.A. demonstrates her legacy as an artist eager to tackle issues that are volatile and antagonistic. But at this point her music is more potent in theory than execution. \"],[22343,\"Neil Young boasted of steering his career into “the ditch” in the early 1970s, choosing to make sad, lonely, difficult records in the wake of Harvest’s wide success. The “Ditch Trilogy” (as Young enthusiasts dubbed it) of Time Fades Away, Tonight’s the Night, and On the Beach marks his creative peak—yet for decades, this era was neglected and incomplete. On the Beach only made it to CD in 2003, and Time Fades Away was never reissued digitally.Thanks to the vinyl revival, the trio is finally available. Rereleased initially as a pricey Record Store Day box set, and now as individual LPs, the “Ditch Trilogy” records—plus its sunnier epilogue, Zuma—are back in print for the first time since their original releases. So while On the Beach and Tonight’s the Night are well-established masterpieces, now’s the time to consider the on-ramp and the off-ramp to the Ditch, and understand how Young entered that dark spiral and how he escaped it.Time Fades Away is the album Neil Young didn’t want us to hear; in several interviews over the years, he’s bluntly referred to it as his “worst album.” In Waging Heavy Peace, Young’s 2012 memoir, the 1973 live album is mentioned exactly twice, which is approximately 1,000 times fewer than his electric Lincoln and his Pono music service. Even when major missing pieces of his ’70s catalog were patched in 2003, Time Fades Away was left to rot in the archives.Several theories have circulated to explain the conspicuous snub, most often returning to the cursed fog that hung over Young’s 1973 tour. Originally, the band was supposed to include Danny Whitten, Neil’s guitar foil in Crazy Horse—but, fighting drug addiction and alcoholism, Whitten couldn’t hack it at rehearsals in fall 1972, and he was fired and sent back to Los Angeles. That same night, he was found dead from an overdose of alcohol and Valium. Whitten’s death cast a shadow over the tour, which started the following January and wormed its way across the United States in a rigorous 62 shows in 90 days.The stories from the tour, as regaled in Young biographies, are like a nightmare version of Almost Famous, replete with drug indulgences, money arguments, audience riots, medical issues, and technical problems. Two-thirds of the way through, Neil’s vocal cords were shot, leading to show cancellations and inclusion of David Crosby and Graham Nash, to no great help. Young’s band the Stray Gators, the murderer’s row of session musicians from Harvest, didn’t translate to basketball arenas; drummer Kenny Buttrey had the worst time of it, with Young asking him to play louder and louder until he literally bled on his drums. Legendary producer and arranger Jack Nitzsche, playing piano, self-medicated his stage fright with alcohol; for his own part, Young spent the tour chugging tequila and trying out a new Gibson Flying V guitar instead of his totemic Old Black, his dissatisfaction with the sound leading to endless soundchecks and after-show spats.So this wasn’t exactly the tour you’d want to commemorate for eternity with a live album—but at least initially, Young was perversely excited to reflect its chaos, and left the recording mostly free of the overdubs that glossed many live albums of the era. “Money hassles among everyone concerned ruined this tour and record for me, but I released it anyway so you folks could see what could happen if you lose it for a while,” Young wrote in the liner notes of 1977’s Decade.But in retrospect, he was too harsh. The Stray Gators were one of Young’s most interesting bands: they were fragile, straining, and desperate. One could easily see where their heavier material, such as “Yonder Stands the Sinner” and “Last Dance,” would have fit Whitten-era Crazy Horse. Here, pedal steel wizard Ben Keith levels up from a classy hired hand on Harvest to assume Whitten’s role, his instrument providing wobbly, intoxicated howls that amplify the haunted mood. Nitzsche plays a deceptively clunky piano that turns “Time Fades Away” into a chicken-wire saloon and creeps with tinkling anxiety around the edges of “Last Dance.” When Crosby and Nash show up, they create an alternate-dimension CSNY that uses their harmonies as a weapon instead of a balm, with Young and Crosby’s “Yonder Stands the Sinner” choruses particularly deranged.Coming on the heels of the slick Harvest, Time Fades Away was a crucial swerve for Young, and it established the proudly flawed aesthetic that has kept his work immediate and powerful for decades. These are weary, acidic songs about the hollowness of stardom—recording them during a tour from hell is an asset, not a flaw. Even the crowd noise between songs heightens the despair—blissful, oblivious applause from an audience too remote to see Young’s naked pain. Songs previously lost on Time Fades Away are key parts of Young’s story. “Don’t Be Denied” is one of Young’s best autobiographical songs, wistfully telling the story of his Canadian childhood through Buffalo Springfield’s early days. “L.A.” is a wonderfully cynical kiss-off to the city where that band found stardom, a land of dreams beset by earthquakes, traffic, and smog.wBecause Zuma was packaged with the trilogy for the Record Store Day vinyl box set, there’s been some recent chatter of a “Ditch quadrilogy.” But Zuma is a poor fit with the other three; it’s a record made on a beach instead of On the Beach, a happy reunion and fresh beginning for Crazy Horse, and a goofy boys’ club hangout released only five months after Tonight’s the Night’s tortured slog. It hits the reset button in many ways—most literally with its opener, “Don’t Cry No Tears,” which recycles the melody from “I Wonder,” one of Young’s first recorded works with his high school band, the Squires.It also marked Young’s decision to reform Crazy Horse for the first time since Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, with new guitarist Frank “Poncho” Sampedro filling the big rhythm guitar shoes of Danny Whitten. That Young could even stomach replacing Whitten, two years after his death, signaled that the session in Malibu would be one of recovery and rebirth. That period was particularly debauched, with the recently divorced Young and his bandmates enjoyed the company of California girls and Colombian powder, and the party carried over into the “studio” (essentially just a room in producer David Briggs’ rental house). There, the new Crazy Horse got to know each other over some hastily written material, simplified to work with Poncho’s rudimentary guitar.This lackadaisical formula explains the uneven nature of Zuma, which is equally filled with classics and duds. “Cortez the Killer” and “Danger Bird” are two triumphantly moody, electric epics—lesser cousins to the “Down by the River”-style sprees of the first Crazy Horse, but still spacious opportunities for Young to revive his trademark lacerating guitar tone. It’s here that the sludgy Crazy Horse known today takes shape: the trade-out of the communicative Whitten for Sampedro’s simpler style creates that blunt sound. The rhythm section of Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina lurches menacingly through “Cortez” and “Danger Bird,” and Sampedro’s blocky guitar caddies for Young’s lengthy soloing.The album’s two other highlights revive a breezy, poppy Young that had been missing since After the Gold Rush. “Don’t Cry No Tears,” is simple twangy country-rock well in the Horse’s wheelhouse, gilded with innocent backing harmonies. “Barstool Blues,” despite being a fairly shameless rip of “It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue,” is a convincing and catchy depiction of drunken euphoria—and a pretty accurate portrait of Zuma’s making. On the less lovable side of the endless party, “Stupid Girl” is nowhere near good enough to justify its casual misogyny and title swipe from the Rolling Stones, and “Drive Back” is barely a song beneath its mighty riff and creepy piano. Leftovers tossed in from Homegrown (“Pardon My Heart”) and the aborted second CSNY record (“Through My Sails”) don’t quite fit the mood, presaging the less cohesive and spottier records over the rest of Young’s decade.Still, if Zuma is an epilogue to the Ditch Trilogy, it’s also a prologue to the rest of Young’s career, kicking off his fickle, impulsive zig-zagging between genres and volume levels. That restlessness would keep Young vital long after his peers faded—and it can be traced all the way back to the stoned sunsets of Malibu, where Young decided to cry no more tears and move onward down the road, swerving all the way.\"],[22305,\"Orphée, the latest album by the Icelandic composer and filmmaker Jóhann Jóhannsson is billed as his first studio album in six years since the somber and excellent The Miners’ Hymns. But during that time Jóhannsson has released eight records—three of which were scores to major films (including Sicario & The Theory of Everything) and the rest music for smaller film projects, one of which Jóhannsson directed himself. But with even The Miners’ Hymns itself serving as a score to a film, the particular criteria for which Jóhannsson deems a record to be a “studio album” as opposed to a “film score” is somewhat unclear. What is clear is that after years of albums on 4AD and small post-classical labels such as Fat Cat’s 130701, in moving to Deutsche Grammophon—the oldest and most significant classical music label left standing—Jóhannsson wants Orphée to be seen as a work of music propped up by nothing but itself and its own deserved grandeur.Loosely themed around Ovid's version of the Orpheus myth, Orphée’s grandeur is made clear within seconds. Using only a few repeated parts of piano, violin, and some crackling sound treatments, opener “Flight from the City” takes off. It feels like film music in a way that most of Orphée does not; you could easily imagine it playing over credits, or an opening scene, or in a mid-film montage. But the palette, tone, and structure of Orphée vary greatly and much of it embraces a compositional approach akin to ’90s chamber experimentalists the Rachel’s and others in the post-classical mold on 130701 or Erased Tapes. “A Song for Europa” features more of those crackling sound treatments as well as a recurring spectral vocal sample, while the stately “A Deal With Chaos” or “The Radiant City” would be at home on the Rachel’s Music for Egon Schiele.Apart from “Flight from the City,” the most unforgettable tracks on Orphée are where Jóhannsson adds more experimental textures, particularly in the penultimate diptych of “Good Morning, Midnight” and “Good Night, Day.” In a way, these two tracks play out the climax of the Orpheus myth: The former begins with dreamy slow-waltz strings and burbling sound effects that connote the gait of a person heading toward destiny unknown, before giving way to a close-mic'd solo piano piece that sounds like the ruminative thoughts of man by way of Satie-style impressionism. The latter, “Good Night, Day,” begins with repeated string warnings that plays as a realization of chased dreams lost, with a cello melody serving as an elegiac narrative counterpoint. On each, the blend of early 20th-century modalities and experimental recording approaches make them archetypal post-classical tracks.Boldest of all is Orphée’s a capella closer “Orphic Hymn,” which features a breathtaking choral vocal performance by Paul Hillier’s Theatre of Voices of text from Ovid’s The Metamorphoses. Sung vocals are rarely found in Jóhannsson’s work, but the angelic arrangement makes you wish that he had found more opportunities to integrate vocals into the rest of the record. “Orphic Hymn” also brings Jóhannsson back full circle to British post-classical elder statesman Michael Nyman. The piece strongly recalls the longing of “Miserere” from The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, a great example of how Nyman’s scores work as independent music woven into a film rather than applied to the surface of scenes.It’s exciting to hear the freedom of Jóhannsson’s compositions in autonomous music, and with Orphée he’s reasserted himself as not a just an elegiac film score guy. As good as his cinema work has been, the act of telling someone else’s story puts limits on both an artist’s freedom to work and the impact of how they might be received, and Jóhannsson likely isn’t looking to become known as “the Next Thomas Newman.” The voice he uses on Orphée says otherwise, and provides a clear blast attestation that Jóhannsson is among the brightest lights of any member of the loosely grouped post-classical genre.\"],[22238,\"On the eponymous opening track of his 1968 debut, small town Bahian boy Tom Zé sang of his adopted hometown São Paulo with ambivalence. “São São Paulo quanta dor\\/São São Paulo meu amor” went the chorus, alternating between pain and affection in describing the smokestacks and traffic jams of the sprawling megalopolis, its bustling populace of eight million described as “crowded loneliness.” While the most populous and industrious city in Brazil, culturally São Paulo has always stood in the shadow of Rio de Janeiro. It was known as samba's grave.But as the compilation Desconstrução proves, the musicians clustered around São Paulo’s current “samba sujo” (dirty samba) scene relish their hometown’s pallor. For those struck by the sound of Elza Soares’ A Mulher do Fim do Mundo from a few months ago, this twelve-track comp culled from the early days of the Goma Gringa Discos label is the next logical step in exploring modern Brazilian music. It features a similar cast of players and musicians from Soares’ album, including saxophonist\\/arranger Thiago França and Rodrigo Campos. And much like Soares’ late-period masterpiece, Descontrução places songs wild with fusion against contemplative and arresting moments of quiet. From Campos’ hushed and simmering noise ballad “Ribeirão” to the roiling acid-rock tinged conjured by trio Metá Metá on “Rainha Das Cabecas,” each act expertly navigates through these influences to produce an exhilarating array that escapes easy classification. Most acts rotate through a stable of players, be they Juçara Marçal, Kiko Dinucci, Marcelo Cabral, Romulo Fróes, Sérgio Machado, Campos, or França, which the press release states “are not a movement, [but] togetherness in motion, always linked from one project to the next.” Almost any selection here contains strands of native samba, post-punk’s rumble, Afrobeat’s driving rhythm, blats of avant-jazz that seem to dilate space, as well as flashbacks to ’60s Tropicália, itself a mutation of Brazilian pop music interacting with outside influences. But it’s one thing to just jump from influence to influence, and another to make each gestural leap and genre shift feline and graceful. Thiago França’s contributions might be the most deft of the set, “Space Charanga” bringing to mind the open-ended, exploratory jazz of Kamasi Washington or Charles Mingus’ own Cumbia & Jazz Fusion. It’s tight and lyrical, able to fly up into fiery spiritual jazz stratosphere while also staying firmly grounded in rhythm. Meanwhile “Na Multidão” is a quicksilver track that avoids drums entirely, drawing its pulse from filigrees of electric guitar and upright bass, punctuated with quick jabs of brass and droning woodwinds.Serving as elder statesman for this clutch of musicians is Vicente Barreto, whose career—much like Soares—dates back to the early ’60s and also include many vicissitudes of fortune. Barreto collaborated with everyone from Vinicius de Moraes to Tom Zé on his 1978 album Correio Da Estação Do Brás. The guitars blare like sirens and grow increasingly anxious, but Barreto’s gravitas keeps the song from flying apart. The comp’s most gorgeous moment shows another side of Metá Metá. The trio’s hushed “Obatalá” brings to mind everything from early ’00s freak-folk to Gilberto Gil’s ethereal “Futurível.” With little more than a wordless whispered vocal and a plinking guitar figure that hovers over flutters of saxophone, they evoke an unspeakable beauty. Both guitar and horn teeter on the edge of extended-technique noise. But as their atonal din grows, the group strikes the perfect balance, conveying something sublime amid such noise, a bloom of color amid the gray. \"],[22350,\"Detroit is a city of extremes—of Fortune 500 wealth and epidemic poverty, of beautiful art-deco landmarks and ruins that are so apocalyptic, they’ve spawned a mini-tourism industry. Native son Jack White has likewise displayed a fondness for blinding contrasts, and the White Stripes’ candy-cane dress code was the least of it. Over the years, White has gamely pit bluesy authenticity against bullshit artistry; virtuosity against amateurism; punk credibility against Hollywood celebrity; small-business boosterism against Coca-Cola shilling. He’s a garage-rocker who’d rather chill on the front porch, a man who can write songs that fill football stadiums even though sports might just make him miserable.Those paradoxical qualities have ultimately elevated White’s songbook above mere blues-rock revivalism. That tension is baked right into his music, where the scorching six-string pyrotechnics have routinely been hosed down by soothing sing-alongs. He’s an electric warrior and eccentric warbler, a Page and Plant in one perfect rock-star package. If he didn’t exist, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction committee would have to will him into existence.However, a new collection wants you to think of White less as a self-mythologizing guitar god and more as a humble storyteller. Though its title may suggest a bounty of rough-draft demos, Acoustic Recordings 1998-2016 is really a straightforward, chronological cherry-pick of the songs in White’s discography (peppered with alternate mixes) that don’t feature electric guitar as the primary instrument. It’s White without the red, a Starbucks-worthy sanitization of a scuzz-rock icon. But even though it lops off one side of White’s split personality, Acoustic Recordings still provides a vivid portrait of White’s evolution over the past 18 years; like a phantom limb, the absence of noise becomes a form of presence.As the compilation reasserts, White has been writing on an acoustic since day one, however, the kinds of acoustic songs he writes have changed considerably over the years. On the first White Stripes album, “Sugar Never Tasted So Good” offered White a chance to exhale between garage-rock grunts, though this suggestive serenade was spiritually in tune with that record’s devil-music worship. But already on 2000’s De Stijl, White was using the acoustic format less as an unplugged antidote and more a foundation for experimentation. With the radiant “I’m Bound to Pack It Up,” he used modest Zeppelin III means to telegraph Houses of the Holy ambitions. And on White Blood Cells hits like “Hotel Yorba” and “We’re Going to Be Friends,” the Stripes’ acoustic side became as crucial to constructing their childlike fantasias as their block-rockin’ rave-ups.Acoustic Recordings’ first disc—charting the backwoods path to the Stripes’ 2007 swan song Icky Thump—could essentially be replicated by any Stripes completist dragging album tracks into a playlist. (The lone prize find is the hushed Get Behind Me Satan outtake, “City Lights,” the rare acoustic White tune to showcase the sort of guitar wizardry he brings to his electric repertoire.) So it’s appropriate that the more revelatory second disc should kick off with the first official release of “Love Is the Truth,” the winsome 2006 Coca-Cola jingle that symbolically came out around the same time White finally ditched Detroit-scene politics to set up shop in Nashville, heralding his transformation into a multimedia mogul. (The move also coincided with the formation of his supergroup the Raconteurs, represented here by countrified alternate takes of “Top Yourself” and “Carolina Drama.”)Once the timeline reaches White’s 2012 solo debut, Blunderbuss, the Acoustic Recordings concept practically becomes moot, as the 90\\/10 ratio of electric\\/acoustic songs that once governed White Stripes records had effectively reversed (perhaps because White was channeling his most aggressive impulses to the Dead Weather). If White’s early acoustic material conveyed a certain bedsit intimacy, the vibe here is more communal kitchen-party hootenanny. With a wide cast of Music City pros at his side, tracks like “Hip (Eponymous) Poor Boy” and “On and On and On” key in on the homespun spirit of the Band, the Faces, and Exile-era Stones. At this point for White, stripping down means gussying up: with its barrelhouse piano, fiddles and gospelized backing vocals, the “acoustic mix” of the Lazaretto romp “Just One Drink” is essentially honky-tonk glam-rock. In his journey from the Gold Dollar to the White House, the blues has remained foundational to White’s acoustic songwriting, though, these days, it’s less about the bare-bones style than an existential state of mind. His acoustic catalog used to be a space where he could reveal a more gentle, whimsical side. But in his sometimes fraught adjustment to A-list celebrity—with all the publicized fistfights, divorces, shit-talking, and lawsuits that have come with it—White’s conversational writing has, at times, turned more tense and terse. “I want love to\\/Change my friends to enemies\\/And show me how it’s all my fault,” he seethes on Blunderbuss’ “Love Interruption” like a man scorned, and that wariness would become further entrenched on Lazaretto’s “Entitlement”: “Every time I’m doing what I want to, somebody comes and tells me it’s wrong\\/Whenever I’m doing just as I please, somebody cuts me down to me knees.”More than just showcasing his tuneful side, Acoustic Recordings is a shrine to White’s self-sufficiency, in both the musical and ideological senses. After all, White has always been one to take matters into his own hands, whether he’s building guitars from some spare wire and wood, opening his own record press, or ensuring aliens have access to a turntable. And until he can get off this godforsaken planet and join his records in space, Acoustic Recordings stockpiles a great American songbook that can endure even after we’re all forced to live off the grid.\"],[22356,\"Despite his unassailable stature as a literary giant, modernist trailblazer, and fringe icon, we continue to sell William Burroughs short by the way we remember him. The late author is celebrated for his unparalleled ability to disfigure the language, both via his “cut-up” approach to non-linear narrative flow and also for the unrelenting hideousness of his subject matter. But let’s imagine, by comparison, that Jackson Pollock or John Coltrane had gone down in history solely for the audacious splatter of their technique, rather than the innate grace they brought to those techniques.In Burroughs’ case, even though he structured several of his key works so that readers can start on any page and work through the text in any order, we shouldn’t ignore his gift for putting words together in the first place. If it weren’t for their underlying lyricism, Burroughs’ harrowing portraits of heroin use and pederasty wouldn’t have the arresting impact that they continue to have more than half a century later. And yet, after all that time, even highly creative artists like composer\\/instrumentalist Elliott Sharp and actor Steve Buscemi miss the mark. Both of them should know better. A live performance that took place as part of a month-long celebration of Burroughs’ birthday centennial in 2014, Rub Out the Word will likely satisfy the author’s most avid cheerleaders, but anyone looking for a fresh take should look elsewhere (such as Burroughs’ spoken-word collaborations with the bands Material, the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, and his 1990 album of readings with various artists, Dead City Radio). It’s not that Buscemi and Sharp don’t mean well, or that they don’t bring a great deal of attention to their respective crafts here. They also deserve credit for not fetishizing Burroughs’ most reprehensible qualities (i.e: his unapologetic fascination with guns even after recklessly killing his second wife with one, and his celebrity among junkies as “the pope of dope”). And yet the pair apparently couldn’t resist looking at their subject through a superficial lens.Rub Out the Word zigzags between the author’s prose and his musings on the art of writing itself. On paper, it would seem as if Sharp chose wisely from the vast body of text that Burroughs left behind, especially where Buscemi recites passages that tease at offering insight into the author’s process. It is in this area that Rub Out the Word fails the most to deliver on its potential. Unfortunately, Buscemi and Sharp fall into the trap of being seduced by the cut-up technique as the defining aspect of Burroughs’ legacy. They even unwittingly ring the death knell for this album right off the bat, when Buscemi reads, “What better way to invoke a writer than to cut and re-arrange his very own words? Like all keys to be used with caution, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.” Too true, as this album would've benefitted hugely from a mix of random and structured flow. Sharp, presumably taken by his attraction to chaos theory, copy\\/pasted Burroughs' texts and ran them through an online word scrambler, an unnecessary step akin to filtering an innovative guitarist's parts through the same effects pedal twice.Burroughs was capable of keeping readers spellbound through the jagged shifts in his train of thought, but it’s obvious within this album’s first few minutes that the cut-up technique doesn’t have the same verve in spoken form that it does on paper—at least not the way it’s delivered here. As an extended oral work, Rub Out the Word simply lacks coherence. And though Sharp’s eerie background drones complement the more nightmarish passages, what begins as a compelling exercise in texture ultimately falls flat from a lack of sonic variety or buildup. Which leaves the spotlight on Buscemi’s stylized voice, an egregious affectation that the material just didn’t need. Buscemi actually breathes life into the final track “Taking the Virus” by reading in a rapid-fire, low-pitched whisper that conjures images of an auctioneer making a hushed speech at a funeral. The difference between the vocal technique on this piece and the previous ones is startling. It also shows how much Burroughs’ writing breathes when subjected to new interpretations. Buscemi treats “Taking the Virus” like a script where he has room to invent the narrator’s character, which works wonders. And when Buscemi slows down, he does so with the agility of a seasoned musician. The shift in pacing is revelatory and also creates room for Sharp’s accompaniment to shine through. It’s the one moment where Rub Out the Word has dynamics and dimension. By that point, though, it’s far too late.\"],[22112,\"The style known as electro has no single origin, but its lineage can be traced back to a few fairly clear antecedents. Afrika Bambaataa and Soulsonic Force’s 1982 single “Planet Rock” canonized the syncopated rhythmic cadence, played on the Roland TR-808 drum machine, that is central to the style; that song was partly inspired by the lurching, snapping beat of Kraftwerk’s “Numbers,” from 1981. The Germans had probably been listening to Yellow Magic Orchestra’s Ryuichi Sakamoto, who deployed the same whip-crack syncopations on 1980’s “Riot in Lagos.” But beating them all to the punch was a Miami group called Herman Kelly & Life, who laid down that signature beat in 1978, in a rousing Latin funk song called “Dance to the Drummer’s Beat” that would go on to be a major influence on Miami bass, a regional variant of electro.Electro’s Latin roots have often been overlooked, but they’re at the center of Afro-Cuban Electronics, the debut album from Miami’s Alpha 606, which fuses the booming and hissing 808s of classic electro with congas, clave, guiro, and other Afro-Cuban percussion instruments. The project dates back to the early 2000s. Originally, it was a group comprising producers Armando Martinez and Rey Rubio and percussionists Marino Hernandez and Danny Chirino, all of Cuban descent (Hernandez, in fact, arrived on Floridian shores in 1980’s Mariel boatlift). They put out their debut EP in 2005, with a remix from fellow Miami electro experimentalists Phoenecia. By 2008, when Detroit’s Interdimensional Transmissions label released the Electrónica Afro-Cubano EP, only Martinez remained, and he continues solo on Afro-Cuban Electronics.The sound of the music will be familiar to anyone who has heard Hashim’s “Al Naafiysh (The Soul),” Newcleus’ “Jam on It,” or any other classic in the electro pantheon; one of electro’s salient features it that it simply doesn’t change very much. It all comes down to syncopated 808 patterns, skeletal synth bass, and not much more, and Martinez remains faithful to the blueprint. Even without the Afro-Cuban addition, electro enthusiasts would find plenty to love here: His rhythms move with the easy grace of a jungle cat flicking its tail; his drums are as crisp as you could ask for, and his synthesizers shimmer with a vivid, sci-fi sheen.But the added percussion greatly adds to the music’s dynamism, filling in the empty space with rolling rhythmic counterpoints. On “Shake,” the two opposing rhythmic figures—guiro and clave patterns against snapping kicks and claps—bob like double needles on a sewing machine, zipping in and out of each other’s way. The Latin percussion also does wonders for the music’s tone colors, lending a warm, glassy glow to the Roland’s dry thump and scratch. Often, Martinez leaves his percussion elements relatively unadulterated, but occasionally, as on “Endangered Cuban Crocodile,” he leans hard on the effects, running the congas through heavy compression and reverb; the results sound a little like if Warp’s Artificial Intelligence compilations had an explicit Latin underpinning.Martinez does his best to keep things varied; tempos range from a skulking, 110-BPM four-to-the-floor up to 170-BPM rollers. Still, at 13 tracks and nearly an hour (plus a different bonus cut on both the vinyl and digital editions), the album feels a little long. For the most part, these are drum workouts, not songs, per se, and the palette begins to blur together by the record’s end, even with two vocal tracks to break things up.On “Engineered Floatation Device” (sic), the heavily processed vocals speak to the experience of Cuban exiles who fled their island home in small boats and rafts, and the song is dark and alluring, with a silver lining of a synthesizer arpeggio. “Defection” covers similar ground, but its chanted couplets and militant theme—“Defection was our only choice\\/It happened when you first oppressed our voice\\/We did not retreat from the attack\\/ We’ve been deep in the swamp working our way back”—feel a little like empty bravado. And the fact that Cuba’s exiled “freedom fighters” left a trail of blood behind them might leave a bad taste in the listener’s mouth: Alpha 606 is named in tribute to Alpha 66, an anti-Castro paramilitary group, founded by Cuban exiles, that allegedly carried out terrorist attacks on tourist targets in Cuba. The style of the track is clearly meant to recall Drexciya, the Detroit electro act who created an Afrofuturist mythology around a supposed race of subaquatic beings who were born to pregnant women thrown overboard during the Middle Passage. But Drexciya’s underwater resistance was an imaginary conceit, and a utopian one at that. Alpha 606 is best when it lets the drums do the talking, and the only thing that goes boom is the kick on the 808.\"],[22309,\"There’s a degree of would-be myth to Adam Torres’ backstory. He first gained some local notoriety as an undergraduate in Athens, Ohio in the middle of the ’00s, performing solo shows and playing guitar for indie-folk outfit Southeast Engine, heroes of that Ohio scene. In 2006, he self-released his first solo album at the age of 20, Nostra Nova, an album that developed a cult-classic status in the decade since, and a slightly greater visibility upon its reissue via Misra Records last year. While whispers slowly spread of this songwriter you’d never heard of, Torres himself was mostly absent in those ensuing ten years before returning with Pearls to Swine, his first full-fledged release since Nostra Nova. All those years removed from Nostra Nova it sounds like he returned as a ghost. Torres spent some time volunteering in Ecuador before resettling to Austin, TX to earn his graduate degree and work to help improve the water quality of the Rio Grande, all while releasing a spate of lo-fi demos he recorded in his closet. On Pearls to Swine, his songs are earnest and full of yearning, yet still difficult to divine the concrete relatability that lives within. It transcends his humble Ohio roots, a work of startling beauty that sits in your head like a half-remembered dream: you keep returning to it, trying to approach it from different angles and catch the secrets you’re missing before they slip away into the haze.Torres’ voice is without a doubt the thing he’s known for and will be remembered by. It has an unearthly quality. Throughout Pearls To Swine, he sings in a ruminative falsetto that is able to bend in directions that defy the shape and scope of the human form. In the album’s stunning opener, “Juniper Arms,” he begins in near-wordlessness, a place he coasts in and out of before occasionally dropping back down to earth for a bit of clarity. The song is about Albuquerque, where Torres was born, as well as Austin, where he lives, but the words “Juniper arms” are the only ones in focus during the chorus. It’s like Torres tries to wrap his arms around the idea of home while drifting around it just out of reach.There are more traditional moments like “High Lonesome” and “Morning Rain,” moments where Torres remains front-and-center over finger-picked guitar parts, where you could hear him as a compromise between Neil Young’s ’70s broken-angel croon and Jeff Buckley’s celestial melodies. Then there are the counterpoints where he lets himself go to those otherworldly places, like when his voice and the strings meld into one unsettling current in “Daydream.” He has a way of crafting songs that lure you out with their beauty before revealing its underlying rage. Though Torres’ gorgeous and idiosyncratic voice is a major selling point of Pearls to Swine, it’s bolstered by his meditations on the tangible experience, much of it derived from the life Torres lived between records. Just as the experiences that birthed Nostra Nova were inextricably rooted in small college-town circuits and in the music community in Athens, the new record feels at one with the Texas landscape. There’s a sweeping whine in the string drone of “Outlands,” like wind coursing across the Chihuahuan Desert. It feels like a return journey after traversing the desolation and spending the bulk of a decade removed from his calling.  That gives the penultimate track, “Mountain River,” a climactic tone with Torres singing “I’m trying to find my way back home” all before the epilogue of “City Limits.” A tension permeates these songs: Torres sounds road-weary, but also like he’s trying to grasp the wonder that’s still out there in America. It’s a tension that many artists working in some strain of contemporary Americana touch on, like those cosmic Americana troubadours Ryley Walker, Steve Gunn, and William Tyler. It won’t reproduce the same kind of direct, intimate engagement the once-unknown Nostra Nova did. But Torres has traded away some pieces of the humanity that colored his earlier work in favor of a conversation about something elemental that's still waiting to be discovered. That doesn’t make for an immediate record. It makes for one full of enigmas, of beautiful and undefinable things that promise further revelations to come.\"],[22345,\"Producer Manfred Eicher first heard the music of Arvo Pärt on the radio, while driving down the highway. The dramatic string writing and bell-like piano of Tabula Rasa made him pull over and think about expanding his offerings. Until then, Eicher’s ECM imprint had focused mostly on jazz. While his label’s discography included a few modern classical composers like Steve Reich, it didn’t feature a wide range of contemporary notated music. But after Eicher’s conversion on the Autobahn, ECM’s “New Series” was born. The first release from Eicher’s expanded classical lineup was a collection of Pärt’s instrumental works, issued in 1984. That album assumed a delicate profile during quieter passages and projected resonant lushness in its more grave sections. Those interpretations have never been bested, and Pärt has worked closely with ECM ever since. While Eicher’s airy production can occasionally tread close to a “new age” aesthetic, this has served Pärt well. After a youthful run that saw the composer mixing religious music with wild-eyed modernism, Pärt’s mature writing tends to employ a blend of centuries-old chant styles and contemplative, minimalist orchestration. This lower-key approach to experimentalism benefits from the clarity of Eicher’s mastering. In the early going of The Deer’s Cry , “the ECM sound” allows Pärt’s strangeness to hit with a paradoxical serenity. The opening moments of “Von Angesicht zu Angesicht”—a setting of the “through a glass, darkly” portion of 1 Corinthians—are pensive but also gorgeous, as string lines and a doleful clarinet wind around supple choral writing. During the soprano vocalist’s solo, however, a soft dissonance is held at the end of one line. What once seemed an attractive bauble now appears more unsettling (and in tune with its source text).It’s these moves that keep Pärt’s attractive music from relaxing into any “easy listening” format. The desperate nature of his search for the beautiful is rarely far from view. The title track’s words attest to the presence of Christ on all sides of the singers. But the lamentation of Pärt’s harmonies is so extreme, it’s natural to wonder about our ease of access to the divine. Because he turned to Christianity during the Soviet era, Pärt suffered censure for his choice of devotional texts—and it’s difficult to miss the hard-won toughness that resides in his spiritual music. The Estonian vocal ensemble Vox Clamantis displays admirable command of the composer’s art. The pieces are mostly miniatures, drawn from multiple decades of Pärt’s output. Several have been recorded before. But the takes by Vox Clamantis always tease out something new. In the finale from Kanon Pokajanen, they offer a brighter sound than previously heard on ECM. And their renditions of more popular Pärt fare (such as “Da pacem Domine”) are dependably excellent. Fans of the composer may have heard as much as half of this program in other interpretations. Yet the performances and engineering here argue persuasively for new experiences of this music. The same way that Eicher’s first album of Pärt’s music offered a sampling of his instrumental pieces, The Deer’s Cry is a useful entry point to the composer’s vocal music. Its overall effect is not quite as potent as those of long-form compositions such as Miserere or Litany, but there are still plenty of moments that can stop you in your tracks.\"],[22255,\"In the history books, it was on March 31st, 1964 that a military coup ousted Brazilian President João Goulart. The U.S.-backed junta overtook all branches of government, ending nearly a century of newfound democracy for the one-time adjunct of the Portuguese empire and subjecting the country to two decades of increasingly repressive military rule. In Caetano Veloso’s 2003 memoir Tropical Truth: A Story of Music & Revolution in Brazil, he is adamant that the date is a lie: The coup actually took place on April Fool’s Day. Four years into the new regime, then-twentysomething Brazilian pop singer Veloso recorded his first solo album.But the first voice you hear on his 1968 self-titled release isn’t that of Veloso, but of Portuguese knight Pêro Vaz de Caminha, credited with discovering Brazil in the year 1500. He wrote a letter to Manuel I, King of Portugal raving about the fertile Brazilian land and how “all that is planted grows and flourishes,” convincing the king that the presumed island was worthy of colonization. Carta de Pero Vaz Caminha is considered the first literary text to emanate from Brazil but it gets parodied in a high nasally voice by Veloso’s drummer Dirceu. Little did the percussionist know that the tapes were running. And when the arranger of the session mimics the “exotic” sounds of the Brazilian rainforest, it points back to that time when Brazil was virgin land, before the empire arrived at her shores.Caetano Veloso’s debut album remains one of the most revolutionary albums released into the worldwide tumult of the 1960s. The opening salvo of Tropicália, it announced the arrival of the greatest Brazilian talent since João Gilberto and launched a fifty-year career that’s not only changed Brazilian music but American music as well, from Talking Heads to Beck to No Wave legend Arto Lindsay and Animal Collective. To non-Portuguese speakers, Caetano Veloso might not sound anywhere near as transformative as the other albums of that year: Electric Ladyland, The White Album, White Light\\/White Heat, Anthem of the Sun, A Saucerful of Secrets, to name just a few. Couched in lush orchestral strings suggestive of the generation prior instead of the psychedelic production effects of the moment, it’s a sound thoughtfully strummed on an acoustic guitar. It has few of the tricks and technology of the aforementioned, but at its heart, it’s a revolt, a message delivered at a purr rather than a howl, elegantly gliding past military censors. At the time, the album struck a balance between the polemics of communism on the Left and the crushing military might on the Right, sloughing off the nationalism and patriotism on either side while embracing a love of country in the shadow of the American Empire. And at the center of it all was Veloso and his supple, silken voice, a Bing Crosby croon delivered with a glint in his eye and Che Guevara’s The Motorcycle Diaries surreptitiously tucked into his back pocket.The seeds of Tropicália’s revolution were planted the year prior when Veloso submitted “Alegria, Alegria” (“Joy, Joy”) to the TV Record Festival. Featuring a burst of fuzz guitar and electric organ it became Veloso’s first anthem, his self-described “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.” It’s also his Breathless, his “Chicken Noodle Soup,” at once a critique and embrace of 20th-century pop culture. Veloso drinks Coca-Cola, quotes Sartre, name-drops Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale, all while slyly quoting fellow Brazilian pop star Chico Buarque’s “A Banda” and shrugging his shoulders at the end with the line: “Why not?” It set the themes for the movement to come in Tropicália: courting mass media, distancing themselves from the Left and silently protesting the powers that be. As Veloso later told the New York Times: “It was against the dictatorship without saying anything about it.”The success of “Alegria, Alegria” emboldened Veloso as he worked on a new album. During lunch at a friend’s house one day, he sang some of the new songs, including one that still didn’t have a title. Brazilian film producer and screenwriter Luiz Carlos Barreto suggested the name of a recent piece from visual artist Hélio Oiticica, an installation that required the viewer to follow a path through sand, lined with tropical plants, until they ended at a television set. “Until I could find a better title the song would be called ‘Tropicália,’” Veloso wrote. “I never did find a better one.”“Tropicália” opens with Dirceu’s recitation about Brazil as a “tropical paradise,” shouted amid a clatter of jungle drums, tympani, shakers, agogô bells, and the piercingly high frequency of flutes imitating bird song, before the orchestra strikes up and Veloso ambles in like a giant surveying all of Brazil:Over my head the airplanesUnder my feet the trucks and trainsAnd pointing out the highland plains is my noseI organize the movement, tooI lead the carnival.As expansive, outsized, and hallucinatory as Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself,” as insouciant and word-drunk as Bob Dylan’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues,” “Tropicália” is allegory and absorption of all the contradictions of Brazil: its baião rhythms against suave orchestral surges, its colonial opening against the overstuffed modernist lines of Veloso. In the chorus, Veloso praises the sophisticated and urbane song form of bossa nova yet rhymes it with “mud huts.” Throughout the dense lines, Veloso swings from jungle to city, from swimming pools to sea, referring to fellow Música Popular Brasileira (MPB) singers like Elis Regina, Roberto Carlos, and—at the last refrain—to Buarque’s “A Banda” again. Though this time, Veloso adds a twist, rhyming it with the lady in the Tutti Frutti hat, Carmen Miranda.By that point in the ’60s, Miranda was perceived as kitsch, the Brazil of old, even though early in her singing career, the “Brazilian Bombshell” was her country’s first full-fledged pop star and one of the highest paid entertainers in Hollywood. But Veloso was sincere in his embrace of Miranda, and in teasing out the last syllable of her name, he also nods to Dadaism, melding colorful camp and the avant-garde in just a handful of syllables.“One characteristic of Tropicália... was precisely the broadening and diversification of the market, achieved through a dismantling of the order of things, with a disregard for distinctions of class or level of education.” So Veloso wrote in Tropical Truth, adding that one goal of their movement was “to sort out the tension between Brazil the Parallel Universe and Brazil the country peripheral to the American Empire.” It was a fine line to straddle, embracing both their own heritage and American pop culture. It meant admiring the colorful cartoonishness of the Kool-Aid Man but neither buying nor drinking the Kool-Aid, all while not falling for the consumerism being offered up religiously since the junta took power.***The American poet Elizabeth Bishop traveled to Brazil in the early ’50s. A two-week voyage turned into an 18-year stay in the country, where her aristocratic spouse, Lota de Macedo Soares, fed her access to the upper echelons of Rio society. Bishop found herself with a bird’s-eye view of the coup d’etat that would soon grip the country. She marveled at its efficiency and the support it appeared to engender, writing that these displays of anti-communism were becoming “victory marches [with] more than one million people marching in the rain.” From her perspective, it was simple: “...all in about 48 hours, it was all over...The suspension of rights, dismissing lots of Congress, etc... had to be done—sinister as it may sound.” But for the Brazilians who weren’t in positions of power and prominence, those in the favelas or those in the working classes who would not stand to profit handsomely, something far more sinister loomed.In the United States, a group of economists began to impose a debilitating economic plan around the world through means of torture and suppression. Naomi Klein’s book The Shock Doctrine traces this nefarious economic shock therapy from Iraq in the 2000s back to Indonesia in 1965. But its earliest iterations took place in South America. In 1962, Brazil had elected João Goulart, who Klein writes was “committed to land redistribution, higher salaries and a daring plan to force foreign multinationals to reinvest a percentage of their profits back into the Brazilian economy rather than spiriting them out of the country and distributing them to shareholders in New York and London.” It was a dynamic attempt to close the gap between the rich and poor in the country. But less than two years later, the U.S.-backed junta ousted the president and—with an economic policy scripted in the White House—instilled a plan “not merely to reverse João Goulart’s pro-poor programs but to crack Brazil wide open to foreign investment.” In just a few short years, most of Brazil’s wealth was in the hands of a few multinational corporations and the income gap widened, never to be narrowed again. That inequality remains today, exemplified by the Olympic Games in Rio. The political corruption and abject poverty lie just beyond the colorful walls erected to keep the favelas out of sight on our television screens.And as the people took to the streets to protest the economic hardships befalling them, it was these same corporations behind the violent repression that soon followed. In Brasil: Nunca Mais, a book that detailed the dictatorship’s torture record from 1964 until democracy was restored in the 1980s, the extralegal forces that brutalized unions, student groups, and other dissidents were funded “by contributions from various multinational corporations, including Ford and General Motors.”These nefarious forces at work were neither observed by the ’60s counterculture in the United States (then protesting for civil rights and against the Vietnam War) nor for most of the Brazilians themselves. As Veloso noted of the time, “Almost all of us were unaware of those nuances back then, and even if we had been, it would have changed nothing; we saw the coup simply as a decision to halt the redress of the horrible social inequalities in Brazil.”But even if the young Veloso wasn’t consciously aware of the corporations sucking his country dry, his lyrics suggest an awareness of something terribly amiss. It’s a line that runs through the work of all who gathered under the banner of Tropicália: fellow Bahian Gilberto Gil; the psychedelic wunderkind trio Os Mutantes; bossa nova singers Gal Costa and Nara Leão; the wry, live wire Tom Zé; Rogério Duprat, the producer who studied with Karlheinz Stockhausen. While Tropicália earned the ire of the Left by not writing overtly political songs, in tapping into the collective disquiet of the time, their songs became all the more resonant.Mocking his corporate overlords and their thirst for profit, Veloso made a tangy MPB album perfect for public consumption his first time out, his artful pop becoming Pop Art becoming agitprop. “Paisagem Útil” (“Useful Landscape”) scans as a string-laced bossa nova that toys with the title of Tom Jobim’s “Inútil Paisagem\\\\\" (“Useless Landscape”). It’s an ode to Brazil where Veloso offers up a love of Rio's city lights and speeding cars, his lovers kissing under the glow of an Esso sign, a romantic scene set in a simulacrum of nature under the auspices of that multinational oil company. The speedy “Superbacana” is a frevo as penned by Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. The titular hero “Supercool” battles Uncle Scrooge and his battalion of cowboy minions and uses advertising lingo for shiny new products like “super-peanut” and “biotonic spinach” and—amid the dizzying blur of slogans—“economic advances.”Translate the title of the jaunty “Soy Loco Por Ti, America” and it reads as “I Am Crazy for You, America.” And at the time, the Tropicálistas were eagerly absorbing as much music as possible from their neighbors to the north. “We were ‘eating’ the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix,” Veloso said of their influences at the time. “We wanted to participate in the worldwide language both to strengthen ourselves as a people and to affirm our originality.” They fervently spun albums from the likes of Aretha Franklin, Janis Joplin, Frank Zappa, and more, but rather than simply mimic the trends to the north, they made these influences bear out the music of their half of the hemisphere. So on “Soy Loco,” Caetano isn’t being cheeky about loving America, it’s just that he means South America. The song playfully dances between a Colombian cumbia and a Cuban mambo, sung in Portuguese and Spanish, with Veloso hoping for a united South America rather than the North American Empire. The lyrics toy with the notion of naming, be it the name of America or the girl he plans to bring to the beach (Marti), but then Veloso pivots and he sings of a nameless country.Fun enough beach fare, until Veloso signifies a dead man whose name can’t be said. He continues to land on this figure: “The name of the dead man\\/Before the permanent night spreads through Latin America\\/The name of the man\\/Is the people.” Less than a year prior, on the other side of the Brazilian border in Bolivia, Che Guevara was captured and killed by CIA-assisted forces. It would be decades before Veloso would admit that Che Guevara was the dead man at the center of the song, but with his death, the prospects of a united Latin and South America were imperiled. And in the years ahead, Brazil remained under the heel of the American Empire.As Tropicália grew in popularity around the country, Veloso began to see more attention from the authorities. A performance with Os Mutantes for Festival Internacional de Canção in September of 1968 became a riotous confrontation with the audience. Soon after, another show featuring Veloso, Gil, and Os Mutantes was staged under another piece of art from Hélio Oiticica. Only this one featured a man recently shot dead by the police with the slogan “seja marginal, seja heroi” (be a criminal, be a hero) written on it. By the end of the year, both Veloso and Gilberto Gil were arrested by the military police and detained two months in solitary confinement without being charged with a crime. After being allowed to play a farewell concert, they were then exiled from Brazil for the next four years. Living in London and then in Bahia upon his return in 1972, Veloso continued to record albums that were by turns exquisite, experimental, and introspective. Veloso recalled an interrogation from an army sergeant during his imprisonment: “The sergeant was revealing that we tropicalistas were the most serious enemies of the regime. But in that little room of the army police, I did not have the strength to feel proud: I was merely afraid.” None of that fear can be heard here. Instead, bravado and bold assurance run through every number. At the center of it all is Veloso, with his swagger and full belief in the power of his songs to dance around the tanks and petroleum companies, to triumph over both the CIA and Uncle Scrooge. Amid the album’s blinding color and tropical fronds that would make Carmen Miranda proud, Veloso made a stand against the dictatorship without saying anything about it.\"],[22327,\"As fans of the early-’90s television series and film well know, “Twin Peaks” is a staging ground for conflict between two supernatural locations (or “lodges,” or something). In a famously wigged-out dream sequence, at the the close of the show’s third episode, FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper hears an early clue suggesting the nature of this mysterious peril: “One chants out between two worlds: ‘Fire walk with me.’” But by then, the show's soundtrack has already revealed that this town in rural Washington is being manipulated by competing forces. The contest between them is demonstrated every few minutes, thanks to a sweetly naive motif (\\\\\"Twin Peaks Theme\\\\\") that can quickly give way to an unsettlingly morbid riff (\\\\\"Laura Palmer's Theme\\\\\"). One goes heavy on the piano’s white keys; the other meditates over some black ones.  As the show’s mix of humor and tragedy unfolds, these two compositions guide a viewer’s ability to perceive which mood is holding greater sway. A pleasant moment may end with a startling musical suggestion of horror. Or two characters locked in mutual grief may suddenly find something to laugh about. Situated like the narrative itself between the two worlds pulling on the town of Twin Peaks, the music of the show is eternally with the characters—and the viewers.Series co-creator David Lynch has always displayed a musician’s facility for nimble, suggestive sound arrangements, going back to his first feature film, Eraserhead. But the potency of his soundtracks hit a new level after the director crossed paths with composer Angelo Badalamenti in the 1980s. Badalamenti contributed original compositions to Lynch’s Blue Velvet and played piano during the performance of the titular pop song. For the first season of “Twin Peaks,” he wrote all the music, with Lynch providing lyrics to tunes sung by Julee Cruise.In addition to the two mood-setting triumphs that anchor the first season soundtrack to “Twin Peaks,” Badalamenti also came up with brilliant evocations of the show’s various dramatic modes. The bluesy “Freshly Squeezed” defines the show’s approach to seduction. “Dance of the Dream Man” captures the finger-snapping swing of its surreality. Some of the tracks serve multiple purposes, like “Audrey’s Dance,” which starts out as an accessory to chic sleuthing, then stretches out into a dreamy organ drone punctuated by blasts of saxophone and a lascivious clarinet. In these performances, the composer’s keyboard is frequently the star, though jazz drummer Grady Tate’s rhythms are another consistent highlight. Without his subtle, driving percussion, Badalamenti’s mixture of vintage pop and jazz sonics—at once familiar and plenty strange—might not have come off nearly so well. A great score doesn’t have to play well as an album on its own terms. But this one does. Its tunes are so appealing, Lynch sometimes rips them from their status as commentary on the show’s action and places this music directly into the narrative world. Badalamenti’s pieces show up in jukeboxes that the characters use and in performances by local musicians at the town’s watering holes. When Agent Cooper tries to remember a portion of that crucial dream, he snaps his fingers to the rhythm of the music that originally accompanied the images in his head.If the characters get to listen to the music all the time, why not fans of the show? During the first wave of “Twin Peaks” mania, its opening theme won a Grammy, while the soundtrack album charted on Billboard. The new edition—licensed by Warner Bros. to the boutique Death Waltz label—features a new vinyl remaster by Tal Miller. Compared to the first CD edition of the album, this version gives greater definition to all the parts of a collage-style piece like “The Bookhouse Boys” (which blends in a bit of “Dance of the Dream Man”).Elsewhere, the vinyl remaster is more subtly useful than it is revelatory. Which is as it should be, since this music has never sounded thin or in need of help. The vinyl packaging promises a forthcoming reissue of the soundtrack to the movie—Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me—that followed the show’s cancellation by ABC. Equally needed are new editions of the show’s second-season soundtrack, as well as Julee Cruise’s album Floating Into the Night (which overlaps with the first-season album a bit, and also contains material from the show that didn’t make this set). But since the “Twin Peaks” revival is still in its early stages, ahead of Showtime’s planned third season in 2017, there's still plenty of time to obsess over those recordings, down the road. For now, the first soundtrack's deft combination of romance and menace provides a stunning reminder of everything Lynch and his co-creator Mark Frost dreamed up the first time around.\"],[22288,\"Away is the first Okkervil River album without Okkervil River on it. Will Sheff’s backing band has been a revolving door for a while now, yet even as new faces came and went, they’d always conducted themselves as a real band, especially on the road, where their live shows remained as feverish as ever. But after a tumultuous few years marked by loss and even more lineup changes than usual, Sheff was left questioning whether he even wanted to continue the group. The frontman approached Away like a solo project, writing it on his own and cherry-picking session players to help him record. And as part of that new approach, Sheff turned his back on the frothy rock‘n’roll that had previously driven the band’s finest moments.To start, on Away, Sheff has said that he tried to avoid working with rock musicians. “I’m not as interested in rock‘n’roll as I used to be,” he said. “I don’t really think of this as rock.” And so for Away he went full Astral Weeks, stacking the deck with jazz, folk, and classical musicians, including members of the orchestral ensemble yMusic and Marissa Nadler, who lends harmony vocals throughout. Drummer Cully Symington is the only carryover from the last incarnation of Okkervil River, and from his featherlight, Connie Kay-esque brush work here, you’d never guess he’s the same guy who’s been drumming for Cursive for the last few years.Sheff ratifies his fresh start by symbolically killing off the band on the album opener “Okkervil River R.I.P.” “They had some great songs\\/Must have been a great time so long ago,” he sings on the nearly seven-minute elegy to his past, his creaky voice rising to an early-Dylan sneer as the song is hugged by some familiar Wurlitzer organ. Those woozy organs have been an Okkervil River signature since the very first song of their first record, but here they serve as a callback to something lost, a little more kindling for the funeral pyre.A nearly seven-minute opener could be an album’s flagship statement, but Away is packed with so many songs that approach or pass the seven-minute mark that none carries more weight than any other. A modestly fit listener could run a mile in the time it takes to get through the gentlest number, “Call Yourself Renee,” a soft parade of strings and woodwinds with the hushed quality of Nick Drake. The twinkling “Judey on a Street” is even longer and in less of hurry. Sheff frames it as a lesson about the virtues of patience: “I’m gonna wait for my girl to come,” he sings, “She always takes a little time.” And so do these songs.Away’s unflashy, lyrics-first approach marks a correction from Okkervil River’s production-centric last couple of records, 2011’s prickly I Am Very Far and 2013’s openhearted The Silver Gymnasium. The latter album was pitched on a clever gimmick: Sheff took on the big pop aesthetics of his childhood, tapping the same vein of ’80s nostalgia that made Netflix’s “Stranger Things” such a sleeper hit this summer. It was a play for a wider audience, and a spirited one, but the public didn’t bite. Now, a songwriter who once passed himself off as so indifferent to the spotlight that he made an entire record about it—and then a sequel—fears being shut out. (“I’ve been up and down in my career, and I’ve spent time worrying about it,” Sheff admitted to NPR.) Those anxieties come across on “The Industry,” the closest Away comes to a rock song. “I thought that it was us against the world,” Sheff croons, “but now it’s me against something so big and abstract that I can’t tell what it is.”  Sheff isn’t really interested in sour grapes, though. Instead of griping about an industry that’s no longer working for him, he made a change and tested out a new direction. Away doesn’t aim for the rafters the way Okkervil River did on their best albums, when Sheff was unabashedly playing to the crowd. But there’s a sense that he’s making the record for himself, and an attendant thrill that comes from eavesdropping on that. Away’s scope may be personal, but its takeaways are universal. It’s a touching album about moving on, about the satisfaction of leaving the past behind before it leaves you.\"],[22364,\"If you squint hard enough, a collaboration between RZA and Interpol’s Paul Banks makes a certain kind of sense. There’s a complementary starkness between Interpol’s icicled post-punk and the hip-hop RZA perfected with Wu-Tang Clan. It’s even possible to imagine Banks’ aura of gloom re-sparking some of the wilder, more macabre impulses of RZA’s Gravediggaz days. At their respective peaks, these two might have created a gnarly, gothic spectacle of a rap record together. That’s not the record they made because they aren’t those artists anymore. Rather than carry on as the same shadowy figure of those first two Interpol records, Banks has revealed himself to be a pretty normal guy who likes normal guy things: hip-hop, clubs, and the good life in general. He’s covered J Dilla and released a rap mixtape titled Everybody on My Dick Like They Supposed to Be. RZA, meanwhile, has spent much of the last decade softening his image and broadening his horizons beyond rap. He's starring in a biopic about a porn star Venessa Del Rio and did a track with James Blake. Both artists have proven themselves to be richer, more complex figures than they introduced themselves as—and yet, paradoxically, less interesting figures. Each fought to escape the very box in which they did their best work. Maybe that restlessness is what drew them together. There’s no great story behind their partnership, no unlikely shared acquaintance or serendipitous meet-cute at the backstage of a festival. RZA’s manager suggested the two get together, so they did, and after bonding over noodles and chess they set about recording this extremely workmanlike album as Banks & Steelz (Julian Plenti & Bobby Digital didn’t have the same ring to it, apparently). Banks had been a longtime Wu-Tang fan, of course, while RZA only began to explore Banks’ work after their initial meeting. In an interview with Rolling Stone, he cited not Turn on the Bright Lights or Antics, but rather 2007’s Our Love To Admire as the Interpol album he connected with the most. That’s hardly the consensus pick, but it checks out because it’s the album that mostly closely mirrors the transitional one Wu-Tang put out that year, 8 Diagrams. Both works expanded the group’s templates in ways that, in general, their architects found a lot more rewarding than their fans did. And so with Anything But Words, both jump on the opportunity to branch out. These sort of rocker\\/rapper collaborations tend to be lopsided, with one party, usually the rocker, carrying the work load while the other phones it in (anybody interested in seeing this dynamic in action should watch the strangely fascinating making-of documentary for Linkin Park’s Collision Course, which features more footage of the band in the studio waiting for Jay Z to arrive than it does of Jay Z actually in the studio). To their credit, though, Banks and RZA are each so engaged that their project always feels like a true partnership. Banks’ guitars and synths amicably share space with RZA’s tidy beats, and every track judiciously reserves equal space for both voices.   Run The Jewels, the tag-team duo fueled in equal parts by righteousness and friendship, initially feels like the aspirational model here. On opener “Giant” RZA even channels some of Killer Mike’s bulldozer conviction (“Fuck CNN, this is ghetto editorial!” he fumes.) His rhymes still have a disjointed quality that becomes tedious in large exposures—he rarely carries a thought for more than a few bars—but it’s been years since he’s sounded this fired up. For anybody raised on those first few Wu-Tang records, his unmistakable lispy bark will always elicit a Pavlovian endorphin rush.  Banks, however, couldn't sound more out of place. Instead of singing in the focused baritone on Interpol’s first records, he leans on his higher registers, so much so that he even approaches howling, Adam Levine, “Just like animals, animals, like animals oh” territory. It’s as if he set out to make a rap album for people whose favorite part of Graduation was Chris Martin. And since nearly every song rigidly sticks to the same RZA verse\\/Banks chorus dynamic, all that mewling grows old fast. Anything But Words’ best moments are the ones offer some relief from that endless back and forth. Kool Keith lends his weird energy to “Sword in the Stone,” a satisfying enough bit of fan service for hip-hop heads who have been waiting for a RZA\\/Keith team-up, while Florence and the Machine’s Florence Welch capably channels the spirit of contemporary R&B during her guest turn on “Wild Season.”  There are also decent verses from Ghostface Killah, Method Man and Masta Killa, but those outside voices aren’t enough to break up the often cloying monotony of an hour-long record that tries to repackage two cult artists as a mass-appeal pop act. Banks and RZA spent three years on this record, adding layers upon layers to the tracks and polishing them to an arduous sheen, then releasing it with the full backing of a major label. In interviews, they give off the sense that they’re hoping Banks & Steelz becomes something more permanent than just a one-off dalliance. But at some point during that all that tinkering, and all their efforts to mimic the chorus-centric template of Top 40’s tackiest crossover rap, the record lost whatever scrappy charm it might have held. Anything But Words is the rare side project that might have been better off if both parties had cared a little less.\"],[22380,\"To listen to Deserts of Youth, Liza Victoria’s proper debut album, is to eavesdrop on moments of quiet intensity. Devoid of reverb or overt production effects—a radical choice, in the age of atmospheric GarageBand records—Deserts’ seven songs are comforting yet arresting, effortless while intricate. At times, the Maine-based songwriter’s feathery falsetto is barely audible, a wisp of wind blowing through a deserted street; other times, it’s powerful and clear. Her lyrics, when you can decipher them, feel mostly like conduits for her unusual vocal patterns, less a means of communicating thoughts than establishing setting and mood. Throughout, Victoria seems most keen on satisfying herself; after all, as she sang in an early recording, “I am the friend that I need the most.”In line with her 2014 release, The First Museum, Deserts of Youth begins as a light, psychedelic affair. The jazzy “Century Woods” opens the record with a lilting breeziness. On the ghostly “Another Window,” she counts to four without falling into a steady rhythm, speeding up and slowing down as she recounts observations literal (“Your keys are lying on the floor\\/At the bottom of the bed”) and abstract (“It’s the shadow of the morning… Watch the light breathe where the shadows began”). Although Deserts retains the simple guitar-and-vocal structure of Victoria’s early work, it is a sizeable step forward in songwriting and vision, a haunting, emotional experience that’s most effective as a whole.The album’s scope is captured neatly in its stunning centerpiece, “Lady Day of the Radio.” Although all the songs on Deserts hover around the five-minute mark, “Lady Day” feels especially epic. It boasts Victoria’s most evocative guitar playing yet as she shifts between sad, broken fingerpicking and a stirring climax, the closest she has tread yet to a genuine guitar solo. Situated right in the middle of the album, “Lady Day” is a song so commanding that it seems to dictate the record’s structure; the opening tracks builds up to it, and the closing numbers slowly resolves its cathartic rush.The self-contained world of Deserts of Youth makes the album feel more like a long song cycle than a collection of various pieces—a quality aided by Victoria’s penchant for ending songs abruptly in the middle of lines and writing familiar variations on her melodies. In “Wander,” a stirring ballad that plays like a heartbreaking coda to “Lady Day,” Victoria’s aimless narrator mirrors the music’s meandering quality. “We walk around the old part of town,” she sighs, before reaching one of the album’s most memorable refrains: “I never know where to go with new love.” A moment later, she amends the lyric to address “old love” as well, tying them together into a single entity, removed from time. It’s the record’s purest attempt at a singalong chorus and a lyric that’s emblematic of the album as a whole: a daring new work of strange, intimate beauty that already feels like an old favorite.\"],[22355,\"A few years ago, Jeff Tweedy sang a simple song called “Low Key,” accompanied by his son, on an album he named after his wife and released on his own label. It would be hard to invent a more defining moment for modern-day Wilco. As a frontman, Tweedy’s interests have grown closer to home, his music has become more subtle, and his band has grown more comfortable. They’ve mostly abandoned their past experimental ambitions to focus on sounding smaller, more subdued. It’s telling that their longest and most expansive recent song is a hushed ballad designed to evoke the spirit of a contemplative weekend morning.Schmilco, the band’s 10th album, is similarly low-stakes. Though it was written and recorded during the same sessions that led to last year’s nutty Star Wars, it has more in common with 2014’s Tweedy side project. It’s a largely acoustic affair laden with sweet melodies, autumnal production, and childhood memories that stop just short of nostalgic. The songs on Schmilco are wistful and quaint, zooming in on bittersweet moments with a novelistic eye for detail. In “Normal American Kids,” Tweedy recounts a suburban adolescence spent awkward, angsty, and stoned. In “Cry All Day,” he spills his guts at an open mic. In “Happiness,” he turns to his mother for approval but leaves instead with fresh existential depression, lamenting that \\\\\"happiness depends on who you blame” as the band trudges lazily behind him.With the exception of “Locator”—the only track here that channels Star Wars’ fuzzy, Jim O’Rourke-era flashbacks—Schmilco finds Wilco at their lightest and folksiest. “Cry All Day” hinges on a quiet anxiety – a little bit “Dancing in the Dark,” a little bit “Talent Show.” “Someone to Lose” and “Nope” each harbor a whimsical, bluesy edge; even the chaotic “Common Sense” retains a laid-back groove through guitarist Nels Cline’s glorious, fret-tapping freak-out. Over a decade after Wilco tacked 12 minutes of dialtone noise onto a sparse piano ballad, their idiosyncrasies are now more discreetly embedded into their music—and they still do simple, twangy power-pop better than just about anyone. On another Wilco album, the three-minute gem “If I Ever Was a Child” might fade into the background; here, it’s the sunny peak.Even if Schmilco isn’t Wilco’s most exciting album, it’s among their most consistent and immediately gratifying. In “We Aren’t the World (Safety Girl),” Tweedy swipes the chorus from one of pop music’s most shameless stabs at universality, then subverts it by directing it at one person. This moment hints at the kind of insularity that Wilco now favors; they opt for intimacy over inclusivity, directness over dynamics. Schmilco is another decidedly minor release from a band whose best work (Being There, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) once felt like landmarks– but it succeeds in its subtle, freewheeling self-awareness, as hinted by the punny album title and the Joan Cornellà-penned cover art. An illustrator whose surreal, wordless illustrations often depict characters resolving chaotic situations with strange contentment, Cornellà's work is a perfect fit for present day Wilco: they’ve always been low-key, but they’ve rarely sounded so joyful about it.\"],[22289,\"The pedal steel guitar is a remarkably complex instrument, both a marvel of modern engineering and a stubborn beast. It’s predicated on the idea of a hard cylinder skating up and down the fretboard, and all the tradeoffs required to bend notes and chords around its sleek but unforgiving axis. To allow the notes to glide the way they do, while still letting players modulate chords in the fashion of a conventional guitar, workarounds had to be built into the instrument as it developed over the years: a mind-boggling array of foot pedals and knee levers, plus multiple necks of 10 or even 14 strings each.  But it works, almost miraculously so. All those pulleys and levers come off less like simple machines and more like circuits in a computer; we just hear music pouring forth—a sound like water, like air, like colors loosed from the spectrum and left to run free in unpredictable rivulets. Daniel Lanois’ Goodbye to Language is a celebration of that elegant artifice. Recorded solely using pedal steel, his collaborator Rocco Deluca’s lap steel, and Lanois’ characteristic battery of effects, it highlights the instrument’s mutability—its legato touch, soft attack, long sustain, and tremulous vibrato—and it channels those qualities into free-floating music that flirts with the very dissolution of structure, even as it makes the most of its harmonic relationships.It helps that Lanois has considerable expertise with effects boxes, tricks with tape, and assorted mixing-desk voodoo. He got his start recording Christian a cappella groups in a multi-track studio he pieced together in his mother’s basement in Hamilton, Ontario, and by the early ’70s, he was recording Rick James down there. A decade after that, he helped Brian Eno realize groundbreaking ambient albums like Ambient 4: On Land, Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, and The Pearl, with Harold Budd. Working on albums like U2’s The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree, and Bob Dylan’s Oh Mercy—in which he had Dylan play and sing to the accompaniment of a Roland TR-808 drum machine—he developed a style that balances extreme technique and extreme naturalism until the two create a new kind of truth, a kind of enhanced realism.Lanois has recorded many solo albums before this one, most of them focused on more traditional songwriting. His last, 2014’s Flesh and Machine, flirted with the idea of ambient and experimental music, and one of its songs, “Aquatic,” even introduced the reverberant, free-flowing pedal-steel techniques of Goodbye to Language. But his new album distills that vision to achieve a kind of purity that is rare for any musical process. It sounds like country music that has been dubbed from tape to tape until it has achieved the consistency of spun honey. It’s difficult music to talk about in any detail because the details themselves are so diffuse; no two tracks sound exactly the same but they all blur together, even after dozens of listens, into a blissful kind of ur-music, amniotic and quietly ecstatic. Parsing its mechanics is a little like trying to describe the specific qualities of different kinds of sunlight.That title, Goodbye to Language, speaks directly to the pedal steel’s uncannily expressive qualities. Motifs appear and dissolve again just as quickly. There is just enough dissonance to keep you caught up in its mechanics, and the relationships between chords can be quite counterintuitive and strange, but there is no real discord. As the songs shift from chord to chord, they move with an easy, lilting motion, and the most obviously electronic aspects—the loops, the backmasked bits—disappear faithfully back within the whole, determined never to call attention to themselves. Occasionally, a sense of physicality comes to the fore: squeaks of fingertips against strings, whorls of ribbed wire peeling off in delay. But for the most part, the music gives the illusion of being something sourceless, something created without effort—not product, but pure being; not labor, but freedom. \"],[22290,\"The band names that Michael Collins chooses for his dazed pop projects function as tests of faith. He’s operated under the monikers Run DMT and Salvia Plath, made surreal soul and funk as half of Silk Rhodes, and his latest record comes as Drugdealer. Each choice has been a little goofy and somewhat dumb. But these words are also imbued with the pupil-dilated honesty that comes when you dabble with the sort of mind-expanding substances he’s nodding to. There’s always been more to it than just grinning jokes: the names are bellwethers that let you know if you’ll relate to Collins’ perspective, not indicators of the quality or content of the songs themselves. If people detest the names, Collins said in a 2013 interview, “they probably won’t really like the songs, and that’s just a-ok with me.”Despite the name, Collins is framing this Drugdealer effort as a new beginning. The title—The End of Comedy—can be read as a way of buttoning up the past, moving onward to sweetness and sincerity. But that is, in a sense, what he’s been doing all along. Hidden underneath titles like Bong Voyage, One Hitter Wonders, and Get Ripped or Die Trying is a serious songwriter who’s more in touch with the world around him than his jokes suggest.Now that Collins has a few extra sets of hands around, that’s highlighted even further. Ariel Pink, Weyes Blood’s Natalie Mering, members of Mac DeMarco’s live band, and the Montreal freaks in Sheer Agony all turn up over the course of The End of Comedy’s 11 tracks. They smooth out some of Collins’ stranger—and occasionally, more grating—tendencies. There’s no rambly spoken word pieces about DMT trips or distended drone works. Instead, there’s things like “Suddenly,” a slowly unravelling pop song about joy, newness, and unexpected realizations. The lyrics—sung by Mering—are loose and abstract, but after meandering in the dark a bit, she sees the rise of the morning sun, and with it comes a wave of comfort: “Now I feel like I’m home again.” Even its lyrics are delirious and psychedelic. It’s the sort of song Collins has been writing, or trying to write, over his whole career, but delivered in a much more clear-headed way.That lucidity becomes the defining characteristic of The End of Comedy. There’s a newfound focus that was missing even on Salvia Plath’s The Bardo Story and Silk Rhodes’ self-titled—two relatively hi-fi works by Collins’ standards. Previously, Collins has fogged his more produced recordings with dizzy arrangements, but now he’s able to turn even the lazily strummed acoustics and heavy-lidded slide work of “Easy to Forget” into something purposeful. Ariel Pink, also operating in his surprisingly sincere mode, pens an ode to confusion and amnesia, but Collins breathes life into it, stopping and starting the instrumental in ways that propel what should be a stoned, slippery song.Comedy, in fact, is not necessarily gone. Collins still takes time to use a convoluted metaphor about rolling spliffs during the heatwave plod of “Sea of Nothing.” But what surrounds the peculiar humor is carefully considered in a way that few of his recordings have been. Collins’ work has always had this potential—the untamed electric energy of synapses pushed past their usual operating capacity. Now, with a little help from his friends, he’s finally able to shape and direct it. He’s taken a step back, and instead of aiming for a laugh, a smile will do.\"],[22330,\"Until recently, Irish folk singer and songwriter James Vincent McMorrow only existed in wisps. His delicate falsetto would vanish quickly back into the silence of his sparse arrangements and his ideas were veiled and occasionally incomprehensible, blurred as lyric fragments and extended metaphors. His sophomore album, Post Tropical, was atmospheric in theme and tenor, relying primarily on mood and melody to produce sensations. The beauty was in his exquisite style and sound that buoyed arcane stanzas like, “Someone is ringing a bell\\/It chimes through this shimmering shell\\/That once was my vision of birth\\/But now it’s my vessel and curse.” But McMorrow has hinted at a desire to be bolder and to fully realize his love of hip-hop and electronic music in song. Post Tropical implied these connections existed, but it couldn’t fashion them into a working framework that made meaningful use of the components.The first single from his new album We Move, called “Rising Water,” signaled a complete transformation was in store. The song reimagined McMorrow’s standard indie folk as a pop R&B jam. He kicked up the tempo with heavier drums, creating layers of sound out of electro synths and pulsating bass. It distanced McMorrow from his previously cryptic writing style—which he has charitably called “esoteric”—presenting text that’s easier to follow. His voice was even reintroduced on the track as a powerful and vibrant instrument. But more than anything else, the song seemed to find his perfect balance.“Rising Water” was produced by OVO hitmaker Nineteen85 (the mastermind behind three of Drake’s biggest successes—“Hold On, We’re Going Home,” “Hotline Bling,” and “One Dance”—and one-half of the R&B duo dvsn), who McMorrow met on tour in 2015 and worked closely with for We Move. Nineteen85 brings clarity and sharpness to McMorrow’s work, just as he does Drake’s, by only using the bits that are functional and necessary. Operating alongside OVO’s secret weapon, Frank Dukes (another Toronto beat-maker who has worked with Drake, Travis Scott, Kanye West, Rihanna, and Kendrick Lamar), and Two Inch Punch (who has written and produced songs for Jessie Ware, Sam Smith, and Tory Lanez), have also added more depth and resonance. McMorrow’s music was once picturesque but idle, a prisoner of its own tranquility. His songs were to be admired, but never fully understood, and they didn’t do enough with melody to overcome a static nature and convey more than just “vibes.”The songs on We Move subvert this established pattern. The ideas are articulated much more distinctly than on past recordings, bringing added significance to the gorgeous compositions. McMorrow still communicates most of his feelings through high-pitched coos, but the notes carry more weight and they linger into richer backdrops, like on “Killer Whales” and “Surreal.” The verses are stated plainly and the syllables are more than just conductors for sound. He still leaves some of the mystery, divorcing many narratives from any context, but the writing is much more striking now. “Last Story” is the best song he’s ever written, an epic drama about revisiting old romance that melds the strengths of his two writing styles, remaining ambiguous without feigning intimacy. There are songs about heartbreak and loss; about trying to make it work and moving on; about the many ways lovers can destroy each other, and about personal growth. It isn’t just about conveying a feeling anymore; it’s about examining them. Some songs ruminate on relationships, past and present. Others compile shared experience. He asks rhetorical questions of anyone in earshot: “Are you hopeless like me?” and “Have you come here to save me?” and “Who battled here for you to live?” People saving each other is an ongoing theme, and We Move is fascinated by the impact we make. Every now and then, he’ll say something truly devastating like “I’m afraid to die without leaving a mark.” This album, perhaps, is the greatest reflection of that.We Move is the album McMorrow has always dreamed of making—the one he tried to make with Post Tropical: an elegant, hip hop-indebted record with a folk nucleus that still hangs on every utterance, that advances on his tasteful croons. (McMorrow, a noted fan of rap, has always wanted to transmit that spirit in his tunes but lacked the direction; earlier this year, he said the original version of Early in the Morning had all electronic drums that were created on a Korg Triton—a favorite tool of rap producers like the Neptunes—before he panicked and changed it.) The songs on We Move marry his acoustic ideas with hip-hop\\/R&B sentiment and programming, blending the two into something new and fluid. On “Get Low,” the deep guitar licks settle into a thumping bass line. The chorus of “Ohs” on “Evil” slips into a skipping rhythm of hi-hats and washed-out synths. At every turn, the music is fuller, less caught in suspension. “Is it better to live your life in shallow water or is failure drowning in the deep end?” McMorrow asks on “Lost Angles.” In his case, leaving the safe alternative proved to be the right choice.\"],[22361,\"First presented in 2014, Vetements is among the buzziest new fashion lines. Created by the Margiela and Louis Vuitton-trained designer Demna Gvasalia, the line takes inspiration from the common; its name is even just French for “clothing.” Non-luxury materials often highlight Gvasalia’s runway shows, which take ordinary items and brands and fit them to haute couture with extreme, unnatural silhouettes. Among Gvasalia’s admirers is Kanye West, and with his taste goes the rest of contemporary hip-hop. Long West’s mimic, Travis Scott has performed in the clothing and attended Vetements runway shows with his mentor. He embodies its ethos: take the artificial and common, then distort, re-contextualize, and exaggerate to make it something beautiful.Scott’s second studio album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, is the Houston rapper’s most concise and cohesive project to date. On last year’s Rodeo, Scott struggled to balance ambition, quality, and star power. Songs ran much longer than they needed, letting the vibes simmer until you realized they were trite. Further, his production selection showed little growth from his largely self-produced 2013 debut Owl Pharaoh, and its well-received follow-up mixtape Days Before Rodeo. Both those tapes featured a recognizable “Travis Scott Sound”—an even larger, even more gothic take on Lex Luger’s trap anthems. Rodeo simply amped up the grandeur with little substance or variation.Scott remains committed to his signature sound on Birds but has finally made small tweaks to make it his own. Most Travis Scott songs sound very serious, and Birds finds him at his most melodramatic. Even the peak ridiculous moments on Birds are delivered with a completely straight face. On “through the late night,” he utters, “Relieve my heart of malice,” but offers no reason why that may be necessary. Because he does not provide great detail or context as to why he’s in dire need of salvation, it comes off as both grandiose and vacuous, which, at best, is just really fun to listen to. His apocalyptic vanity is less high art than it is camp, but his commitment is similar to Lana Del Rey’s high-stakes ennui ballads on Ultraviolence, or all of the soapy affairs across David Lynch’s “Twin Peaks.”The use of synthetic sound curios across Birds also help define this world, this pre-fab movie studio lot where Scott’s antics start to make more sense. The production across Birds’ 14 tracks is as big and important as any across Scott’s discography, but every outsourced producer here creates something bespoke to Scott’s developing aesthetic, with at least one alien soundbite making an otherwise conventional beat something special. “sweet sweet,” for example, opens with a glossy noise recalling mid-2000s AIM sound effects and the standout “pick up the phone” features a hollowed-out synth that sounds like it’s been digitized 10 times over. The latter culminates with that effect turned into a beautiful glissando that cuts off abruptly. Better to do more with less than try to pack as many flourishes as possible onto one track. The two main criticisms that have followed Scott his entire career are that he doesn’t rap about anything, and when he does rap, he doesn’t do it well. It’s easy to tell when Travis Scott is “trying to rap,” as on album opener “the ends,” because he really turns down the Auto-Tune. And when given too much time on the mic, Scott reverts to bad hashtag rapper. But when the verses are short, he offers, at the very least, intriguing bits of imagery: spending “a Sunday morning in a brothel,” or lacking cell “service in the mountains.” The scenes never materialize into anything, but they help decorate an album and keep the artificial stakes high and the energy up. It’s also telling that each major guest highlights a key component that Scott lacks. André 3000, delivering a new trap flow, paints a vivid picture on “the ends.” Kendrick Lamar puts on a technical clinic, annunciating and shifting pitches on “goosebumps.” 21 Savage is plainspoken, straightforward, and fierce on “outside.” On “pick up the phone,” Quavo even delivers the titular “Birds in the Trap Sing Brian McKnight.” Despite even more vocal contributions from the Weeknd, Young Thug, Cassie, Kid Cudi, Swizz Beatz, Bryson Tiller, and others, Travis Scott remains at the center because he’s finally found his calling. He’s no longer a biter or an up-and-coming protege or an industry plant. He’s the rich and often ineffectual host of the party, overlooking the grounds from his dubious veranda, here to make sure everyone comes in and goes out looking and sounding spectacular. He has always been a mood-setter and a vocalist, and he is in full command of the vibe, tone, and mood of this entire project more than ever. It’s a triumph that Travis Scott sources from different parts to turn Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight into his unified vision. The cover art (shot by Nick Knight) shows Scott as something between a bird, a fallen angel, and a video game character—his eyes pure white with plumes of equally white smoke rising above. It’s a ridiculous image to cover an album that includes a song called “beibs in the trap”—a misspelling of Justin Bieber as slang for cocaine—but that’s the point. Travis Scott repurposes conventional subjects and sounds, making them compelling with his panache. Like his mentor, he seems keenly aware of his place in the genre. At one point, he literally says, “Shout my tropes!” By and large, the whole record is about rampant drug abuse, yet he transcends the rote topic with how forcefully and pompously he indulges. Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight escapes as Travis Scott’s best work yet: a combination of elevated significance, self-awareness, and the old trick of spinning something so plain into something so luxurious. \"],[22284,\"Katie and Allison Crutchfield, the 27-year-old twin sisters now known for fronting the bands Waxahatchee and Swearin’, respectively, began playing music in their early teens, Katie picking up guitar, Allison, drums. They would come home from school in their hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, grab a snack, and head down to the basement to practice until their family told them it was too late. By the age of 15, the Crutchfields had formed their first band, the Ackleys, a twangy rock four-piece that gained a small local following. In a 2006 documentary-style short about the band, the Ackleys discuss the future of their two-year-old project, which was soon to be challenged by the departure of one member for college. “I see it going on forever, of course,” says a 17-year-old Allison, optimism radiating through her thick Southern accent. But though the factors that break up many friends after high school graduation would indeed extinguish the Ackleys, the Crutchfields were clearly meant for greater opportunities. P.S. Eliot, the band they formed together after the dissolution of their first group, has been lovingly documented with 2007-2011, a 2xCD set that gathers the group’s two albums and an EP, along with assorted demos and home recordings.P.S. Eliot was directly informed by the Crutchfields’ desire to experience life outside of Birmingham. Then 18 years old, the twins found that they had very little in common with their hometown scene, which, according to an oral history by Pitchfork contributor Liz Pelly included in the box, was largely composed of hardcore bros moshing to music made by men without any awareness of the space they were occupying. Thanks to the Ackleys’ limited but informative tour experience, Allison and Katie discovered that musical spaces don’t have to be hyper-masculine or oppressive. P.S. Eliot was an opportunity to work against sexist social structures from within through the simple strategy of offering an empowering alternative.Early on, Katie and Allison cited stalwarts like Guided by Voices, Fugazi, and the Velvet Underground as influences. Robert Pollard’s prolificacy inspired Katie, leading her to think that she too had to write many songs, good and bad, in order to find the gems. Though in sound they were more pop-punk than riot grrrl, P.S. Eliot was indebted to the sensibilities of acts like Bikini Kill or Sleater-Kinney, whose words offered anthems for those expected to sit on the sidelines, who paved a path simply by existing, who created music as a means to survive. P.S. Eliot’s first recording, the 2008 Bike Wreck demo, sounds decidedly harsh and lo-fi, being recorded in the Crutchfield family garage on a digital 8-track and Macbook, but there’s obvious potential in the five-song experiment, even if it is buried beneath some serious static fuzz. It wasn’t until 2009, with two small P.S. Eliot tours down and after the Crutchfield twins had settled in nearby Tuscaloosa, that they hit their stride. Recorded over two days in their living room, Introverted Romance in Our Troubled Minds sounds considerably cleaner than the Bike Wreck demo, and for the first time, P.S. Eliot sound like a fully-formed project, existing somewhere between scrappily precise and gracefully shambolic. Now joined by Will Granger on guitar and (briefly) Michael McClellan of the Ackleys on bass, the Crutchfields could focus on a sort of controlled chaos. Unlike the carefully constructed expression of vulnerability she currently owns as Waxahatchee, Katie’s songwriting with P.S. Eliot exploded in a wild rush. She stacks adjectives with abandon, as words tumble over each other in a race to stay afloat above the churning riffs (see “Augustus”’s 20 seconds outpouring “the subsequent or the demise\\/to praise or to antagonize, it all sounds the same\\/the arrogant teenage prestige\\/seems like such a distinctive breed\\/disheveled fame taking steady aim\\/on cerebral wealth, or my own personal hell”). While her stream-of-consciousness style could seem like an attempt at obfuscation, Katie’s lyrics are so deeply rooted in the personal that their excess manages to convey a sincere (and perhaps naive) hunger to experience the highs and lows of life. The slow-burning “Tennessee,” for example, is about being tugged in different directions by desires: “I’ve got a racing mind and enough gas to get to Tennessee\\/Baby, let’s push our limits\\/I got a West Coast heart and an East Coast mentality.” She explores emotional division through anecdotes about a three-year romantic cycle with a partner. On “Incoherent Love Songs,” this takes the form of an unhealthy mutual dependency that is later elaborated as a blind reliance on “memories of content” in “Tangible Romance.” P.S. Eliot’s self-critical admission of uncertainty, bad habits, and the inability to escape recalls the early work of Rilo Kiley, whose singer Jenny Lewis offered assurance that it is okay to feel.By the time Introverted Romance in Our Troubled Minds was released by Detroit label Salinas in 2009, P.S. Eliot were regularly touring north to Brooklyn and had a growing and devoted fanbase. Their next release, 2010’s five-song Living in Squalor EP shows remarkable growth from the Bike Wreck demo. While both share a similar unrestrained energy, Squalor is cohesive. A telling example is an updated version of Bike Wreck’s “Broken Record”; what was once an (ironically) indecipherable song about the struggle to communicate now came through loud and clear.Sadie, P.S. Eliot’s final album, was recorded in Birmingham in late 2010. If Introverted found P.S. Eliot processing the world around them, Sadie was an epiphany, a discovery after a whole lot of digging. The emotional ties that bound Katie’s lyrics were dissolving and there is a distinct sense of freedom and confidence. But rather than displaying a pop-punk need to spit everything out immediately, P.S. Eliot instead turns towards slowly, patiently, painting a clear picture. Sadie is more of a moodboard than a list of concerns and complexes like Introverted. Even though P.S. Eliot had not played many of the songs on Sadie as a full band before, they come off as tight and prepared thanks to the production work of New Jersey’s Mark Bronzino. A song like the five-minute “Diana” is a world away from Introverted. It finds a melancholic Katie singing barely above a whisper, but a majority of the track is just a guitar. By their end, P.S. Eliot had reached a state of cohesion many bands never do. Yet by September 2011, the band decided to quit while they were ahead.Creatively, Katie and Allison were both ready to pursue new projects; there was a distinct feeling that P.S. Eliot had fulfilled its intentions. Shortly after recording Sadie, Katie wrote the first Waxahatchee release, American Weekend, on the same 8-track used to record the Bike Wreck demo. Katie and Allison started a band called Bad Banana, which lasted from 2010-2011. Allison would later go on to start Swearin’ along with a solo act and Katie would commit to Waxahatchee full-time. P.S. Eliot were, for better or worse, a true DIY band, starting and ending equally suddenly. On the plus side, they existed on their own terms, refused on compromise, and developed their own personal politics. On the negative side, they would cancel shows on a whim and fight amongst themselves to the point of once abandoning first bassist Reena Upadhyay in Grand Rapids.As DIY artists, the Crutchfields possessed agency that has helped determine how they now carry themselves as solo artists. P.S. Eliot wasn’t created to please anyone. It didn’t satisfy Ackleys fans who were just confused by the scuzzy and distinctly feminist project. Its publicity was minimal at best. P.S. Eliot existed for its members. “I feel like the things I wanted were so pure,” reflects Allison in the oral history of the band that accompanies the release. “To just write music, and for people to hear it, and to go on tour, and to hang out with our friends.” Today, in 2016, knowing what would come after the end of P.S. Eliot, it is particularly funny to think about one lyric Katie sings on Introverted’s “Tennessee”: “Because we’ll go to sleep when we’re dead\\/And I’ll quit when I’m 25.” They had no idea what the future held.\"],[22354,\"Carly Rae Jepsen doesn’t sing love songs, exactly. A friend pointed out that Carly lives in the intervals—when love is just out of frame, acting as a gravitational force. Her songs are preludes and codas. “First Time,” the opening track of E•MO•TION Side B—a collection of outtakes released a year after last year’s E•MO•TION—is a coda and prelude at the same time. It begins as a cassette-recording of its own chorus, a distorted and decayed memory of itself, which is then rewound to the start of its verse before it drops in with a sudden, severe clarity. The song is about a messy breakup that she tries to guide back to the more intelligible beginnings of a relationship. She sings, “When my heart breaks it always feels like the first time,” and, “Through all the heartbreak we’ll make it feel like the first time.” This is how time works in Jepsen’s songs. Every emotion contains all previous instances of its feeling and is experienced as a collapsed whole. The songs on E•MO•TION Side B are pop songs, gorgeous and direct, but they are also extremely recursive spaces, blushing compressions of time, small infinities of heartbreak.These songs, sometimes more so than the album for which they were recorded, fold in synthetic textures from ’80s pop and give them a modern finish, producing music that feels incongruent with both of its intended time periods. The songs can derive meaning and power from their associative design; in “Higher,” for instance, synths provide both the song’s texture and rhythm, and guitars glimmer as if they were stars embedded in the track; it produces the crisp, fussed architecture of a Scritti Politti song and fills it with new feelings. It’s the most transparent “love” song released from Jepsen’s sessions for E•MO•TION (for which apparently 250 songs were written) in that it takes place in the context of an actual relationship. Elsewhere she is repelled or attracted by love, either by its presence or absence. “We should know better, this can’t last forever\\/Kiss me one more time,” she sings in “The One,” a song in which she actively resists the boundaries of a relationship but still finds herself slipping into its pull. There’s a shyness to the beat of “The One,” a kind of internal swerve as if it’s resisting the same designations and definitions as Jepsen. Form and function also align in “Cry,” a song animated by a synth bass that’s just muted enough to invert its usual effect, generating a feeling of weightlessness. Jepsen uses this environment to describe the cruel asymmetry of being in a relationship with someone who’s emotionally unavailable.The songs on E•MO•TION Side B feel decidedly more like a continuation of E•MO•TION itself. Still, a few are included to reveal a more disordered process, a sense that Jepsen was working through as many forms and ideas as possible until she found the aesthetic for E•MO•TION. “Body Language,” co-written with Dev Hynes, builds to a chorus that feels like an unremarkable subplot of the verse. “Store” is fascinating, in that it sounds like different songs written at different times had inorganically fused together. The verse is carefully sung, a dream sequence from which the chorus is a violent waking. “I’m just going to the store,” Jepsen sings over synths that resemble individual belches of a saxophone, “You might not see me anymore.” Its greatest appeal lies perhaps in the conceit of the lyric, that Jepsen might casually break up with someone by walking to a nearby deli and dematerializing.2015’s E•MO•TION has the design of a big pop record, but it found more critical success than commercial. “With pop I think the hidden article of faith is that music can take over public space, stamp itself on a moment,” Pitchfork contributor Tom Ewing wrote in 2011. “If a pop single can't do this, then what is it?” Like most pop music that’s only “pop” in an idiomatic sense, it tends to function as an unintended secret. Jepsen released E•MO•TION Side B in this spirit, a gift to the fiercely devoted if niche fanbase she’s amassed since the release of E•MO•TION. That the songs can sound enormous while maintaining this kind of person-to-person intimacy is Jepsen’s particular talent. On “Fever,” in the weird and unstable space just before a breakup, Jepsen describes stealing her boyfriend’s bicycle and then riding it back to his house, only to discover he’s not home. His absence causes a near silence in the song, where Jepsen's musical and emotional environment are vacuumed into the throb of a bass drum, a kind of vertigo and panic encoded in sound. “You want to break my heart\\/All right,” she sings, “I caught your fever\\/I’ll be feeling it forever.” In this fluctuating reality, the synths she sings over have a glow that’s both alien and familiar, like objects under a blacklight. It feels like the feeling.\"],[22351,\"On their 2013 debut no world, the L.A. duo inc. no world (formerly inc., also formerly Teen Inc.) were more comfortable in the shadows than in the light. Directors of mood first and foremost, brothers Andrew and Daniel Aged crafted a consistent set of earnest if at times anonymous blue-eyed R&B. no world was the product of two studio rats who had spent years honing their craft, reverent to plush ’80s R&B but with a foot in the ’00s. Their vibes-above-all approach played to their strengths: They were not deconstructionists but faithful recreators and Andrew’s gentle vocals were treated more like a texture blended into the mood.As Light As Light, their first album in three years, plays it straighter. Andrew’s voice is pushed closer to the front of the mix and the production carves out a deeper pocket for his vocals. Whereas no world featured repeated mantras that unfurled at their own pace, As Light As Light places an emphasis on more traditional verse-chorus-verse songwriting. On “The Wheel,” everything revolves around and builds up to its chorus, where all the heft comes from Andrew’s vocals, injected here with a heat previously only hinted at. When he latches onto a chorus that’s got legs (“Waters of You”), the brothers instinctively milk it for all its worth. But moving away from the chant-like repetition that worked so well on no world exposes some pedestrian songwriting: Andrew fails to breathe life into the love-as-water metaphor on “Without Water,” and when the Ageds don’t peel back the layers, Andrew’s verses tend to get lost in the shuffle (“In Your Beauty”), a song that should have taken off at least one if not two accessories before leaving the house.Andrew’s devotionals, given extra weight now that he demonstrates his range as a vocalist, are forever in a state of adoration. “I have fears, I have fallen, and I’ve lost my way back home\\/But I’ve never had to wonder about the love you’ve shown,” he sings about a long-time lover on “Without Water.” These are songs of connection, not conquest; they celebrate emotional support, not emotional drain. “We’ll stay up laughing [about] what we thought was true,” he imagines on “In This Dream,” a late-album slow-burner with a hollowed-out warmth. Andrew sings with a generous optimism that feels hard-earned, the kind that emerges after a realization that all other approaches hold intimacy at arm’s length.Near the end, its songs become sparse and less adorned—even rootsier. There’s an honest-to-god slide guitar on “In Love,” which shimmers with a lightness characteristic of inc. no world’s former sound but with a stronger focus on songcraft. Much like the rest of As Light As Light, even though the song contains fewer elements, the production feels thicker and less prone to being carried off by the slightest breeze. What remains, however, is an overriding sense of anonymity that blunts the impact of Andrew’s sentiments. While Andrew has a knack for sticky hooks, his vocals rely on nuance more than natural charm—in a crowd of whispery R&B vocalists, he just doesn’t have the range to stick out. But his ability to spin on the same line and draw out different meanings works for inc. no world, who are smart to cast off some of their ambient textures in favor of something more elemental. They remain immaculate R&B players who understand the pleasure of patience and the power of delicacy. \"],[22363,\"Chattanooga MC Isaiah Rashad wears his anxieties. They bleed through the rap revelry in verse, as if they could consume him at any moment. Is he about to stunt, or is he about to self-destruct? It makes his songs more like inkblots in a Rorschach test: What you see in them may depend on where you currently are on the spectrum—longing, laboring, or lost. Rashad appeared fully-formed on his debut Cilvia Demo as a young rap star in the making constantly humanizing himself before eyewitnesses with bars like “I done grown up for my child’s sake.” It was clear early on that he wasn’t afraid to publicly grapple with his demons. “Now, I’m praying that I make it to 25\\/They be calling doctors for my health\\/And ‘no’ is kinda hard to say to drugs\\/’Cause I been having problems with myself,” Rashad rapped on “Heavenly Father.” He turned 25 this year, but it was a rocky road getting here. In the two quiet years since Isaiah Rashad released Cilvia, his inactivity fed his addiction, and vice versa. During a stint on Schoolboy Q’s Oxymoron tour in 2014, he got hooked on a potent brew of Xanax and alcohol, a concoction used to numb himself during an ongoing battle with depression. Drug dependency threatened to derail a promising career and almost getting him dropped from Top Dawg Entertainment on a handful of occasions. “I can’t admit, I’ve been depressed\\/I hit a wall, ouch,” he raps on “Dressed Like Rappers” from his long-awaited follow-up, The Sun’s Tirade. It’s an album that examines the strain of family ties, smalltown spokesmanship, and self-awareness. The Sun’s Tirade is brutally honest and open, a record saddled by substance abuse and melancholia. These are soul-baring cuts lined with pent-up emotions from the tour, which “BDay” hints at in a single lyric: “How do you tell the truth to a crowd of white people?”Fittingly, though, Rashad really finds his voice on The Sun’s Tirade, an album filled with the tensions caused by a cycle of self-loathing and self-discovery. The tension is usually built up in his cadences with his uncanny sense for when to give and when to pull back. His voice can deflate in an instant or shrink to a mumble or mushroom into singsong. Raps tumble, sputter, and croak, stretching his timbre’s range and depth. On “Tity and Dolla,” he tries on a slippery inflection that’s whiny and exaggerated, which later morphs into something snappier at the octave change. His voice nearly cracks on “Park” as he staggers through verse rapping quick hitters like “I’m tryna be Nicki Minaj\\/Rich as a bitch in the drop” and “Bitch have you tutored the pastor\\/I know the root and the master\\/I know the coupe was a casket.” “Rope \\/\\/ rosegold” showcases flows on opposite ends of the spectrum, the first an impassioned croon, the second something more intoned, canceling out the animated performance. On every line, he works toward lucidity.The Sun’s Tirade remains heavy with sound and subject. Rashad often reveals his deepest misgivings and uncertainties and scales his woes with liquid courage, intoxicated and numb. But instead of a disorienting album that tries to replicate those druggy highs and lows, the songs are clear-eyed, sobering, and even more detail-oriented than Cilvia Demo with monster guest verses from TDE associates Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock and complementary ones from other contributors (SZA and Kari Faux, among others). There is even more precision and purpose in the raps here and an even stronger sense of identity. Take a standout like “Free Lunch,” which shows off his impeccable rhythm and timing, wading through a groovy tune tied together by a personal anecdote: The only numbers Rashad remembered as a kid were the last digits of his social security number, which was his access code for the free lunch program. Rashad connects the past and present together in an effort to understand his future.The sonic template of The Sun’s Tirade is laid bare on “Brenda”: “Mix that Boosie with that boom bap.” There’s a similar palette to Cilvia Demo—as indebted to J Dilla production kits and Common’s Electric Circus as it is to Lil Wayne and Scarface—but this is far more adventurous on the back half. There’s a robotic Mike WiLL Made-It beat (“A Lot”), “Stuck in the Mud” splits itself in two with varying moods and textures, and the double-time “Don’t Matter” is the most uptempo thing he’s ever rapped on. These added dimensions bring variety to an otherwise uniform soundscape. Rashad has a way of making styles his own, shaving influences down until they bear his signature while paying homage along the way. “Silkk Da Shocka,” which carries on Rashad’s legacy of songs named after Southern rappers (there’s also the smooth 2 Chainz salute on “Tity and Dolla”), is a spiritual successor to “West Savannah” in aim and sound, moving in tandem with the Internet’s Syd over a slow-rolling, bluesy riff. The songs create a similar aesthetic blend to Cilvia Demo, processing regional rap staples through a soul filter.But The Sun’s Tirade isn’t just Cilvia Demo: Redux. It’s a complex portrait of a man in transition. The album is an evolution for an artist who still may have his best in store. Development and maturation are themes unfolding in both Isaiah Rashad’s lyrics and personal life, and that overlap produced one of the great rehab records in recent memory, a collection of songs that both diagnose and medicate. “Can I sleep for a while? Can I work on myself?” Rashad asks on “Stuck in the Mud.” Wallowing in isolation and self-pity nearly drove one of rap’s most promising talents to implode. The Sun’s Tirade is a moving triumph to facing your demons and coming out on the other side one step closer to whole.\"],[22281,\"Matthew Cooper is one of our definitive contemporary pop-ambient artists, and he never goes too long without issuing Eluvium music in some fashion. He tends to release an LP about every three years, as though his creativity runs on the same long natural cycles that inform his songs. Though his albums blend into a timeless stasis in memory, going back over his discography—without even getting into collaborations with the likes of Explosions in the Sky’s Mark T. Smith—reveals a process of deliberate change, and then assimilating the changes back into the whole.Cooper began by coaxing drones from guitars in the manner of Stars of the Lid and playing misty-eyed piano études. He then came into his own on 2007’s polyglot Copia, where added strings and winds glowed from within. The 2010 Similes LP made room for (and was diluted by) Cooper’s wan vocals. But he corrected course on 2013’s Nightmare Ending, where he fell silent again, ginning up dark clouds of distortion for a dense, nocturnal experience.False Readings On is a logical follow-up, marshaling Eluvium’s arsenal into sweeping maximalist splendor. And perhaps it’s that sense of a logical conclusion that makes it sometimes feel more impressive than genuinely transporting. To be sure, Cooper is operating with persuasive confidence. With hardly a shadow to be found, the music is bright, loud, and physical. The stated theme is “cognitive dissonance in modern society.” One often scoffs at ambient artists who put too fine a point on the heady themes of their sparse chord changes, but you can actually hear how the concept structures the compositions, as drastically different speeds and timbres play against one another, unleashing turbulent energies.That’s clearest in “Fugue State,” where nervy tootles that sound ripped from the madder regions of Philip Glass’ Music in Twelve Parts are held in check by a grand, slow harmonic apparatus. The funnels of distortion from Nightmare Ending are back, all but blotting out the inner dynamics of “Washer Logistics.” There are glorious organ chords, like the wind-beaten surface of sun-slicked water. Screaming quasi-operatic vocals telegraph some afterlife feeling beyond pleasure and distress; they do the orchestral heavy-lifting. Lustrous acoustic guitar strums and pianos glint here and there. And it’s all pillowed in the softest harmonies, shot through with the long revolutions of simple intervals in the bass or a recessive synth tone.Each track is either very short or very long. The long ones build and break with magisterial resolve, sometimes to a fault: “Beyond the Moon for Someone in Reverse” and “Rorschach Pavan,” though very different in tone, have almost identical arcs. The album’s thick relentlessness flatters the soft space of “Movie Night Revisited,” where acoustic swells evoke Arvo Pärt by way of the Caretaker—sacred music gone benignly mad. The Messiaen-like wind line that enters in the middle is a welcome surprise on an album where tracks are more likely to gather and repeat without changing direction. It’s a reminder of the more reticent Eluvium of Copia, still his best album. For the most part, those elegant, eloquent miniatures are gone. Instead, we must be drenched in distortion, buffeted by mezzo-soprano gales, swallowed by keyboard chords, drowned in drones. The effect is certainly striking. Album closer “Posturing Through Metaphysical Collapse” accounts for a quarter of the album’s length, and luckily, it’s a keeper, drawing all the album’s motifs into a climactic tour de force. And yet the sense persists that the more Eluvium piles on, the less unique he sounds. False Readings On is awesome while it’s playing, and when it stops, it’s gone. But the small, chiming whorls of “Radio Ballet,” you won't soon forget.\"],[22342,\"Pianist Chick Corea and saxophonist Anthony Braxton were not destined to be creative partners for long. But the year these virtuosos spent in the free-jazz supergroup Circle proved to be a notable one. By 1970, Corea was a master of high-energy, abstract playing, thanks to his tenure in a particularly wild edition of Miles Davis’ group. And Braxton’s work alongside fellow Chicagoans like Wadada Leo Smith had already put a charge into progressive improvisers on multiple continents—though Braxton was also down in the mouth over the long odds he faced in getting his ambitious classical pieces heard in New York and Paris. On the night he met Corea, Braxton considered himself more of a chess-game hustler than a working musician. The origin story goes that Braxton was prodded into a one-off gig by some longtime associates. After the concert, drummer Jack DeJohnette led the crew over to the Village Vanguard, where Corea was playing in a trio with drummer Barry Altschul and bassist Dave Holland (another Davis veteran, as was DeJohnette). Braxton sat in with Corea’s group, and when the night came to an end, the pianist gave Braxton his address and asked him over to jam. Six months later, CBS Records was taping a show by Corea, Braxton, Holland, and Altschul—a quartet going by the name Circle.Circle 1: Live in Germany Concert was originally issued in 1971, along with the final studio session the group produced before busting up (Circle 2: Gathering). CD reissues of both albums came out through Corea’s Stretch imprint in the ’90s, before falling out of print. Now both records have been introduced to the digital catalogue. As none of Circle’s other studio sessions and live recordings are available on streaming services, these reissues would be welcome even if they were of middling quality. Luckily, each one comes across as a worthy addition to this short-lived band’s discography.Germany shares a setlist with the latter half of Circle’s other famous live album—though at this gig, the band pushes prettiness and aggression to greater extremes. A long suite of two compositions by Holland opens the record. Corea gives “Toy Room” a haunted solo introduction that keeps the childhood nostalgia of the main theme from seeming too innocent when it arrives. With the rhythm section offering free-time support, Corea’s long feature only gives brief glimpses of the prickly side of his playing. Braxton’s entrance on flute has a similarly lyrical quality, even when his lines create strange harmonies. Corea occasionally follows Braxton into freer vistas before pulling the saxophonist back to the underlying tune. Despite the fact that the song never gets that far “out,” there’s a compelling drama to the way the players negotiate this loveliness.After an improvised, transitional section in the suite, another Holland tune follows. (In keeping with a typo from the original pressing, the song “Q & A” is once again spelled “O & A” on this reissue.) Given its jabbing, repetitive hook, this composition was well suited to demonstrations of Circle’s collective power. But this take from Germany sounds particularly energetic. From the outset of his first soprano solo, Braxton is heard mixing all the paints from his “language music” palette—with harsh overblowing quickly giving way to longer-held tones, then wide-interval attacks.In addition to the timbral intensity of the performance, the quick juggling of such different sound styles has its own hardcore feel. And when the band relents, they keep the experimental vibe afloat by rustling around with miscellaneous percussion instruments and whistles. Later on, Corea flashes some powerful cluster-chords (which owe a debt to Cecil Taylor), and then Braxton helps thrash through Holland’s theme again, this time on alto. He stays on that instrument for the band’s frequent concert closer, the standard “There Is No Greater Love.” It has a buoyant strut—at least until the band bashes its form to pieces.Though each show could prove distinct, Circle’s setlists never seemed to alter greatly. By contrast, their output in studio sessions could result in unstructured group improv, as well as tight duos, trios, and full-quartet workouts. The only studio album released near-contemporaneously with the group’s existence was Circle 2: Gathering. After Corea found a large public with his rock-influenced Return to Forever ensemble, Blue Note records hurried out archival collections of Circle’s first studio rehearsals with Circulus and Circling In. But while those vault-clearing sets are interesting, they don’t cast the same spell that Gathering does.The album is one long track, credited to Corea’s compositional pen. But the openness of the performance—and its simultaneous balance—is an achievement that only a well-drilled group can deliver. The poetic understanding between Braxton and Holland is announced early on when the string player (on cello) offers gorgeous bowed lines behind the soprano saxophonist’s soulful phrases. Corea’s opening melodic material is similarly attractive, and he provides well-timed transitions and smart support to other band members throughout. Circle’s two biggest personalities may have both been impatient to explore their new ideas. For Corea, that meant a hard turn away from the free-jazz fringe, and an embrace of both Scientology as well as what he called the more “communicative” sound of his subsequent rock-fusion style. Braxton had electronic music, big-band albums, and multi-orchestra concepts knocking around in his head. But on Gathering, they still had the patience necessary to make a collaborative group work at a high level.\"],[22352,\"Stephen Wilkinson knows a good thing when he hears it. The English multi-instrumentalist and electronic producer’s albums as Bibio usually draw on an acuity for curation rather than composition. He collects fine-grained sounds and moods from lightly dusted corners of music and mounts them in blurry exhibits with bespoke cultural histories. On his new EP, he curates himself, correctly identifying and expanding on the best thing about his last record.  The ’80s R&B homage “Why So Serious?” stood out on the day-glo pop pastiche A Mineral Love because of a charming guest spot by Olivier St. Louis (née Daysoul), a UK vocalist who previously appeared on tracks by Hudson Mohawke and Onra. Bibio’s settings are often distorted, as though smeared in memory, but this one was unusually period-perfect, with a guitar picking out spiky cursive in a breathy mix of synths and percussion, and a vocal line masking sex with tender concepts like devotion. It was a markedly simple look for a producer prone to bouts of electronic psychedelia. On The Serious EP, Bibio and St. Louis concoct three new songs in the same style, and though not one is as effortlessly head-turning as the original, a pleasant froth is sustained throughout. The most striking is “Stress Me Out,” where a parched funk crunch elicits a restive performance from St. Louis, whose effects rely more on timing and inflection than natural timbre. The quieter storms of “Make Up” and “Night Falls”—an abandoned vocal from A Mineral Love with new custom-built music—are much flatter, briefly descending and dispersing with little development. They miss the loose, casual strut of their source, and the faint but pervasive remove typical of Bibio starts to creep in.According to Wilkinson, he and St. Louis hung out at his country cottage but then made the EP over email, which may account for the lack of spontaneous interaction detectable in the tracks. Though the retro R&B style is timely, Bibio and St. Louis don’t modify it with hovering menace, like the Weeknd; or a political charge, like Blood Orange; or restrained anger, like Frank Ocean. Like the canned effervescence of the music, the emotions seem patched in from another time, neutralized by distance.St. Louis’ lyrics here are more general than personal, let alone idiosyncratic. “Make Up” is dominated by bromides about how you’ve got to try to succeed, and so on. “Stress Me Out” is about what it feels like to be stressed out. It’s unabashedly light, limited, occasional fare. But it’s also a needed freshening up of an increasingly opaque discography. The title track is a keeper, and the prospect of Bibio providing his colorful instrumentals to other singers—albeit in a more thorough, ambitious, altogether more serious way—is an intriguing one.\"],[22322,\"The lead single to Zomby’s first album in more than three years was not terribly auspicious. Sure, in the run-up to its release, the prospect sounded almost too good to be true: Zomby and Burial together at last—bass music’s two most notoriously hermetic producers emerging from their studio lairs bearing, one could only assume, fistfuls of charcoal and lightning. But their collaboration “Sweetz” sounded half-assed: desultory in spirit, scattered in form, and overlaid with an insistent vocal loop insisting, “Get me fucked up\\/Get me fucked up\\/Get me fucked up,” over and over, like the inner monologue of a user whose serotonin receptors have long since scabbed over. Heard on its own, it didn't sound like much. But “Sweetz” turns out to make a strange kind of sense in the context of the album. Its weird twists and turns draw you in; its lysergic extremes fuck you up. In its dead-eyed way, it comes alive.Zomby has never played to expectations. From his early, squirrelly dubstep singles and the full-bore breakbeat hardcore of his debut album, 2008’s Where Were U in ’92?—an album that helped set up a broad wave of British rave revivalism from artists like Lone, Special Request, and even Jamie xx—he veered into unexpectedly sentimental territory with 2011’s expansive Dedication, his first album for 4AD. It was a promising turn of affairs, the famously cagey artist finally wearing his heart on his Balmain sleeve. But 2013’s With Love tested even his most stalwart fans’ patience. Its grim mood hung like a pall, and many of its 33 tracks felt like unfinished sketches; some of them, like “Digital Smoke” and “Entropy Sketch,” were merely variants of each other, separated by inelegant fadeouts.But Ultra is the most self-assured Zomby record in ages, and a huge step forward from the slightly pro-forma DJ tools of last year’s Let's Jam!! EPs. Even at its darkest—which is to say, most of it—he sounds like he’s enjoying himself, from the triumphant fanfare of the opening “Reflection” to the regal tones of the closing “Thaw.” Sometimes, he’s in and out in two minutes, just to see what kind of sparks fly when one sound rubs up against another. Elsewhere, he lets loops tumble on as long as he likes. That strategy doesn’t always work: the cycling synths and voices of “Fly 2” abruptly drop in tempo some two-and-a-half minutes into the tune and then continue spinning away for three more minutes, slow and stuporous, like a battery-operated toy running low on charge. “Her,” on the other hand, is perfect—just a four-bar chord progression made of bright, gleaming synths and booming, Phil Collins-grade toms. It’s so hopeful it makes you a little nervous, because nothing in life works out as well as the utopia it promises.Ultra is also Zomby’s most experimental record in ages. That might sound strange, given how many of his usual tropes come into play: video-game bleeps, laser blasts, gun-cock samples, and all the other accouterments of grime. But, particularly after the polished sonics of With Love, he’s letting himself get weird again. “Burst” may employ the same arcade chirps that he’s used forever, but the way the stuttering synth riff seems to slow down in mid-tumble is unusual, like grime turned gelatinous. “Quandary,” a co-production with Darkstar, pairs the pinging of tilting pinball machines with a bouncy lead that's almost Caribbean in feel. It’s a disorienting listening experience, especially the drums' mismatched, tangled reverb tails. You feel torn different ways at once—which, given the title, might be the point.It’s not all so successful. The drab, bitcrushed “E.S.P.,” reminiscent of Actress’ desiccated atmospheres, feels longer than its three minutes; “Yeti,” an icy grime tune in the mold of Wiley’s “Eskimo” or “Igloo” is rather superfluous coming right after “Freeze,” another bright, brittle grime track that sounds absolutely fantastic. (Zomby presumably thought that placing such similar tunes together would be illuminating, and it is: He still hasn’t perfected the art of editing down his tracklists.) And some of his choices, like the gunshots and “Twin Peaks” monologue of “Reflection,” feel slightly uninspired for an artist whose public persona puts such a premium on audacity.But those are minor quibbles, because when he's on, he’s on. The sparkling “Glass,” the sorrowful “I,” the rough-cut jungle of “S.D.Y.F.” (“So Dance You Fuckers”), a collaboration with The Trilogy Tapes’ Rezzett—all of it finds Zomby sounding refreshed and invigorated. On the closing “Thaw,” he even sets the drums aside, lavishing all his attention on an absolutely gorgeous set of chords played on an absolutely gorgeous set of synthesizer patches. You can hear his passion for fashion coming to the surface here: It resembles draping; it sounds expensive, and it suggests that he’s still got a few tricks up his sleeve.\"],[22287,\"When Teenage Fanclub broke in 1991 with their third album Bandwagonesque, they were a band deeply of their time. The Scottish quintet was at once noisy enough to stand among trendsetters like Dinosaur Jr. and My Bloody Valentine, and melodic enough to fit seamlessly on post-“Alex Chilton,” Chilton-indebted college radio. The band’s zeitgeist-capturing breakthrough actually posed a threat to Nirvana come list-making season. In the wake of their banner year, however, Teenage Fanclub carved a quieter path, with each album feeling slightly less bold and more introverted. That’s not to say they retreated. As Teenage Fanclub’s heavier, gutsier proclivities subsided, they focused on becoming an even more sustainable machine, tightening up their songwriting and honing in their trademark three-part harmonies between vocalists Norman Blake, Gerard Love, and Raymond McGinley. As the years have passed and the band's output has slowed, Teenage Fanclub’s music has evolved like a long and stable love affair, propelled by intimacy, comfort, and shared admiration. In “I’m in Love,” the opening track on Here, Teenage Fanclub’s first album in six years, Blake actually makes the comparison himself. “I like your trajectory,” he sings, “I’m in love with you, love.” The lyric could be addressing a person or just the feeling itself: a tribute to an emotion. Sunny and deceptively complex, “I’m in Love” serves as a fitting introduction to Here, the band’s subtlest, warmest release to date and also one of their strongest.With their hushed production and contented lyrics, the 12 tracks on Here play like a series of quiet revelations, the kind of thoughts you have in moments of clarity, surrounded by people you love. The album’s best songs communicate that state of bliss with immediately gratifying melodies and effortless wisdom. The Love-penned “Thin Air” embraces the mystery of life with an energetic, Bad Reputation-era Thin Lizzy buzz. Equally euphoric is “The Darkest Part of the Night,” a sweet, autumnal exercise in classic pop songwriting, bobbing from hook to hook like the horses on a merry-go-round.  Even if Here, the band’s 10th album, finds Teenage Fanclub comfortable with their identity and largely uninterested in testing its boundaries, they still find some room for experimentation. McGinley’s contributions, particularly “Steady State,” and Love's quietly triumphant “I Have Nothing More to Say,” are the most serpentine, psychedelic tracks the band have ever recorded. And on “The First Sight,” the album’s dizzying highlight, they spin the well-trodden ’90s loud-quiet-loud dynamic into the aural equivalent of leaving a dim apartment and feeling the sun on your face. The song reaches pure ecstasy by the time it concludes with one of the album’s many fuzzy, impeccable guitar solos.The greatest moments on Here come when Teenage Fanclub use their music to uplift, as in the cascading horns in “The First Sight” or the glimmering strings in “The Darkest Part of the Night.” They’re slightly less successful when they try to convey these feelings with their words. The deeply literal choruses of “Hold On” and “Live in the Moment” land with a healthy dose of cheese, an aspect of pop music that Teenage Fanclub have always gracefully skirted around. But, to paraphrase Norm McDonald, it’s not sentimental if you really mean it. And judging by how many tracks on Here make reference to the simple joy of being alive, Teenage Fanclub sound like a band grateful for the time they have and entirely present within it.\"],[22344,\"If there’s an animating principle that runs through all of clipping.’s work to date, it’s a willingness to challenge expectations at every turn. To recap, in the past, the L.A. rap trio have swapped out low-end—a traditional pillar of hip-hop’s sound—for high-pitched noise. They once created a drum track entirely from recordings of gunshots. They’ve forced themselves to jump through conceptual hoops—their previous full-length completely eschewed use of the pronoun “I.” And they’ve built a rap song around a power electronics sample from Whitehouse. All of this headiness makes a bit more sense when you consider the band members’ recent outside pursuits: William Hutson finished a Ph.D. dissertation on experimental music, Jonathan Snipes composed film scores, and Daveed Diggs won both a Grammy and a Tony for his performance in the runaway hit musical, Hamilton.clipping.’s latest full-length, Splendor & Misery, might just be their most challenging release yet. It’s a hip-hop space opera of sorts, one that, according to the band, “follows the sole survivor of a slave uprising on an interstellar cargo ship, and the onboard computer that falls in love with him.” Calling the album high-concept feels like an understatement. This is the rare rap release that draws inspiration in equal parts from prog-rock and P-funk.Certainly, it’s difficult to question the quality of the raw materials used here. Founding members Snipes and Hutson skillfully evoke the hum of the ship’s machinery with their bleeps, bloops, and shuddering waves of static. Though it should come as no surprise, Diggs’ rapping is technically impressive, if a bit clinical, throughout Splendor & Misery. On “The Breach,” for example, the rapper dexterously spits tongue-twisting lines for 40 straight seconds. His rapid-fire delivery brings to mind Busdriver and André 3000.Splendor & Misery’s best songs manage to succeed on their own terms, independent of the overarching narrative. “All Black” sets up the storyline in third-person: “So the danger, clear and present\\/Is presented as the gift of freedom\\/Wrapped in days of rapping to himself\\/Up until his vocal chords collapse.” It nods toward the familiar with turns of phrase (the “all black everything” vacuum of space) and playful anachronisms. “Air ’Em Out” is a trap anthem in zero-gravity, its gleaming synths and skittering drums floating skyward with no bassline to hold them down. Diggs allows his tightly-wound delivery to go slack here, imbuing the track with a looseness and personality that’s sorely missing from much of the album.As with much of clipping.’s work, the ambition is admirable: using a rap album for an Afrofuturist take on 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unfortunately, most of Splendor & Misery’s songs rely on the narrative to propel them forward, not the other way around. Many of these tracks lack an identifiable rhythm section and feel more like spoken-word. It’s possible to create compelling hip-hop instrumentals from shards of noise—just look at Food for Animals and Death Grips or clipping.’s previous work—but on Splendor & Misery, clipping. often prize well-placed sound effects over songcraft. In its drive for conceptual rigor, the album neglects to engage the listener musically. That puts a lot of weight on the story, which tends toward the abstract. Perhaps Splendor & Misery’s plot would be better-suited to another medium—the hip-hop musical is, after all, enjoying something of a moment on Broadway.\"],[22286,\"Since Johanne Swanson started recording wandering indie pop songs as Yohuna in 2010, she’s picked up her whole life and moved over 500 miles more than a handful of times. She's had stints in Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Berlin; Los Angeles; and has now spent the last year and change living in New York City. In interviews, she blames this pattern of movement and the general restlessness that’s accompanied the long wait between her releases. For whatever reason, until now, she’s been unable to slow down, to center herself—and to finish the songs that she’d been working out in her head all the while.But at the tail end of last year she went to another new city, Montreal, to work with some longtime friends—including guitarist Adelyn Strei, Told Slant’s Felix Walworth, Florist’s Emily Sprague, Foxes in Fiction’s Warren Hildebrand, and string-arranger-to-the-stars and multi-instrumentalist Owen Pallett—on an album called Patientness that was meant as a summation of this period of drifting and waiting. The circumstances of its creation during a cold Canadian winter after years wandering in the wilderness may suggest that the record might be a collection of frayed ends or muddled feelings. But what’s always been most comforting about Swanson’s songwriting is the way she can make even the wildest emotions feel centered. From the album’s first moments, on the chilly, synthesizer-led “Lake,” she sings of turmoil on a global level. A multitracked vocal take swims through a few drifting guitar lines, and when she whispers “this world’s just not kind” during the song’s wispy chorus, she does it not as a moment of catharsis or pained mourning, but as a simple statement of fact. Like all the best slowcore songs, the pieces on Patientness are lumbering and weighty, but there’s a peace about them—as if Swanson’s chosen to accept the bad in the world and press onwards rather than sit and sulk. It’s a trick she repeats throughout. The dizzy “Creep Date” proceeds similarly, the brittle crack of a synthetic snare punctuation on all of her dead-eyed, reverb-laden proclamations: “Not confused\\/Still feel used.” Those lines curdle on the page, but when caught in the gentle wheeze of a synthesizer line that wouldn’t sound out of place on an Angelo Badalementi piece, Swanson’s able to soften the emotions. Everything comes out flattened, but not in a way that lessens their impact. Her delivery throughout Patientness has the effect that can only come from time and perspective, like the fragile-yet-self-assured quality of a catch-up conversation about everything that’s gone wrong in your life with friend who’s been away for a while.The full-band arrangements, in contrast to the spare keyboard exercises on Revery, serve to underscore that calm confidence at the record’s heart. On “Badges,” a version of which initially appeared a couple of years ago on a compilation for Orchid Tapes (the small New York label that’s releasing Patientness), Swanson interweaves a few synthesizer lines with plinks of a piano and some percussion reverberating in the distance. It’s delicate and deceptively complex, but in the midst of it all, there’s a gentle propulsion—cautious steps forward in spite of the haze that surrounds it. She mirrors it in the lyrics, bouncing back from self-doubt with a chorus that’s absorbed all of the peace, hope, and love she’s found on the long, turbulent journey to Patientness. In spite of it all, she sings, “I am radiating light.”\"],[22212,\"The hippies inspired a wholesale revision of marketplace calculations. Out-there experiments, previously indulged as pet projects, suddenly drew greater interest in certain media boardrooms. And that was before Woodstock demonstrated the scale of American youth culture to the country at large. After that long weekend, not every proposal needed to make complete sense to the entire executive suite. As Dennis Hopper’s 1969 directorial debut Easy Rider developed into a smash, actor Peter Fonda observed that film bosses stopped “shaking their heads in incomprehension,” the better to start nodding their heads with incomprehension. This same new taste for the unexpected also secured some leeway for avant-gardists laboring inside the major label system.In 1965, composer David Behrman began working as a tape editor for CBS’s Columbia imprint. By 1967, his bosses trusted his taste enough to let him curate a series of albums that documented the American experimental scene. The first Behrman-produced LP included Steve Reich’s “Come Out,” as well as electronic works by Pauline Oliveros and Richard Maxfield. Half a decade later, Columbia’s “Music of Our Time” series would be defunct. (A similar fate awaited Hopper’s directorial career, after 1971’s astonishing and truly bewildering The Last Movie.) But in the operational time they had, Behrman and his colleagues at Columbia’s classical division introduced an impressive variety of artists to the label’s catalog, as well as to the record-buying public.Terry Riley benefited the most from this small window of mainstream exposure. By the time Behrman discovered the artist performing in a small New York apartment, the slender Californian had the receding hairline and shoulder-length locks of an underground elder. Already in his thirties, Riley had fashioned a personal sound from an unusual collection of influences. As a young man, he made money playing barroom jazz piano. When simultaneously working toward a composition degree at Berkeley, Riley became entranced by the music of La Monte Young—a fellow student who scandalized the faculty in 1958 with a nearly hour-long string trio that contained just 83 notes. Young’s use of sustained tones in his Trio for Strings offended those classmates who were conditioned to expect speed and complexity in any ambitious piece of contemporary classical music. Riley, though, was galvanized by Young’s few, long notes.When completing his degree, Riley responded to Young’s pioneering work with string compositions that also employed sustained tones. But he ventured new methods for their use, too. While Young’s Trio held fast to an atonal method of organization prized by European composers, Riley’s String Trio of 1961 reasserted the role of conventional tonality. His focus on quick modal repetition didn’t merely help distinguish his sound from Young’s inside the canon of music that would eventually be called “minimalism.” It also primed Riley to make unique use of the fast-developing field of tape manipulation. By spooling tape through two machines—the first to record, the second to play back—Riley arrived at an early form of live-performance sampling that he would incorporate into scores for theatrical and dance performances. To create the pieces collected on the album Music for the Gift, Riley recorded each instrumentalist in Chet Baker’s band, as they played Miles Davis’ “So What,” then sampled and looped each musical layer to a point that made recognition of the source material impossible. Later that decade, when the CBS producer drifted into the composer’s New York apartment, he encountered Riley’s mature form of improvising along with these self-sampling, “lag time” tape loops. Behrman remembered seeing Riley’s reel-to-reel recorder: “And he was performing saxophone with two Revoxes, with the tape running from one to the other. It just blew me away, I’d never heard anything like it; it was just amazing.” Behrman’s first CBS recording of Riley’s music was devoted to In C, perhaps the most famous minimalist composition of all (which Riley wrote in 1964). Though because the core triumph of In C resides in the way its charms can survive the structure’s openness, the piece has been more influential as a score that invites multiple approaches than as a fixed-media recording. It was Behrman's second LP of Riley’s music that would have a greater impact as a stand-alone album.Your ambitious, local chamber orchestra might put on a shattering version of In C, but no one has ever played A Rainbow in Curved Air with anything close to the composer’s authority. By capturing Riley as both a conceptualist and as a virtuoso performer, this 1969 LP revealed a suppleness that stands in contrast to the baggage associated with “minimalism.” The range displayed over its two sides reaches out to the world (and, yes, the cosmos) rather than sitting inside any restrictive aesthetic field. As a result, the album can simultaneously suggest a feel of hurtling liftoff as well as one of peaceable calm.Side A’s heavily overdubbed title track features the composer on a range of keys: electric organ, electric harpsichord, rocksichord (also a favorite of Sun Ra’s), as well as two percussion items (dumbec and tambourine). Once the fast, opening pattern of “Rainbow” has been established, a series of placid chords superimposes a sense of ease. And then comes an explosion, a procession of right-hand lines that flutter and pirouette over the over the pulsing rhythmic patterns. That this powerful influx of energy doesn’t make the music feel cluttered or harsh is one of Riley’s compositional achievements.Though Riley’s drug-assisted “all night flight” concerts of the period might focus on this piece for hours at a clip, the 19-minute LP iteration has a traditional, fast-slow-fast feel. A generally mellower second movement focuses on shorter high-register lines that syncopate with the modal base. And after a repetition of those delay-strewn chords—this time voiced with a searing edge—the final section of “Rainbow” accelerates again, thanks to Riley’s use of the dumbec, informed by his appreciation of Indian classical music.Riley has always talked openly about his use of marijuana and LSD during early performances of this album, but there’s no mistaking his final results for being haphazard or sops to the drug-fashions of that era. After opening with a few minutes of saxophone drones, the loops that form the basis of Side B’s “Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band” cut out—a choice that initially seems as disruptive as the first jump cut in Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless. Like the filmmaker, Riley builds this technique into its own language. Once your ear is trained to recognize it, continued interruption of the drone feels like a vamp all on its own. The possibility of an unexpected, violent edit then hovers over the gorgeous, sustained-tone melody that “Nogood” develops after the opening drone-field disappears.The composer’s integration of avant-garde editing techniques within a jazz-influenced style helps communicate this album’s roving, idealistic feel. The original LP’s jacket art featured a short poem by Riley that envisioned the Pentagon “turned on its side and painted purple, yellow & green within a plainly psychedelic environment.” Some back covers of CD reissues have done without this supplement. The erasure could be mere oversight—or it might have been a conscious decision made to help the record avoid seeming dated by any suggestion of Vietnam-era protest.Unlike “head” movies and other cultural artifacts produced in the late-sixties, both sides of A Rainbow in Curved Air have long had an irony-free claim on contemporary tastes. The frantic but joyful electric keyboard texture of “Rainbow” was adopted by Pete Townshend on “Baba O’Riley” (the title of which gives due credit to its inspiration), and its psychedelic patterns were still modern-sounding enough to work as as “chill out” music in “Grand Theft Auto IV.” The artisanal brewers at Grimm Ales recently named one of their beers after this album. (When I told Riley this, during an interview, he sounded delighted: “They should send me some!”)These cosigns in popular culture would likely be enough to commend the album to successive generations, at least as a footnote. But another signal of A Rainbow in Curved Air’s lasting importance is the way in which Riley’s innovations as a performer-composer changed American classical music. The composer-led ensembles centered around Steve Reich and Philip Glass are hard to imagine without Riley’s example (as well as that of Young’s). In his autobiography, the composer John Adams—one of the most frequently performed American composers of the present-day—recalls first encountering the “congenial hippie spirit” of Riley’s music. Along with the rest of the early-minimalist catalog, the simple fact of this aesthetic’s existence suggested to Adams that “the pleasure principle had been invited back into the listening experience.” None of this was an accident. Nor was it the product of a cynical attempt to get in good with the Summer of Love crowd. This still-new language in American classical music has not always enjoyed the support of major labels. But the musical minimalism that Riley helped originate has nonetheless been a permanently joyous fixture in the American landscape, in part because of the feeling that Riley credited to his focus on modal playing: “My own spirit felt happy with it. I could do it for a long time and still feel good, still feel balanced and centered.” Midway through Easy Rider, Jack Nicholson’s character notes that “it’s real hard to be free when you’re bought and sold in the marketplace.” A few minutes later, he’s beaten to death. The explosive conclusion of Hopper’s film can be read as a self-aware commentary on the unsustainable nature of some hedonistic paths. By contrast, Riley’s “balanced and centered” approach to psychedelia consumes a wild energy without the chaser of destruction. Once the hippie phenomenon ran its pop-culture course, and after Columbia lost interest in modern composition altogether, Riley self-published his own music for several decades. And he never burned out as a creative force. Now 81, Riley still composes for string quartets and orchestras with an intuitive, form-breaking glee. His live piano improvisations are still mesmerizing. The musical structures heard at these concerts—and on A Rainbow in Curved Air—are the product of his unique understanding of chance and design. The rebellious pleasure-seekers of Easy Rider may have “blown it” in the end, but Riley’s musical revolution has proved spiritually and artistically sustaining.\"],[22353,\"De La Soul have been positioned as everything from young hippie weirdos to aging, jaded scolds in the face of their more hardcore contemporaries. But the truth is that they’re just smart, grounded wiseasses whose eccentricities alternately hid or let slip their everyman status. If the clean-cut white yuppie who came in for U2 and came out with De La Soul was positioned semi-ironically at their start, their current position as elder statesmen of rap comes from their crossover eclecticism fine-tuned into a true-to-self versatility. They began showcasing a post-genre adventurousness in the ’80s, opened doors for alt-rap’s next wave in the ’90s, and spent the first half of the ’00s getting Damon Albarn, Chaka Khan, and Carl Thomas to share iPod space. Then they vanished.Calling De La Soul’s hiatus a disappearance isn’t that much of an exaggeration: In their absence, the new record industry streaming model turned their history of innovative sampling and cultural interpolation against them, and the clearance and rights issues that locked them out of digital distribution posited them as one of the most important, and possibly the last, true holdouts of the CD era. But they had to keep their name out there somehow and found a way around the record business unable to maintain their legacy by funding their music through Kickstarter, just like regular folks (albeit more than $600,000 above most regular folks’ goals). They’ve also come to a phase in their career where an artistic existential crisis is scraping up against the getting-old anxiety that the rest of their Gen X peers are making a big public deal about. And working through that on record might be their most down-to-earth move yet.and the Anonymous Nobody... is their first album since 2004’s The Grind Date, which featured a still-prolific MF DOOM, a still-peaking Ghostface, and a still-living J Dilla. This one features an equally notable and telling guest list: there’s David Byrne organizing an art-neurosis summit on “Snoopies,” there’s Damon Albarn turning “Feel Good Inc.” inside out on “Here in After,” there’s Snoop Dogg (“Pain”) and 2 Chainz (“Whoodeeni”) and Roc Marciano (“Property of Spitkicker.com”) mastering their own cool, dad-jokey versions of Over-35 rap to go along with De La’s version. Their dozen-year absence and the fact that Pos and Dave and Maseo are all going to hit 50 before the decade is out looms over all that, and it turns a comeback story into more of a claim to their legacy.It’d be easier to shake off that feeling if there was more of a kick to this record. If your impression of “old man rap” is short on energy and long on reflection, this album won’t change that. At times, Anonymous Nobody feels more like a matter of necessity than enthusiasm, even if the work put into it proves it’s not. When it sounds tired and bummerish, it’s more in keeping with the hazy enervation of contemporary Drake-casualty rap than the proto-backpacker energy of their old joints. And while their casual, collected deadpan was always key to their delivery, Dave and Posdnous aren’t so much rusty as they are restrained in their down moments, all heavy eyelids and middle-distance stares. The flow’s still there—Pos remains way underrated in terms of disjointed, unpredictable rhyme schemes, and Dave still has a way of injecting that characteristic “huh, how about that” understated sharpness into his words—but the energy’s more stoic than ever.Which makes sense, given the thread of tribulation and frustration that cuts through Anonymous Nobody, likely their bleakest record thematically since Stakes Is High. All the relationships they bring up seem to have been doomed long ago. “Drawn” and “Memory of... (US)” is all about trying to persist through faded love, depicted damningly as a metaphor for music-biz struggle. When they’re telling ass-chaser tales like “Trainwreck” or Dave’s verse in “Whoodeeni,” it’s all so tenuous that they have to bring in a 67-year-old man character in for an interstitial skit to remind them they need to get less reckless about hookups. If that sometimes lends itself to dated tropes—a “morally pure but naive young girl comes to the big city and gets corrupted” rap like “Greyhounds” sounds bad coming from a bunch of middle-aged dudes, even if one of those dudes is Usher—that's a side effect of dealing with accumulated experience.There’s still no questioning De La’s greatness with observational abstraction. “Royalty Capes” isn’t just a juxtaposition of opulent-kingdom metaphors and gimme-what’s-mine industry beef, it’s the best type of convoluted wordplay: “I choke the blood out of felt tips\\/Heavyweights up to the front if the belt fits\\/The wealth is like ivory toothpicks\\/One out of each tusk\\/And must gets bust for each and every hiccup.” And “Pain” runs through its weary streak with been-there resilience, as if to say that if this shit’s a constant, it might as well be your inspiration.There’s unexpected power in that weariness sometimes, but at low points, the big sinking weight of this record is their laconic flow and beats rarely make a case for themselves. At least when they had to tread water back in the day, they had a danceable electric piano hook to do it over. The live-band production and original musical composition is a good juke around any worries about sample rights, but too often the Rhythm Roots Allstars either keep it a little too tasteful (“Greyhounds” aims for the Miguel\\/Frank school of sumptuous future-soul and lands in a mattress commercial) or swing at pitches in the dirt (the arena rock of “Lord Intended,” featuring the Darkness’ Justin Hawkins, is easily the most inexplicable thing De La’s ever done). Pete Rock and Estelle just manage to bring that glow to “Memory of… (US),” but when it takes one of the greatest producers ever and an actual Crystal Gem to make a cut sound alive, it’s easy to wish the rest of the album had more to work with.Fortunately, the tasteful outnumbers the ridiculous throughout the record, and if you don’t expect tectonic shifts in the way live-band hip-hop beats sound, the cumulative effect is at least thoroughly pleasant. And sometimes thoroughly pleasant plus heavy bass is just what you need. And when the energy level spikes on the late-album P-Funk homage “Nosed Up,” it’s live enough to distract you from wishing there was more of it. It’s all kind of what a skeptic might expect from hip-hop’s most enduring outsiders coming to terms with finally being outside the youthful drive that helped break them in the first place. Middle-aged rap has rarely sounded more grown, with all the mixed-blessing perspective that comes with it. Anonymous Nobody is kind of a downer, but sometimes that’s what you need, especially when the optimism’s just below that melancholy surface. If De La can find their place again after being gone so long, those clouds have got to break eventually.\"],[22349,\"Back in 1987, the ROIR label released a tape called New York—one of many rather roughshod titles from the then-cassette-only New York outpost. The quasi-legit collection almost sounded like a bootleg, the kind of thing that would be traded in dubs from fan to fan. New York was the only live Mekons album ever in-print (though it was reissued in 2001 as New York: On the Road 86-87). That changes now with Existentialism. Similarly, Existentialism also often sounds like a boot, but that’s a deliberate artistic decision. It was reportedly recorded around a single microphone at the Jalopy Theater in Red Hook, Brooklyn. At times, the rhythms overwhelm, yet this isn’t precisely a record that rocks. The Mekons long ago began weaving in elements of American country and British folk, threading it through the nervy art-punk at their core, a maneuver that only gains resonance as the band slides into middle age; it’s defiance that has turned into a credo. Older they may be, but they’re restless, and when Existentialism was recorded in the summer of 2015, the songs were as new to the band as they were to the audience. The Mekons chose to cut the songs not long after composition, a move that only underscores the urgency behind the project.Despite the haste, there are no stumbles on Existentialism, though there is rawness. The group is too good to let things careen out of control, but they’re smart enough to play upon the suggestion that things could. Certainly, this adds passion to the performance; it’s the sound of a great band creating great noise. The album pushes levels into the red, but sometimes it suggests more sonic detail than could be achieved from one mic. There’s little separation in the harmonies, and plenty of midrange smear, but instruments pop to the forefront.Beneath the racket, there are ideas—some expanded upon in an accompanying 96-page book and the Mekonception video that documents the whole shebang—but they’re impossible to ignore in the songs themselves. Images of terror, upheaval, and loss float through the words. Turmoil bubbles to the surface on “Fear and Beer,” a pub singalong for the age of Brexit, but “1848 Now!” makes allusions to revolution past, one of several sly nods to history. The best musical tip of the hat is how “The Cell” plays with the melody of Hank Williams’ “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry” without ever following its contours.Politics and tradition are nothing new to the Mekons, but what makes Existentialism resonate is that it’s an album of the moment, for the moment. As an aural document, it’s kinetic and crackling, a live recording that captures the excitement of a concert. As a complete piece, it says something powerful; it’s a call to arms for old punks, unrepentant artists, and assorted freaks, all pushing against the tides of modern life. It’s the Mekons and friends and family gathering together in a small room, shouting songs of protest and singing sad melodies, realizing there’s strength in being together, even if their numbers are dwindling.\"],[22337,\"At its inception, punk wasn’t just an attack on ’70s rock excess but on the very idea of entertainment. By holding up a mirror shard to society’s ills, punk’s message was that entertainment-as-escapism was a luxury we could no longer afford. When the E-word is dropped in a punk context, it hits like an F-bomb—from Gang of Four’s Entertainment! to Sleater-Kinney’s “Entertain,” the sentiment is dripping in sarcasm and spite. So when Nots singer\\/guitarist Natalie Hoffman shouts “Entertain me\\/Tell me who to be!” on her band’s second album, she’s in good, caustic company: By setting her crosshairs on the conformist, intellectually corrosive effects of pop culture, she reminds us that punk’s primary function is not to amuse, but to abuse.“Entertain Me” is the sneering last song on Cosmetic, the follow-up to the Memphis foursome’s 2014 debut, We Are Nots. For a band that once dealt in 48-second blurts, the track’s seven-minute sprawl offers a convincing gauge of their growth; their double-timed rhythmic thrust stretches out hypnotically as Hoffman’s guitar stake out new spaces between piercing punk aggression and amorphous, art-damaged squall. To borrow a pair of songs from their debut, the Nots still make songs out of black mold and white noise—a combustible, crudely rendered fusion of ’60s garage-rock, ’70s post-punk, ’80s hardcore, and ’90s riot grrrl. But where the shout-along chants of We Are Nots were at least hooky enough to not completely scare away the bookers at Memphis morning talk shows, Cosmetic is uninterested in cultivating any crossover territory the band may have been accidentally trod upon the first time around. Like a boxer who’s just taken a gulp of water and had their cuts jellied, the Nots have leapt right back into ring angrier, bloodier, and eager to do more damage.Where their debut attacked such pointed trash-culture targets as televangelists and psychic talk shows, Cosmetic is fueled by a more existential angst. While she still deals in terse Morse code melodies, Hoffman’s invectives are even more distorted and less decipherable, though song titles like “Inherently Low” and “No Novelty” leave little room for confusion. Melodies rumble and roil like an upset stomach. Before, keyboardist Alexandra Eastburn complemented the band’s trash ‘n’ bash with the standard synth-punk effects of ray-gun zaps and carnivalesque swirls; on Cosmetic, she lurks lower in the mix but her presence is all the more amplified through disorienting drones and queasy oscillations that permeate these songs like a thick fog.From the all-tension, no-release surge of opener “Blank Reflection” to the creepy, echoing incantations of “Fluorescent Sunset,” Cosmetic conjures the white-knuckled feel of careening down a bumpy backwoods road in the dead of night, Eastburn’s quivering keyboards serving as the lone, flickering headlights. But the Nots’ growing affinity for sonic experimentation never feels at odds with their innate punk-rock primtivism. Rather, Cosmetic’s stewing textural undercurrent intensifies the band’s outer antagonism by highlighting the trembling, deep-seated dread within. It’s riveting and ruining in equal measure.\"],[21989,\"At first glance it might seem unfair that the Smiths' bassist Andy Rourke’s initials are at the center of D.A.R.K.: Dolores O’Riordan of The Cranberries is only alluded to with the D from her first name and the K represents the last name of Olé Koretsky, a DJ, producer, and singer who had been working with Rourke under the moniker of JETLAG since 2009. Thankfully, D.A.R.K. does not present themselves as a supergroup and the songs on their debut hardly rest on their members’ laurels. But upon close listens to Science Agrees, it will start to make sense why Rourke gets both of his initials right in the middle of the band name.Although O’Riordan and Koretsky handle all of the vocals, Rourke’s bass is right in the center of the mix throughout the whole album, presented as a lead instrument. It exposes his playing to extra scrutiny and it sometimes sounds dated. It’s not like he’s doing that same old three-note walk up from “Frankly, Mr. Shankly.” It’s more like he’s turning up a little too loud while trying out a new rig at Guitar Center, and proving to anybody within earshot that he knows how to slap. He also digs up a few unlikely influences, and even sounds on occasion like the only other person who could arguably be Manchester’s most famous bassist. But for the most part, Rourke’s playing is tasteful and original, and it’s about time he wasn’t completely overshadowed by Johnny Marr.Placing this much emphasis on the bass makes the rest of the tracks on the mixer far more subtle. O’Riordan’s voice is underutilized, but she’s not here to belt out “Zombie.” Cranberries fans might be the only group of people who are already fans of Koretsky, whose voice blends with O’Riordan’s in oddly sweet ways. The pair singing together means that a lot of the songs often take on multiple points of view. It’s sometimes like “Don’t You Want Me” if the male character was a morbid creep, like in “Loosen the Noose,” where O’Riordan sings “somebody’s walking close behind me,” and Koretsky later sings, “I found true love six feet below.” “Gunfight” includes both of them singing together, “I remember your eyes, hip to the fact that we’re all gonna die.” They also do a lot of whispered vocals and forlorn deep breathing into the mics. The album flows well, effortlessly segueing from Achtung Baby-like rock to mechanical new wave like Depeche Mode and Pet Shop Boys. O’Riordan and Koretsky sing simple lyrics, often repeating the same phrase over and over, allowing alternate meanings to sink in. Another subtle tactic they employ is to differentiate parts of songs by singing different vocal lines over the same chord progressions, finding enchanting new melodies out of a familiar sound. It's the greatest thing that can happen for the three storied musicians in D.A.R.K.\"],[22282,\"In 2010, Angel Olsen was a folk singer. Her first great song, “If It’s Alive, It Will,” sounded radically spare, like it had been recorded inside of a closet, or perhaps in another world. It contained some three-dozen epiphanies—one for each line. “Know your own heart well\\/It’s the one that’s worth most of your time,” Olsen sang, a mantra so disarming and wise it could cut through the thickest lo-fi fog. “If It’s Alive, It Will” was pure empathy. You might implant it in your brain as a reminder of how to live. You could never forget, then, that solitude begets possibility, or that loving a person can transform your mind, or that someone in the universe is currently as lonely as you. “If It’s Alive, It Will” embodied the poised philosophy of Olsen’s songbook to come. Introverted dreamers—people who are quiet on the outside while the world rages so loudly within them—always live by this loner logic. Olsen gave it a melody.Modern noises vanish when Olsen sings. From the bracing incantations of 2012’s Half Way Home to Olsen’s folk-rock opus, 2014’s Burn Your Fire for No Witness, her name is now synonymous with a voice. Each note tells a story. Hers are tales of absolute yearning and resilience. They honor the romance of being alone in your head. Olsen has perfected the idea that it is still possible—if language is precise enough, if the truth of your music is as elemental as color or blood—to write oneself out of time. Her lyrics have the conviction of someone like Fiona Apple: a profoundly individual presence that centers, above all, on self-reliance, on searing autonomy, on the act of becoming. My Woman does this more vividly and lucidly and daringly than before. If Burn Your Fire was Olsen’s poetic manifesto, then My Woman lives freely within its world. Together, the two albums remind me of something Patti Smith once said, in 1976, distinguishing the literary Horses from its follow-up, Radio Ethiopia, by calling the latter “total physical energy” and also more implicitly feminine. My Woman walks a tightrope of love to figure out what it is—how to find it, how to allow it in, how to feel it, how to fight for it, how to let it go—by a person who does not lose herself in the process.The upbeat A-side ranges from the sun-kissed to the blindingly bright. In the final moments of Burn Your Fire, Olsen asked, “Won’t you open a window sometime\\/What’s so wrong with the light?” and here she responds. She offers witty and taunting rhinestone-cowgirl come-ons that would make Dolly and Loretta proud. She lets loose a piercing, guttural, King-sized “Baby!” that shoots fire into the red. She shrieks “I’m still yours!” with sublime vivacity. My Woman contains soda-pop rippers as pained and distraught and irreducible as any girl-group classic: “Heaven hits me when I see your face,” Olsen sings with wide-eyed optimism that wilts on arrival, “But you’ll never be mine.” So much of My Woman is rock‘n’roll in the traditional sense, from a ’50s or ’60s jukebox, and it is positively electric, a total blast.“Intern,” the synth meditation of an opener, is all shivers, a borderless dream-pop song that never quite begins or ends. It’s about the inescapable necessity, for all people, of figuring out who you are: “Still gotta wake up and be someone.” The winding synth melody has a surreal, Lynchian, merry-go-round shine. “I just wanna be alive\\/Make something real,” Olsen sings, a surprisingly conversational and sensible proposition. “Shut Up Kiss Me” has all the rapture of a black-and-white stop-action movie, with slapstick country humor: “Stop pretending I’m not there\\/When it’s clear that I’m not going anywhere,” Olsen sings. “If I’m out of sight then take another look around!” In the videos for both songs, Olsen donned a synthetic silver wig, bringing to mind the makeup of her beloved Dolly Parton: “I look so totally artificial, but I’ve always been the simplest person in the world,” Dolly has said. “I knew that there was wisdom and naturalness in me. The way I looked so false and was so real made a nice combination. It’s my fun.”But Olsen’s fun songs—bright and sweet as they are—are a bit deceiving. The arrangements carry the levity and mania of infatuation, the feeling of total flight, but even here, Olsen’s writing is heavy as ever. (The poet Frank O’Hara once wrote, “each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous,” which is a fine synopsis of My Woman and the glitter that tempers its aching.) “Never Be Mine” sounds like the ’60s in Caetano Veloso’s Brazil, or Spanish guitar music. “Give It Up” puts a pure “Cathy’s Clown” melody over open Nirvana strums. They’re love songs, but it can never last, and inside all of them, there seems to be a message about the impossibility of ownership, which “Not Gonna Kill You” sings: “A love that never seems to curse or to confine\\/Will be forever never lost or too defined... However painful let it break down all of me\\/’Til I am nothing else but the feeling.” Like all of My Woman, it’s tough and tender at once, a bold rumination on how love and autonomy require one another.And then the record slows. As “Woman” and “Sister” sprawl defiantly towards their eight-minute marks, Olsen’s warble stretches into impressionistic waves. The command of Olsen’s vibrato is wild but controlled—which is to say anarchic—and as the songs get longer, they communicate molecularly, contain more feeling, a haunted drama. The twilight jazz of “Those Were the Days” sparkles like city lights in water at night. On the ecstatic and feverish rave-up “Sister,” the guitar arrangement is enthralling, putting the starry tone of Marquee Moon inside a scorched Crazy Horse jam. “I dare you to understand,” Olsen later boils, “What makes me a woman.” The answer is in the nonlinear alchemy of her corporeal song.The closer is a raw piano ballad called “Pops.” It is impossibly stark. Olsen’s voice sounds like it is pressed up against glass. “If you want the rainbow,” Dolly Parton once philosophized, “you have to put up with the rain.” “Pops” is all blurred raindrops, recalling Cat Power on You Are Free with the wonder of Judy Garland. Olsen sounds like she’s just been emptied of every tear in her body. The salt makes “Pops” glisten. It’s so filmic and classic-sounding that you can practically see a sole red balloon floating against the grey of a cityscape. “Pops” is Olsen’s heaviest song; it’s exhausting. But if ever there were proof that it is possible for life to be gorgeous and fucked-up in equal measure, at the same time, this song is it. Burn Your Fire was Olsen’s detailed film treatment, but My Woman goes big-screen; it’s Olsen as auteur. “Know your own heart well,” she sang in 2010, “You could be surprised at what you find.” But part of following your heart, of knowing yourself, is understanding that it’s not a fixed muscle. The heart changes; it grows. Its beat speeds and slows as a symptom of life. Here, on “Pops,” Olsen asks, “What is it a heart’s made of?” Maybe you never find out for sure; maybe it’s the unending search itself that becomes the compass of our being. Love is a maze with no way out. But My Woman suggests that the way in is through self-possession.\"],[22332,\"Big Black Coat was the sound of Junior Boys injecting their trademark sound (blue-eyed electro-soul and bedroom-confessional IDM) with techno vigor. Six months after Canadian electronic duo released their most stylistic quantum leap of their career, the Kiss Me All Night EP returns to the quiet, introspective feel Junior Boys were known for, all without compromising on their recent musical advancements. This isn't a record to light up the dance floor; it’s a record you put on at the beginning of the night, with its more minimal, ear-expanding instrumentation acting as a preamble to the harder, faster beats to come.That’s not to say that Kiss Me All Night completely drops Junior Boys’ newfound edge, it just dials back the rave. It draws more on European traditions of deconstructing dance music, rather the hot-blooded abandon other artists may see as the genre’s purpose. Teasing this border has always been an ace up Junior Boys’ sleeve, like on the EP’s opening track, “Yes.” The song coldly spirals around a recurring sample of a slurred vocal repeating “yeah” over and over, the pulsing synth swells becoming more and more hypnotic with each listen. Frontman Jeremy Greenspan’s whisper-croon weaves around the sample, always a blend between passionate lover and emotional car wreck. “Baby Fat” also makes good use of his vocals, as he softly sings of loves lost supported by a pop-rock guitar riff like something Lionel Richie would have pulled out in the mid-’80s.The centerpiece here is “Some People Are Crazy,” the closest thing Junior Boys will ever come to a power ballad, which it turns out sounds a lot like a tropical house banger slowed down 200 percent and thrown into the deep end of the Milky Way. It’s a cover of a song by British soft-rock icon John Martyn, a subtle touchstone for Junior Boys’ bookishly futuristic funk. Warm tones bubble atop a skittish drum beat that easily drifts through the middle of the record. While the original is a masterclass in electric piano and ultra-slack bass lines, the band have done a stellar job at folding “Some People Are Crazy” into their own mythology, retaining just enough of its retro feel to keep the through line between the past and the present. Recently, Junior Boys have adopted Prince as a rather prominent influence, but while Big Black Coat dipped into the Purple One’s electro-tinged “Controversy”-era, the languorously sexy “Kiss Me All Night” recalls the emotional maturity and erotic playfulness of Parade, with its metronomic disco beat and robotic keyboard stabs.Since the songs on Kiss Me All Night are good enough to warrant an official release but don’t quite mesh with the boldness of Big Black Coat, the EP feels a little light—at worst, an addendum, at best, a victory lap. However, it is still another transformation for Junior Boys, more proof that by continuously and decidedly evolving their musical identity, they will continue spinning gold out of their detail-oriented, almost scientific approach to dance music.\"],[22333,\"An actual serpent with feet is an image that belongs to a prelapsarian world. It’s a mythical reminder of original sin, and perhaps a symbol of lost potential, fallibility, desire, and all sorts of biblical things good and bad. It’s a hell of a name for a musical project, coded with all the grandeur and primordial muck of the Book of Genesis. serpentwithfeet is Josiah Wise, a classically trained singer who’s moved nomadically between neo-soul, funk, R&B, and a self-described style of pagan gospel—he finds refuge, takes lessons, and moves on. On his debut EP, blisters he’s enlisted Björk collaborator and producer the Haxan Cloak to help craft a world that boils with personal energy and is fantastically operatic in scale. blisters is a brief five-song EP, barely over 20 minutes long, but it’s gorgeously multivalent and strangely wrought, morphing that short timespan into an experience that is unabashedly vulnerable and powerfully queer. Its opening title track sounds simultaneously ancient and postmodern. Harps share space with thunderous electronic drums and belches of static creating a whirlpool of sounds that seems totally inhospitable until Wise’s voice threads it all together. A combination of spooky processing and classical inflections make his voice so affecting: shifting between whispers and moans, splitting off, multiplying, and taking root in your ears in such strange ways.The way his voice is used reminds me of Holly Herndon’s vocal experiments. It’s protean and malleable, at any time diffuse or concrete, and serves as the album’s most powerful instrument. In the following track “flickering,” Wise continues this experimentation by dissolving almost all instrumentation, and allowing his voice to luxuriate in its own timbre. It’s easy to get hypnotized by Wise’s singing, which borders on glossolalia in terms of its pounding spirituality, but when his words connect, they resonate right in the chest. On “flickering” in particular, Wise loves the melodrama (“I’m starting to feel the cord connecting us two is made of gossamer”), but he sells it by virtue of his delivery, thumbing the scale with emotional weight. When he says, “Don’t let me doubt you,” or, “I offer myself to you,” the pain goes from his mouth to your heart in a flash.It works because his music is theatrical. It demands you to sit down and pay attention. In particular, blisters invests in the megachurch and the opera, always looking for a safe landing between dogma and drama, faith and obsession. In songs like “four ethers” he leans into the glory of these forms. The song hangs on a motif of swirling atmospheric strings that are less Wagner or Puccini, but more like Hans Zimmer in effect, and it’s incredible if not a little cheesy. It works together with the tone of the song’s lyrics which are puncturing but somehow funny and self-mocking (“Your name is about as easy to remember as the four ethers\\/And who the hell knows the four ethers”).He’s also direct, visceral, and imagistic, recalling Frank Ocean’s knack for storytelling circa-Channel Orange: “Babe I know you learned some fucked up shit from your mother\\/Had you tucking your dick\\/Had you hiding the shit that really made you special.” He delivers these lines with a lilting falsetto, as Haxan Cloak’s noises and screeches of strings explode around him. In these personal disclosures of desire, sexuality, and failure, Wise can make individual and personal struggles seem mythic.  In addition to his subtly haunting textures, Haxan Cloak also makes Wise sound swaggering and enormous. It’s because Wise has intent and vision as he explores the difficulties of identity and the liquidity of the queer experience with a sly sense of humor. Listening to blisters, I was reminded of the bittersweet optimism of the theorist José Esteban Muñoz, who wrote, “Queerness should and could be about a desire for another way of being in both the world and time.” In blisters, Wise pauses to examine the ugliness of our world, then floats right past it to another way of being.\"],[22277,\"When you travel to 351 Jay Street on Google Maps you’re greeted with the image of a nondescript office building. On its ground floor is an art supply store. The rest of the scene is anonymous. Much of Downtown Brooklyn looks like 351 Jay: brutalist buildings of medium height that evoke industry and bureaucracy. Thirty-six years ago, in this building, William Basinski lived in a loft space that he called the Music Laboratories. He moved in at the beginning of the 1980s with his partner, the artist James Elaine.Most of the work Basinski released in the 2000s consisted of remixed, reworked, and wonderfully garbled homages to the archive he started to build in the Music Laboratories. While there he made hundred of tape loops, organizing the ribbons of magnetic tape on a tree branch he kept near his mixing desk. The loops were a combination of recordings of his own compositions and incidental noise that seemed to come his way from the whirl of urban life outside his window or from the whisper of radio broadcasts seeding themselves into his recording equipment. He didn’t release his experiments at the time, choosing to record, finagle, connect. The impulse was a natural reaction to the time and place, as he later said: “I was getting all this great stuff. It was just coming from the sky.”One day in September of 1982 he was experimenting on the fly, collecting fragments, and maybe hours later the backbone of a piece was made. He called it 92982, a clinical name designating the date of the composition, as if it was just a file to be tucked away. He released the recordings for the first time in 2009, long after he garnered widespread acclaim for his monumental 9\\/11 elegy The Disintegration Loops. Seven years after its initial release, 92982 has been remastered and reissued as 2xLP set of startlingly crisp and veritably haunted music.92982 is over an hour long, and the original improvisation makes up the first two tracks, while the back half of the album includes an extended rework of a piano-based piece from Variations: A Movement in Chrome Primitive and another loop constructed from the 1982 material. Given the sources, the tracks present in 92982 seem almost unstuck from time, floating between dates and points of inspiration. The continual cutting up, editing, and processing of a tape loop was something closer to necromancy than normal composition. It’s a quality that actually infects the overall feeling of the music, creating an environment for free-floating listening.The album’s opening track, “92982.1,” drifts, separates, grows quiet, and then rumbles loudly. The wash of noises is teeming with potential, a quality that defines the inner workings of 92982. All four tracks are open canvases, they invite the rest of the world’s sounds to participate in making the experience of listening different each time. The sound of a helicopter whirling in the atmosphere and the Doppler splatter of a police car’s siren on “92982.2” mix into the sounds of banal moments, like laying in bed, listening to the buzz of an air conditioner, the honking of cars, the rustle of leaves, the drip of an open faucet. The drifting of “92982.4”’s piano loops hang like flickering presences hovering above a room. Overall, a disembodying and strange thing slowly happens as this album keeps playing: it sucks the noises of your environment into the loop. What’s contained here is sometimes not exactly a piece of music but an experiential filter. Basinski’s music is constantly toying with the idea that rote moments in life can be engulfed with emotion, and it has a way of burrowing into your life. As his perpetual loops drift across the surface of experience, they are incredibly porous, and invite a listener to complete them by taking a walk around their block or just go about their day. 92982 accomplishes this more successfully than much of Basinski’s work; compared to  The Disintegration Loops, it’s more open to interpretation and devoid of the same weight of history or narrative. It is an extremely plastic and pliant piece of music, an eternally empty vessel that gets filled up from listen to listen.\"],[22329,\"As an artist, Young Thug thrives in between spaces. His chic, fresh-off-the-runway looks flirt with androgyny. Entire sequences of his raps unspool as nonsequiturs forcing listeners to extract meaning from bars of source code. Even the assorted ad-libs in his songs maximize the slightest pocket of air, exploding and retracting back through crevices in his unpredictable flows. He is constantly balancing opposing forces: masculine and feminine, light and dark, playful and humorless, pirouetting on a razor’s edge at all times. Modeling alongside Frank Ocean for Calvin Klein in July, he was as plainspoken about fluidity as he’s ever been. “In my world, of course, it don’t matter: You could be a gangster with a dress or you could be a gangster with baggy pants,” he said in his campaign video. “I feel like there’s no such thing as gender.” It’s this freedom, this refusal to define or label himself, and this progressive spirit that makes everything he does so daring and so mystifying. When industry mogul Lyor Cohen argued with Thug about being more accessible to listeners and more purposeful in thought and action on CNBC’s “Follow the Leader,” his response was simple: “I don’t want everybody just to know, like, ‘Oh, we know.’” The remove is everything to him. When he says or does something, he’s usually daring you to figure out why.Existing on incomprehensible terms has made Thug recherché to the casual rap fan, which is why his debut album turned retail mixtape, Barter 6, remains his greatest pivot of all. It’s cohesive, understated, and about as accessible as Thug gets, an ingenious turn from oddball rap archetype to intuitive master craftsman. Every release after it lives in its shadow: aimless hard drive dumps attempting to combat a massive data breach that leaked hundreds of Thug songs online last May. In the months since he eulogized his Slime Season trilogy (“All good things must come to an end, this is the birth of something new”), Thug teased snippets of new songs with captions that just read “JEFFERY.” Not long after, Cohen announced an official name change: No, My Name is Jeffery. A trailer for the mixtape found Thug in an interrogation room explaining to cops who he was. He wasn’t a young thug anymore. “I feel like I had a long-term relationship with Young Thug, and I’m kind of picky, so I felt like I didn’t want to be in front of a Bill Gates or Oprah Winfrey,” he explained at the Jeffery listening party. “I didn’t want my kids to grow up and call me Thug because in real-life terms Thug is thug.” It’s impossible not to interpret that as some sort of response to the current racial climate, where the word “thug” is used as a racist dog whistle; it’s his most obvious statement in ages. Jeffery is the first Young Thug release that considers identity. But the rapper is rarely ever literal in verse; he always opts to show, not tell.Though just as carefully sequenced and well-executed, Jeffery isn’t as tranquil, distant, or harmonious as Barter 6, which had cleansing, almost spiritual properties. Young Thug doesn’t often attempt the same thing twice, but this is perhaps his most chameleonic outing to date. The songs here are all named for his “idols”: Kanye West, former Fugee Wyclef Jean, pound-for-pound boxing king Floyd Mayweather, producer Swizz Beatz, Future, Rihanna, Gucci Mane, Webbie (of “Independent” fame), and Harambe. A careless listener might mistake them for actual song subjects. But these are all just misdirections. Outside of revealing small context clues about his origins as a stylist, and sometimes hinting at his mode or setting (like on “Future Swag”), this isn’t actually about any of those people. “Jeffery is all about Jeffery,” he explained at the listening party. “It ain’t even about Young Thug. Ain’t no Young Thug songs on there.” These are Jeffery songs, and from the sound of things, Jeffery’s greatest influence is his fiancé, Jerrika.The songs on Jeffery are brimming with romantic subtext—Skyping a lover while she’s overseas, doing things together (“bae drink your lean with me, bae fall asleep with me”), and simply being head over heels for her (“she know she got a nigga bad”). In the opening verse of “Guwop,” he digs everything she says, everything she does, and even the way she looks at him. At one point on “Harambe,” he straight up belts out, “I just want to have a baby by you, girl!” The mixtape swoons and swells, heart fluttering, as Thug waxes poetic about his baby. This is the primary thread woven through the tape, which isn’t so much a love story as a sex tape with loving inscriptions.Romance is at Jeffery’s core, but it’s driven by dynamic vocal performances others wouldn’t dare attempt—the pleading, bloodhound-ish yowl on “RiRi,” the breathless sprinter’s wheeze on “Harambe,” which explodes into a full-bodied Louis Armstrong impression, and the slinky yips on “Swizz Beatz.” The raps are delivered as mutters, shouts, and gasps, and flows are administered decisively and effectively. His wordplay is nimble and sharp, often using clever associations to create vivid imagery (“I picked my diamonds out a honey tree,” on “RiRi”; “I just got a family pack of Jimmy Choos” and “I got six brand new foreigns on my wrist\\/I got six Forgiatos on my fist,” on “Floyd Mayweather”). He has longstanding working relationships with every guest but one, and that repetition-built muscle memory shows in the results. He effortlessly passes the baton back and forth with Gunna and mentor Gucci Mane on “Floyd Mayweather,” picking up wherever the last trailed off. Duke, a standout guest on the Barter 6 cut “Dome,” smartly follows Thug’s lead on “Webbie.” The sole newcomer, Wyclef Jean, soothingly coos “Jeffery” over Thug’s shoulder on “Kanye West,” and it’s the optimal complement. There isn’t a word or note out of place.Despite his growing reputation as a flamboyant eccentric who lives outside the boundaries of traditional songcraft making quirky “post-verbal” rap defying convention, Thug understands the modern pop song construction better than anyone: anything and everything can be a hook. Finding hooks keeps the mind stimulated and euphoric, creating something John Seabrook calls the “bliss point” in his book, The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory. What separates Young Thug songs at their peak from other pop confections is how seamlessly the transitions occur, where they materialize, and what he’s using them to do. He doesn’t want to numb the brain; He wants to super-charge its synapses. Changes happen every few bars, they turn sharply, and they make big dramatic gestures. Take “Future Swag,” which uses repetition, rapidly alternating rhythms, and ad-libs to remain constantly mobile, shifting and morphing six times in the first minute. Or “Swizz Beatz,” where he creates his own echo, repeating phrases within verses (“with me, with me”; “‘bout it, ‘bout it”; “turn up for the”) and within the chorus itself (“love”) while creating alternate hooks with melody. Micro-hooks are hidden inside of hooks and it’s all brain candy.For nearly 42 minutes, Jeffery explores spacing, lines, form, texture, and beauty—all of which are exhibited in the mixtape’s mesmerizing artwork. The Atlanta rapper seemed to breathe life into the ideas first articulated at the Calvin Klein shoot with the cover, posed in a ruffling dress styled by Alessandro Trincone. While some people’s brains shut down at simply the sight of a man in a dress, the cover exhibits some of Thug’s strongest artistic traits: His eye for composition and stylishness, and his knack for testing limits and hurdling norms. Jeffery embodies these attributes in essence and detail. It’s rangy and stunning, an exciting new curve in the fascinating Young Thug arc.\"],[22338,\"Prince had a curious approach to live albums. After Purple Rain put his crowd-stunning skills on worldwide display, subsequent concert artifacts took the form of coffee table books or low-profile home video releases. And he could be a merciless tease. With “It’s Gonna Be a Beautiful Night,” from Sign ‘O’ the Times, Prince offered listeners an onstage clip of the Revolution operating at peak inspiration only after he’d broken up that band. During the compilation set Crystal Ball, the conclusion of a searing live take on “The Ride” is rudely cut off by the forgettable dance number \\\\\"Get Loose.\\\\\"These perversions are not unwitting. Prince knew admirers bootlegged his shows. Message boards on his various online “music clubs” were often clogged with requests for official live discs. In 2002, before his Musicology comeback, he gave these hardcore fans what they wanted, at long last. Sort of. One Nite Alone…Live! was a box set that chronicled the tour in support of Prince’s similarly titled piano-and-vocals CD. But these setlists also explored another recent Prince recording, The Rainbow Children—a concept album that heralded his conversion to the Jehovah’s Witness faith. Given the outlier that Children was in his catalog, a follow-up live release that repeated the same sermons over its first two discs was met with some frustration. Still, most detractors couldn’t ignore the third CD, which presented a rush of screaming blues licks, rowdy funk-ensemble workouts, and sultry soul, all captured during “aftershow” parties from this same tour. Years later, Prince carved out this third disc as a standalone title for sale on one of his websites. Similarly, it is now available for streaming and purchase on Tidal, along with the majority of the NPG Records catalog. There’s much to savor from that oft-overlooked wilderness period, but the urgent showmanship of One Nite Alone… The Aftershow: It Ain’t Over! makes it a highlight in Prince’s discography and a gratifying, much-needed connection with his ability to take it to the stage. While avoiding his biggest hits, this nearly hour-long ride finds Prince engaging with key selections from his repertoire. The opening song, “Joy in Repetition,” dates from sessions that produced Sign ‘O’ the Times, and was later included in the scattershot soundtrack to Prince’s box-office bomb Graffiti Bridge. Here, Prince airs it out for over ten minutes, recasting it as both a band-introduction tool and a showcase for his electric guitar showboating.Subtle revision of the song’s lyrics is as close as he comes to any lecturing on Aftershow. Prince ad libs a brief bit about his new aversion to “four-letter words,” though the singer’s come-hither delivery ensures that the change does no harm to the song’s slinky vibe. Gradually, his command of the blues emerges as the focal point of the performance. The unhurried stretches of soloing carry a different air than other Prince guitar clinics—such as his famed feature during a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tribute to George Harrison. He obsesses over individual passages with a spiritual ferocity that can stand with late-period Coltrane. It’s indulgent, excessive, and brilliant. Then George Clinton joins the band, and the intergenerational lineup of funk visionaries gels just like you’d hope. In the early going of “We Do This,” the track has a loose-booty feel that provides ideal support for Clinton’s scat-rap. And while Prince starts out by shooting rhythm guitar darts into the pocket, the jam climaxes when Clinton’s raspiest vocalizations spur some joyous, arcing lead lines from the bandleader. This song is the most compelling meeting between the two artists yet to see the light of day.The guest-vocalist portion of the show concludes with Musiq’s appearance during a brief medley that mixes his own tune “Just Friends (Sunny)” with Sly Stone’s “If You Want Me to Stay.” After the different extremes advanced by the opening two songs, this selection introduces the more relaxed aesthetic that Prince could use to make these late-night encounters with a global icon feel like casual parties. Since these recordings date from Prince’s peak period of overt jazz exploration, his backing band is skilled in the art of reinterpretation. The rhythm section of drummer John Blackwell and bassist Rhonda Smith helps transform deep cuts like the instrumental “2 Nigs United 4 West Compton” into something less nervy than Prince fashioned by himself during sessions for The Black Album. On Aftershow, the mood is exultant and celebratory.“I wanna sing, but it’s too funky,” the artist tells the crowd at one point. And then, after steering the band through a brisk “Alphabet Street,” he mostly dispenses with pop-song singing—all the better to work as a dance instructor for the rest of the album. During the infinity groove of “Peach (Xtended Jam),” Prince reminds concertgoers that this isn’t an arena rock show, but a club (“Ain’t nothing to look at; y’all just party where ya are.”) Then, at the turnaround, he unveils a new rhythm guitar progression: a line that begins with an aggressive stabbing figure, and then rolls on with delirious suavity. It’s a reminder of Prince’s guitar heroics outside the realm of the solo.The way the whole set works brings to mind black scholar Albert Murray’s understanding of the “Saturday Night Function” during the period of early jazz, which the theorist contrasted with the role of the Sunday morning gospel service. In discussion with Wynton Marsalis, Murray described the Function as “a purification ritual where you get rid of the blues. And as soon as you get rid of the blues, it becomes a fertility ritual. . . . The union of lovers, which is the salvation of the species! . . . If it’s not sexy, forget it.” On his “One Nite Alone” tour, Prince reversed the chronology, putting the sermons during the main gig, and providing erotic release at the aftershow. Both halves of the experience should be fascinating for any fan of this elite composer and performer. But if you’re downhearted by his absence, it may be that you'll want to turn to the blues-chasing set first. Unlike the nudist dip in Lake Minnetonka prescribed to Apollonia during Purple Rain, the purification ritual on offer here is no joke.\"],[22341,\"Christa Päffgen—the singer, songwriter, actress, poet, model, and proto-goth icon known as Nico—died in 1988 on a grassy mountain road in Ibiza, on a bicycle ride into a nearby town to buy weed. After an accident, she died of a massive brain hemorrhage. It’s the type of event that spurs reflection on the nature of mortality. And now it has inspired a dense new work by New York and Berlin-based electronic group Soundwalk Collective, featuring vocals by Patti Smith, and found and self-constructed percussion from her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith.To create field recordings, Soundwalk’s Stephan Crasneanscki, Simone Merli, and Kamran Sadeghi actually visited Ibiza, which is not particularly surprising. The group is known for finding the sounds they use the hard way; a 2012 work took them on a journey through the Amazon to collect source material from Peruvian shamans, for example. Their uncanny, intimate naturescapes on Killer Road create a sense of reality heightened enough to come back around to seeming artificial. Their source material—rustling tall grass, birds clustering and bickering in the trees, flies beginning to swarm, crickets humming—are smudged with delay, reverb, and crackling overdrive. The effect is the aural equivalent of a hazy, mirage-like film flashback. It feels like an appropriate methodology for a work which is attempting to re-enact a lost moment—to create something living and mutable from hearsay and police reports.If it’s not already apparent, this is, in no way, a covers album or even standard-issue “tribute,” to its great credit. Patti detaches Nico’s poems—the reason the German actress became involved in music in the first place—from their original musical settings. The words are sourced from throughout Nico’s discography, from 1968’s formative The Marble Index to two potent texts off her final, industrial-tinged album, 1985’s Camera Obscura. “Fearfully in Danger” is the only moment where Smith slips into full-bodied song, but even then, her melody is not Nico’s. Her vocals—glottal, pitchy, with an assertive, bluesy twang—are swallowed up by the album’s fitting centerpiece: a long blare from Nico’s own trademark harmonium. (The instrument was the first direct connection between Smith and Nico: Smith rescued it from on a pawn shop in 1978).In a 2013 interview discussing the forthcoming Killer Road, Smith pinpointed the common theme she senses in Nico’s writing, and what appealed to her about the project: the focus on the idea of “the inner voice.” There are, throughout this work, dominant phrases—“A true story wants to be mine\\/The story is telling a true lie,” “The honesty that lies to you,” “The hours since I saw you last\\/Have left me in an unknown past”—which suggest that the narrator’s deepest feelings and impressions are often not manifested in direct thought. Rather, they emanate in unpredictable, often destructive ways. In murder ballad “My Heart Is Empty,” Nico’s narrator and victim maintain a relationship of surface-level declarations, before the former’s true feelings arise in one culminating, brutal act. The rumbling drone chording of Soundwalk’s modular synth arsenal boils over, threatening to drown everything out. Smith compellingly exploits the peculiarities of her larynx, sliding between a sibilant whisper and quiet, foreboding speech as the narrator’s thoughts flit in and out of clarity.It’s moments like these that work best, when the project ceases to be what many news headlines framed it as—Patti Smith reciting Nico poems over ambient music—and becomes a unified piece, where every part interacts with the text in a meaningful, just-less-than-literal way. The effect can be sonically absorbing, if not as emotionally compelling as its creators might have hoped. It comes across like a chilling ASMR experiment mixed with something by Robert Ashley or Steven “Jesse” Bernstein. When Smith detaches from the scenery (“Fearfully in Danger,” the gothic nursery rhyming of “I Will Be Seven,” the more straightforward “My Only Child”) the effect is more similar to Nico’s own vocal performances, but makes for less cohesive music overall. One can imagine the project’s subject would have ultimately preferred the more understated tracks, concerted in their muted menace—focused on the task of creating a cinematic impression of the unknowable.\"],[22271,\"For Polish jazz great Michael Urbaniak, pinpointing a phase in his career as “noteworthy” is basically an act of omission. Hone in on his work as a composer, and it overlooks his genre-bending work as a player, particularly a violinist. Play up his time as a bandleader, and you understate his work as a sideman piercing through the gloss of Miles Davis’ electro-dub Tutu oddity “Don’t Lose Your Mind.” Emphasize his ’70s-and-onward contributions to fusion, and you downplay his role in helping give European jazz its own distinct style, including his time spent in the early ’60s playing saxophone for Krzysztof Komeda’s Quintet. But hailing Urbaniak would also be impossible without mentioning his collaborator and wife Urszula Dudziak, whose voice could go from the most velvety thing you’ve ever heard to a vocal run more warped than any analog synthesizer could make.Urbaniak and Dudziak’s stretch of albums in the ’70s and early ’80s, especially once they moved from Poland to New York in 1973, remain favorites among the more adventurous jazz heads and beat-diggers haunting the vinyl depths. (Urbaniak’s 1974 Fusion and Dudziak’s 1979 Future Talk are good places for the uninitiated to start.) But it was an album cut from a one-off LP that captured a particular corner of the music-geek imagination for more than 40 years: “Rien Ne Va Plus,” from the self-titled 1975 album by a sextet Urbaniak called Funk Factory, had its reckoning with the canon when the Dust Brothers sampled major chunks of it for Beastie Boys’ “Car Thief.” Even separated from that hip-hop context, where it clicked seamlessly with a guitar loop from the Jackson 5’s version of Funkadelic’s “I’ll Bet You,” “Rien Ne Va Plus” is a banger, all post-Head Hunters springy synth-bass and Dudziak lending her range to a sweet and untethered performance.As for the rest of the album, the Soul Jazz label tries to make a case for its place in the Urbaniak\\/Dudziak discography. “As Sampled By...” can make a record popular, but the rest of the album is far more eccentric than its most notorious cut could hint at. There’s a certain push-pull between the fusion of Urbaniak and his Poland-sourced players—including Bernard Kafka of the Komeda-contemporary vocal ensemble Novi Singers, along with synth player Wlodek Gulgowski—and the rotating American session-player rhythm section. Calling that latter contingent a who’s who of studio workhorses is an understatement: Anthony Jackson was at that point best known for the bassline to the O’Jays’ “For the Love of Money,” Steve Gadd’s other notable circa-1975 gigs include the rhythms for Van McCoy’s “The Hustle” and Paul Simon’s “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,” Gerry Brown would be the drummer on Stanley Clarke’s electric jazz-bass-redefining School Days, and Tony Levin would Chapman-Stick his way into prominent roles in Peter Gabriel’s band and the early ’80s post-hiatus King Crimson. But while the rhythm section holds it down—unobtrusively on ballads like the slightly-too-saccharine “The Music in Me,” or with flare on the uptempo “Horsing Around” and “Sinkin’ Low”—it’s the compositional flourishes of the Polish contingent that both mess with and build on fusion’s more upbeat side. The melodies push songs close to the fusion equivalent of sunshine pop, especially on cuts like “Watusi Dance” and “Next Please” where Dudziak and Kafka trade mostly-wordless voices, at which point they’re subsumed into Urbaniak’s electric violin and Gulgowski’s synths to create some spectacular mutant harmonies. Funk Factory can stray pretty far into the cheerier excesses of prog-jazz, but in a year where Thundercat can find sincere beauty in Fisher-Price Steely Dan, it’s hardly a dealbreaker. It emphasizes the alluring strangeness of its more experimental moments, like the hallucinogenic haunted-house tour of “Lilliput” or the banshee James Brown vocal riffs on “Horsing Around.” “Rien Ne Va Plus” remains the top highlight, every bit the equal as the best cut on any contemporaneous LaBelle album. But Funk Factory is more than just a notch in the belt of Paul’s Boutique—it’s proof that a core of musicians schooled in jazz but culturally steeped in the folk and classical traditions of Eastern Europe could, at least once, put out something that fit well with the crossover sound of the times while being unafraid to dive into freeform weirdness.\"],[22319,\"Picture yourself this past weekend at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. You kicked off Friday night by celebrating Brody Jenner’s birthday at Avalon and then made a preemptive strike against a Patron-induced hangover at Bow & Arrow Sports Bar with some Philly Cheesesteak Egg Rolls dipped in chipotle ketchup. Maybe you had a lucky streak at the slots on Saturday afternoon and blew your winnings at Yankee Candle before an afternoon nap and a chance to see Black Sabbath as part of their “farewell, for real this time” End Tour. And to cap it all off, you watched 75% of Rage Against the Machine, Public Enemy’s Chuck D, and Cypress Hill’s B-Real do rap-metal retoolings of “Shut ‘em Down” and “Killing in the Name,” getting a chance to scream, “Fuck you I won’t do what you tell me!” with 10,000 others in Sun Arena before slumping back to work on Monday.It does make Prophets of Rage come off as five guys turning some of the most incendiary music to ever hit the radio into a crass if not harmless nostalgia trip, so why not make some “more like profits of rage, amirite?” jokes and file it next to the CBGB Lounge and Bar in the Newark Airport, and the $225 Unknown Pleasures T-shirt at Barney’s? Because this would be a grave misunderstanding of Prophets of Rage. “Dangerous times demand dangerous songs,” their website declares, an admirable statement if Tom Morello had any new rage directed at any new machines that have arisen since his band’s 1992 debut. But despite pop music being politically weaponized to a degree unseen since the ’70s, it’s painfully clear that Prophets of Rage believe they alone can fix it. Their shockingly flimsy EP The Party’s Over risks nothing and hangs nobody. They’re either ignoring the past 23 years or even worse, they have nothing at all to say about it.A generous reading of The Party’s Over—four reworks of the collective’s best-known songs and a barely-there title track—shows the timelessness of Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine’s earliest works, music that felt truly dangerous when it bum-rushed MTV with Aerosmith and Meat Loaf videos still in heavy rotation. The systemic pathologies that inspired It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back and Fear of a Black Planet are still very much intact, and while Rage Against the Machine soundtracked more chest days than May Days, their visceral impact is still undeniable. These inflammatory times grant Prophets of Rage a tremendous opportunity to use their material as proxies for new discussions. “911 is a Joke” could be extended to implicate the utter failure of public services in the neighborhoods where they're needed the most; “Night of the Living Baseheads” might be reconfigured to tackle new forms of misunderstood drug addiction and price gouging; and what would be better than a Rage-style rework of “She Watch Channel Zero?!” a song that already samples Slayer?But none of this would likely fly at Barclay’s Center, BB&T Pavilion, EagleBank Arena or any of the other monuments to financial oligarchy in which the band currently performs. On what essentially serves as tour promo, Prophets of Rage shut up and play the hits: The Rage songs don’t rage against any specific machine and the Public Enemy songs could pass for Rage songs. The title track and “Shut ‘em Down,” now fused with variations on “Guerrilla Radio,” could just as easily be shouting the praises of the Denver Broncos’ defensive line as shouting down Nike’s lack of investment in black neighborhoods. And while the black militant theater of the S1Ws and the Bomb Squad’s production conveyed a sense of clear and present danger to white America, they’ve been replaced by Dave Grohl giving the Black Power sign in a full-band portrait and Morello doing his “no keyboards, ma” routine. Two decades on, the once innovative guitarist becomes the sound of teens safely working out their angst in suburban garages.The Party’s Over is unlistenable to anyone who has a meaningful relationship with the originals, either due to the suspect politics of Prophets of Rage, or the fact that they’re simply a bad cover band playing songs they actually wrote. Since it’s essentially the same format as Audioslave, one would assume Prophets of Rage would be superior to Audioslave on account of not being Audioslave. Whatever your opinions on the merits of “Cochise” compared to “Fight the Power,” Chris Cornell is more suited to the strengths of Rage’s rhythm section than Chuck D, B-Real or basically any rapper who isn’t Zach de la Rocha. While DJ Muggs and the Bomb Squad made memorable use of metal, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill’s music always came back to funk. Rage Against the Machine could never groove worth shit and everything here is subject to the same militaristic plod and pentatonic riffs that would actually make Prophets of Rage a pretty convincing Lex Luger cover band.As such, Chuck and B-Real are both overworked and unchallenged, straining like people trying to jog as slowly as possible. Not even taking the shoddy recording of the live tracks into account, the bigger issue is that Chuck D raps like de la Rocha’s simplified sloganeering is beneath him, which it is. Meanwhile, at some point, B-Real figures he’s supposed to take on the Flavor Flav role and can’t seem to decide what to make of the situation. He makes a game attempt to slightly revise the second verse of “Killing in the Name” (“Some of those up in Congress\\/Are the same that burn crosses”), but mostly sounds uninterested in making another rap-metal album 16 years after his last one. No one sounds like they’re having any fun here—Chuck and B-Real can’t even muster a convincing “Motherfucker!” at the end of “Killing in the Name.”The bigger issue is that while Morello claims, “We’ve come back to remind everyone what raging against the machine really means,” The Party’s Over has nothing to say about Black Lives Matter, Freddie Gray, Trayvon Martin, subprime loans, North Carolina law HB 2, continuing bloodshed in Chicago, or even Donald Trump (indications suggest their live show is no more revealing of their actual platform). The title track makes passing reference to the Illuminati and war machines and that's the only thing they've written in the 21st century. And while “No Sleep Til Cleveland” is indeed a “Fight the Power”\\/Beastie Boys mashup performed at the Republican National Convention, they didn’t even bother to change the actual hook to “no sleep til Cleveland.” Mind you, that’s a Beastie Boys song from their Licensed to Ill days about drinking and fucking anything that moves while on tour—weirdly apt in this setting, seeing as how there’s far more “Fight For Your Right to Party” than “Party For Your Right to Fight” in Prophets of Rage. Consider that AWOLNATION is, for some reason, their opening act on their “Make America Rage Again Tour,” a meme so played out that the band Filter got to it first. But even if the message of Prophets of Rage is vastly different than Donald Trump’s, they’re engaging in the same exact form of communication—wielding both bullhorn and a dog whistle, yelling as loudly as possible only to people who are predisposed to hear it.\"],[22331,\"Brian Wilson wasn’t born a pop Zeus, suffused with orchestral grandeur and full “teenage symphonies to God” in his head—he was once a gawky, deferential teen who sang a terrible song about a doll. It helps temper the decades-long fetishization of his genius and makes Becoming the Beach Boys: The Complete Hite & Dorinda Morgan Sessions, the rough audio of their earliest studio hours, a refreshing listen. It acknowledges how very far Wilson and his bandmates began from the gorgeous harmonies and slick pop songwriting that made their fame, and serves as a reminder that even if we admire artists who seem youthfully irrepressible, we’re often coming in at their 10,001st hour.The Morgan sessions, recorded in 1961-62, find the young Beach Boys (ages 15 to 20) floating their first material in the Hollywood home of producers Hite and Dorinda Morgan. Instead of whirling around the studio playing maestro and directing orders, in a take of his sonorous ballad “Surfer Girl,” Wilson meekly asks to overdub his bass (Hite Morgan barks back, “No,” and the matter is closed). The rest of Becoming the Beach Boys falls in line with this moment, a minutely parceled collection of occasionally insightful false starts and hesitancies. Its nine songs span 63 tracks, many under a minute and punctuated by tape skips, giggles, even the odd admission of burping. (The culprit is never identified but sounds like it could be Dennis Wilson, undersung singer\\/songwriter behind the group’s gorgeous “Forever.”) Forty-five of these pre-Capitol Records cuts were previously unissued; the rest appearing on such long-forgotten cobblings as The Beach Boys’ Biggest Beach Hits, released in 1969, and Lost & Found 1961-62, released in 1991.Remarkably, for the first material the Beach Boys ever attempted, three of these tracks would become huge hits—the chipper “Surfin’” and “Surfin’ Safari,” then, a year later, “Surfer Girl.” The first stabs of these are boisterous: “Surfin’” lurches out of the gate, its demo skittish with those now-familiar doo-wop bass vocals. Carl, Dennis, and Brian Wilson’s harmonies are tinnier with a twinge of stuck-chin bravado, even through the rather unconvincing insistence that “We’ll do the Surfer Stomp\\/It’s the latest dance craze.” (The cloddish move was a real, short-lived trend in the Boys' native Hawthorne.)Two years before Wilson’s production debut on “Surfer Girl,” in which he nurtured its luxurious harmonies and added the iconic falsetto top note, the song makes a halting introduction here in chord progressions more minor and morose. “Surfin’ Safari” is led confidently by Mike Love, with shades of the nasal tones he would later refine and popularize, even while his noncommittal placeholder mumbling veers towards “Flight of the Conchords” in the third and fourth takes.Six songs here never made the Boys’ studio output, and rightfully so. They range from “Beach Boy Stomp (aka Karate),” a surf-rock instrumental à la Dick Dale and the Surfaris, which sounds like a sandy spoof on the Champs’ hit “Tequila,” to the swingy pop ditty “Judy.” The master version of the latter features some of the most indicative hints of the band’s vocal promise, liquid tenor topping a sturdy bass. The song’s namesake was Judy Bowles, Brian Wilson’s first serious girlfriend. In his forthcoming memoir, I Am Brian Wilson, he recalls her fondly but also unearths an old vendetta with Mike Love for trying to dance with her. This would not be the last time Love would encroach on his turf.“Barbie,” a schmaltzy teenybopper ballad, rings as it was: writer Dorinda Morgan’s attempt to capitalize on a trendy new plastic doll. Even the Scotch 111 tape it’s recorded on seems to disdain this slavish, sluggish praise of “Barbie, Barbie, queen of the prom\\/Turned down dates with Eddie and Tom”—two of the takes are thwarted by skipping and scrambling effects. The unsettling ragtime piano jaunt “What Is a Young Girl Made Of” sounds like the soundtrack to a Woody Allen fever dream; incongruous in its tetchy delivery by Brian Wilson, it scarcely improves over seven more attempts.The Beach Boys have varied in lineup over the past 20 years—sporadically with Brian Wilson, usually under the pallid and reliably dickish thumb of Mike Love—but their camp has been constant in its steady stream of ‘60s material reissues and compilations, ranging from seismic to “at least Dad’s Christmas present is sorted.” Becoming the Beach Boys is, true to the name of the label that dispatched it, a curio for those who have heard the band’s full works and wish to gorge further on the scant unexplored crumbs of their history—or for those who collect Barbies.\"],[22325,\"After completing his A-levels and graduating from secondary school at 17, Jon Hopkins joined Imogen Heap’s band as a keyboard player. He played with them for about a year and was on his way to becoming a bit of a nomad, moving from project to project, slowly developing his voice. He garnered pockets of attention in the latter half of the ’00s for his work in film, particularly with Brian Eno on Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones, but his solo work was second to that of his film scores. It took him four albums before he hit the mark with Immunity, a relentlessly brooding and stark collection of songs. Immunity invented a visceral electronic world, decidedly claustrophobic and blindingly loud. His music took years to find this sensibility, and in his debut Opalescent, he was prone to mistakes that seem rather curious in the light of his recent work. He released Opalescent in 2001 when he was barely 22 years old, and it remains a strange record of Hopkins’ own youthful dalliances. To commemorate the long, circuitous journey Hopkins took to prominence, Just Music has reissued the album to celebrate its 15th anniversary. Opalescent was generally well-received at the time of its release. User reviews from Amazon dating back to 2001 tell a small story of ecstatic reception. One reviewer said they became obsessed with one of the tracks after hearing it on a new age sampler, which should give you a sense of where the album could be categorized. It’s classic chill-out music, the kind of stuff that came free with Windows XP, perfectly wrought for early visualizer technology. Opalescent is quite forcefully an extremely milquetoast album of vibes, filled with cheesy guitars and saccharine synthesizer flourishes. Other than the amount of time since its initial release, it is a bizarre choice for a deluxe reissue that hardly speaks to Hopkin’s current aesthetic sensibility. Why reissue this album in the first place?Standing at almost an hour, Opalescent is a bit of a slog. It starts inauspiciously with “Elegiac,” a mishmash of acoustic guitar plucks and computer start-up chimes. It sets the tone for the album—a tone similar to that heard in American malls circa 2001 during the heyday of Sharper Image. Hopkins’ songs are sleek, smooth, but lifeless—essentially simulations of emotional and meditative experience as opposed to something actually trance-inducing. “Halcyon” is shudderingly cheesy, a mess of mellow electric guitar and synth that brings up all the polite snark of a Dyson vacuum cleaner commercial. “Apparition” contains looped piano chords and ambient sputter that are so bland as to be anonymous. “Cold Out There,” one of the album’s highlights, is at least hesitant, impressionistic, and works on some fundamental level. Yet it’s not like you forget that you’re listening to music, it’s that it feels like that you've been on hold with a customer service representative for an entire hour. The album, while well-produced, becomes akin to muzak. Songs from Opalescent were also featured heavily in the last season of “Sex and the City.” Incidentally, the final season of the show is also the one that has aged the most poorly. Is it any surprise that prominence of Opalescent in late “Sex and the City” soundtracks coincided with the emergence of one of the shows more maligned and ridiculous characters: the cheesy artist, Aleksandr Petrovsky? Hopkins’ music was used during several key dramatic sequences during the last season: “Halcyon” appeared in “Let There Be Light” to introduce Carrie and Aleksander’s blooming relationship, “Cold Out There” soundtracked their breakup in the series finale. The early-career “Sex and the City” bump helped fund his later and better work, and it is a strangely appropriate footnote for the album. It became a means to an end, more than an actual piece of art Hopkins might think fondly of now. In an interview with Red Bull a few years ago, Hopkins said of the album, “I like about half of it now … I wish I could remove them from history. I was young and the best thing that came from it was that it managed to set me up to write the second one, because I earned a bit of money.” And that would seem to be that. A decade later, he would become a permanent fixture in electronic music. But in Opalescent we can see that rough drafts, even the one’s we let the world see, are blind to the future. Why Opalescent is getting a reissue if Hopkins himself said he would literally like to remove it from history is a confounding question. If anything, it offers a more coherent and detailed portrait of Hopkins’ progression. It is a moment of youthful fallibility, but one of the most extreme proofs of artistic growth. \"],[22320,\"Age, according to conventional wisdom, is supposed to bring some measure of contentment. Edges have been worn off, battles have been won (or forfeited), and the prickly dissatisfaction of youth has given way to a philosophical cultivation of stability. Real life seldom turns out that way, of course. But with age, our impulse to see everything as an all-or-nothing binary means real life’s messy mix of war and peace becomes, at least, embraceable. It’s a familiar perspective for the Dead C. Formed thirty years ago in Dunedin, New Zealand, the trio of Bruce Russell, Michael Morley, and Robbie Yeats has spent the overwhelming majority of their lives carving a cruel, transcendent path through the tangle of the noise-rock underground. Sometimes corrosive, sometimes constructive, the band’s output has remained as steady as it is volatile.Trouble is the Dead C’s first full-length since 2013’s Armed Courage, and while the band has only aged three years since then, the accumulated weight of decades is everywhere. That weight, though, is no hindrance. Instead, it’s wielded like an industrial machine on “One,” the first of the album’s five, number-titled tracks. Extrusions of static and microaggressive twitches of dissonance, courtesy of the guitars of Russell and Morley, dot a minefield rife with Yeats’ percussive skitter. Halfway through its twenty-minute sprawl, the song splits open just wide enough to hear Morley’s ghost-moaned vocals, a sound halfway between a mumble and a hymn. Similarly long, “Four” is more taut—a strangulated barrage of wah-pedal feedback washed in jazzy, impressionistic cymbal-work. As it picks up steam, it collapses spectacularly under its own mass.Though Trouble is nimble and fluid, the Dead C draw mainly on the gravity of their years. There’s a mournful air to “Two” after the opening drumbeat crawls to a momentary halt. The guitars helix around a sour melody, curling in the empty space where something used to be. Here, the album’s utilitarian non-titles make sense, as if to avoid conferring any context or intent. Likewise, a vague sense of loss howls through “Three,” which is also the record’s only true interval of fragility; the ten-minute middle of the song lapses into unhinged, human-like cries of confusion, weariness, surrender, and ultimately rage. It’s an uncanny-valley effect that captures a primordial eeriness, ancient and unsettling. “I think of myself as the Jimi Hendrix of no technique,” Russell told Wire in a 2013 interview. As self-deprecating as he was, his offhand comment is as true now as it was then. And it applies to the Dead C as a whole. At just over five minutes, “Four” is the briefest track on Trouble, but it’s also the album’s heaviest and most conventionally accessible. Motifs, if not outright riffs, abound; the song’s play of rhythm, texture, and dynamic borders on the metallic. It’s enough to make you imagine the Dead C, men in their fifties, embarking on a new career as a doom band. Not that they’d need to. With Trouble, Russell, Morley, and Yeats have dug one foot deeper into the thick, sludgy, noise-strewn topsoil they’ve long called home. Call it a trench, if you will, but it isn’t is a grave.\"],[22296,\"Lest you worry that critical acclaim and fame have brightened his outlook, Vince Staples opens the Prima Donna EP with a grainy recording of him singing “This Little Light of Mine,” cut short by the sound of a gunshot. Staples barely mumbles the song under his breath, making you lean in close to the speaker; the gunshot that punctuates the track might make you jump out of your seat. This intro provides a handy metaphor for how Staples operates as an artist: He draws you in with vital music, then hits you with the ugly reality. He’s clear on at least this much from the outset on Prima Donna—if you’re here for an uplift, you’ve come to the wrong place.On his debut full-length, Summertime ’06, Staples proved that he was not just a great rapper but a great album artist, crafting an immersive sound that transcended its production credits. Despite the impressive array of producers who worked on the album (No I.D., Clams Casino, DJ Dahi, Mikky Ekko), Summertime’s feel was uniform, a creaky, humid canvas on which Staples painted his morally ambiguous street tales. Still, while Staples might have just cemented his aesthetic, he’s already looking beyond it. Far from an effortless victory lap, Prima Donna finds the rapper veering off in a number of different directions in search of new sounds to bend to his will.No I.D. and DJ Dahi return to produce the bulk of Prima Donna’s tracks, though their mandate this time around seems to be sonic experimentation. “Smile” is practically a rap-rock song: fuzzed-out bass, a steady guitar upstroke, an unapologetic solo in its midsection. “Pimp Hand” sounds like a heart monitor wired up to a trunk full of muffled subwoofers. “Loco” matches Staples’ breathless narration of his descent into madness with shrill glissandos; more importantly, it contains some of the EP’s most richly evocative lyrics (“I’m in the black Benz speeding with my black skin gleaming” is a whole poem in a single line).As much as No I.D. and Dahi push past their own boundaries here, Prima Donna’s two most adventurous beats come courtesy of James Blake. While the English musician has occasionally flashed a deft hand as a hip-hop producer, we’ve never heard anything quite like these instrumentals from him. “Big Time” sounds both airy and dense, cobbling together Atari buzzes, snares that sound like money counters, and stray whirring noises. Atop all of this, Blake slowly piles up layers of skittering drum tracks until the whole thing wobbles like a Jenga tower. Staples raps furiously atop this beat, sketching out a dark counterpoint to Drake’s carefree YOLO meme (“You never know when you gon’ catch a case\\/Never know when you gon’ catch an eye”) before a plaintive chiptune melody creeps in.And then there’s “War Ready,” the EP’s strongest cut and one of the most striking songs either man has had a hand in. Blake kicks off the track by flipping a chopped up sample of André 3000’s final bars from “ATLiens” over a bed of bubbling sounds. The song then segues to a skeletal arrangement that consists of little more than a single synth line laid over a steady click-clack beat—an instrumental so sparse it makes the Neptunes sound like maximalists. All the better, though, to fully appreciate Staples’ lyrics, which are as devastating here as they’ve ever been. Expanding on an idea from his Clams Casino collaboration “All Nite” (“My people ready for war”), Staples reaches back into the history of oppression to draw parallels with the present: “County jail bus, slave ship, same shit\\/A wise man once said\\/That a black man better off dead\\/So I’m war ready”. When he delivers the line, “Turned the African into the nigga then they hung him,” it lands with the same impact as that gunshot in the intro.Hopelessness has always been a throughline in Staples work but Prima Donna puts a finer point on that feeling, both in its songs and interstitial spoken word bits. Staples repeatedly tells us that he’s fed up, he’s tired, he feels like giving up. And can you blame him, an artist who has spent his career cataloging the brokenness around him? On Summertime, Staples studied his own city as a microcosm of America, but here he zooms out even further, inviting you to see the bigger picture. At his best, Vince Staples is an artist who stares hard truths dead in the eye. On Prima Donna, he dares us to do the same.\"],[22243,\"Perhaps it was only a matter of time until Crystal Castles redirected the anger they once reserved for the rest of the world toward each other. After singer Alice Glass quit the band due to \\\\\"reasons both professional and personal,\\\\\" she announced her intentions to go solo. Producer Ethan Kath fired back with a statement containing all the sensitivity of a Donald Trump tweet. “i think it can be empowering for her to be in charge of her own project,” he wrote. “it should be rewarding for her considering she didn’t appear on Crystal Castles’ best-known songs.” Then, for posterity, he listed more than a dozen of those songs. “people often gave her credit for my lyrics and that was fine, i didn’t care.” Clearly, he kind of did.Just the mere act of continuing Crystal Castles seemed distasteful to many fans who’d assumed, as Glass had written, that her departure meant the end of the project. But Kath didn’t just replace Glass; he tried to scrub her from the band’s legacy. While it may be true that Glass was never the driving force behind Crystal Castles’ sound, on stage she was their star attraction, the group’s spiritual link to the punk community and the wild card that made their shows such a frightening spectacle (she always appeared on the cusp of coming to blows with anybody within reach). To many, she was the group, yet the band’s current press material doesn’t make so much as a single mention of her. Never mind that she’s pictured right there on the cover of their first album, or that her name adorns one of their signature songs; in Kath’s revisionist history of Crystal Castles, she made no meaningful contributions.So Kath’s first Glass-less Crystal Castles album, Amnesty (I), arrives under uncomfortable circumstances. Its cover certainly doesn’t make it feel any less gross. (Is that photo of several nearly identical girls intended as commentary on how easily Kath believes women can be replaced?) Even the presumptuous (I) affixed to the title could be interpreted as a taunt, a sort of “there’s more to come” for anybody questioning the legitimacy of his new lineup.But Kath’s never seemed too concerned about being cast as a villain; bad press has trailed the group since its earliest days. As he attempts to make the case that Crystal Castles was his project all along, the new music does a better job bolstering his claims than any written statement ever could. Amnesty never tops what came before, but its best moments come impressively close. Even though the band’s hostile electro-industrial fusion is less of a novelty than it was in 2008, nobody else is producing it quite like this, and Kath’s incinerating hellscapes are as jolting and tactfully concise as ever. He owns this sound.Of course, once again, Kath owes his success in part to a strong collaborator. Inheriting the unenviable task of replacing one of the most singular frontwomen of the last decade, and under such tumultuous circumstances, new recruit Edith Frances proves more than capable. Though she lacks Glass’ violent temperament and scorched-earth conviction, she possesses a more controlled, refined voice that shines on Amnesty’s dreamier tracks, particularly “Char,” the most openly emotional pop song Crystal Castles has ever done. Her lavender soprano just barely brushes against the rotted-out trap beat of “Sadist,” and it’s so outmatched by the raved-up synths of closer “Their Kindness Is Charade” that the effect is heartbreaking.Too often, though, Amnesty doesn’t give her the freedom to put much of her own stamp on the material. With its ghostly shrieks, “Frail” is so closely patterned after the old Crystal Castles playbook that many people assumed it was a leftover from the Glass era when Kath first shared it. The convulsing “Enth” feels similarly like the product of a time capsule. It’s as if Kath went out of his way to keep recording songs that sound just like the ones he did with Glass.And so as good as it often is, Amnesty feels like a missed opportunity, the first safe album from an act that once would have recoiled at such a thought. It could have played into the strengths of the band’s enigmatic new singer, embracing the more nuanced identity she could bring to the project. Instead, Frances and Kath evoke earlier iterations of Crystal Castles, where they could have moved forward. Fans can debate whether that’s disrespectful to Glass, but it doesn’t do the current band any favors, either. You can’t take full advantage of a new chapter if you’re too stubborn to even acknowledge that it is a new chapter at all.\"],[22328,\"The New Yorker cartoonist Adrian Tomine was 17 when he started writing the comic “Optic Nerve.” Its early issues were later collected in a book called “32 Stories,” and for fans who had come to admire Tomine’s sharply written dialogue and distinctive style, those first works may have come as a surprise. Almost laughably amateurish, they gave lie to the idea that he had sprung from nowhere, a fully-formed comics genius. Instead they offered a chart tracking his artistic growth, and served as an inspiration to young artists despairing at their own sloppy work.There is a distinct pleasure in getting a glimpse at the scratchpad of a favorite artist, recognizing go-to techniques and little creative experiments in a less presentable guise. That’s the idea animating Water, a new release from Aaron Maine’s band Porches that collects six of the demos for songs from the winter 2016 release Pool. The record represented a transition for Maine, from the digitally enhanced rock and folk of his earlier Bandcamp releases to mournful indie pop powered by synths and drum machines. The demos on the cleverly-named Water, though impressive by the standards of most song sketches, lack the sophistication of the mixes on Pool, allowing committed fans a look at the sinew between the more bare-bones Porches projects and the muscle of the newer record.Maine has expressed enthusiasm about his recently developed production ability and the songs on Water suggest that his pride is well earned, demonstrating how he edited and improved his creations. Water’s version of the song “Pool” lacks the kick of the final cut, which is better paced, bringing in discreet instrumental flourishes one after the other. “Car,” on Pool, derives its power from the emotion built into its awed refrain, “Oh, what a machine.” The song is subdued on Water, its chorus less of a standout.But even as the songs on Water emphasize the relative strength of Pool, they carry listeners down a road not taken, one filled with its own attractions and surprises. The Water version of “Shaver” may not include the final version’s killer saxophone solo, but it almost makes up for it with a lovely organ progression reminiscent of some of the sounds on the 2011 Porches record Summer of Ten. And of course, it’s not always so clear-cut which version of a song is “better.” For instance, the production on Pool’s version of “Mood” is crisper, but the verses on the Water version seem to be sung more sweetly. There are plenty of other examples where the rough version of a particular song includes an element that I wish had made it to the final cut.Water also features two new unreleased tracks, “Black Dress” and “Black Budweiser T-Shirt.” Neither feels anywhere close to finished; if anything, they feel less fully realized than the six demos. The video for “Black Dress,” however, features choreography from Emma Portner and Devonté Hynes, and is worth watching.When he was doing press for Pool, Maine said that he had worked hard to make the demos sound as good as he possibly could, and that work is obvious. The versions of the songs on Water have enough depth to make for a solid record in their own right. That Maine realized there was a whole separate layer of work still to be done on each song allowed him to make the best album of his career. This is an instructive example of artistic maturity in process, one which makes Water more than just a vanity project. Instead, it’s a demonstration of what it takes to tweak a song, upgrading an intriguing idea to the point where it’s nearly irresistible, where an artist comes into his own.\"],[22279,\"Nathan Bowles may be best known as a banjo player, but he’s not just a banjo player. Aside from playing drums, piano, and organ in Steve Gunn’s touring band as well as supporting roles in Pelt and Black Twig Pickers, Bowles’ solo albums cover a wide terrain. On 2014’s Nansemond, guitarist Tom Carter nearly stole the show. His solos helped bring Bowles’ compositions—which recall both early American folk and more contemporary revivalists like Jack Rose—to thornier and heavier places. Nansemond positioned Bowles as a crucial force in folk music, showcasing his ability to interweave the genre’s communal spirit with chilling moments of ambient introspection.The latter informs the most beautiful composition on Whole & Cloven, Bowles’ colorful, uplifting follow-up to Nansemond. Despite its on-the-nose title and extended runtime, the 11-minute “I Miss My Dog” is an exercise in subtlety, a gorgeous and impeccably paced elegy. Its slow-building structure touches on the darkness within Nansemond, but the song ascends with a feathery rhythm that serves as the album’s heartbeat. Remarkably, it uses traditional folk elements and instrumentation to reach something closer to New Age music.In a recent interview, Bowles explained his attraction to the banjo \\\\\"because it’s a drum with strings on it. I tend to play everything percussively.” He puts that sentiment into practice throughout his performances on Whole & Cloven. An earthy buzz created by an acoustic guitar echoes through the beatific “Words Spoken Aloud,” sounding at once like a jaw harp and a kazoo. The sunshower of keys in “Chiaroscuro,” meanwhile, suggests that he looks at the piano just like the banjo: an even bigger drum with strings on it. Playing all the instruments himself, Bowles transcends their primary sounds, reinventing them to better suit his compositions. Even his banjo playing, which is as rhythmic and virtuosic as always, more closely resembles a sitar in most songs. In “Gadarene Fugue,” the actual percussion flitters from his picking like sparks from a campfire.After using something like an entire music store’s worth of instruments, in “Moonshine Is the Sunshine,” as on several Nansemond tracks, we get to hear Bowles' actual voice. He sings exactly like you’d imagine a guy with a banjo to sing: a lazy, gravely holler that sells the obscure folk song’s “Wouldn’t it be funny if all the fish dropped out of school?” cutesiness. It’s one of the only tracks on the album that scans immediately as standard folk music: the kind of song a traditionalist like Sam Amidon might color with sadness, or Gillian Welch might stretch out into a cavernous ballad. But Bowles just plays it straight, stomping his foot, and bellowing along. It’s not his most revelatory performance, but it’s certainly his most joyful. On an album that reshapes folk music into something boundless and new, “Moonshine” is a testament to how far he’s come.\"],[22256,\"On the very first song on his very first record, Cass McCombs went to the hospital. There he received some troubling test results and found himself faced with an unanswerable question. “Is it dying that terrifies you,” he sang, in a gentle, boyish sigh that would earn him plenty of comparisons to Elliott Smith, “Or just being dead?” It was a heavy introduction, but, in its plainspoken intensity, it foretold the work to come. As McCombs’ music progressed from murky lo-fi to austere folk-rock, his on-record persona has evolved with it, becoming at once more fleshed-out and more mysterious. He’s in a strange position now of being a veteran songwriter who we’re just getting to know.On his last record, 2013’s double-album Big Wheel and Others, McCombs tried to show us everything. While it was his most ambitious album—ranging from apocalyptic ballads to sunny, crooner pop, with enough room to include a faithful Thin Lizzy cover—it was also his most unwieldy, an album as road-trip that was exhilarating and exhausting. Mangy Love takes the opposite approach, refining a career’s worth of ideas into his most focussed work yet, accomplishing what Big Wheel set out to do in about half the time. As expected from McCombs, Mangy Love is a uniformly cloudy work, but it’s his most revealing album, his most political, and his funniest yet. Across its twelve songs, McCombs dabbles in his deadpan surrealism, throws in a few well-placed toilet jokes, and even shares some of his Twitter drafts. “Netflix and die,” he scowls late in the album, “Go on and cry.”While McCombs’ career has been one of slow-building evolution (“Season of the slug\\/Crawling up the vine,” goes a line on “Medusa’s Outhouse”), Mangy Love’s first half feels something like a crash course through his last fifteen years of songwriting. The set opens with “Bum Bum Bum,” whose soulful, echoing guitars harken back to McCombs’ early work. But the lyrics express confusion and hopelessness in the current flashpoint of police brutality. “How long until this river of blood congeals,” McCombs asks repeatedly, punctuating each stanza with an exhausted “bum bum bum.” It’s one of the most powerful songs McCombs has ever written: a plea for peace, or maybe just to pay attention.Other tracks follow suit, expanding on McCombs' discography with a wider scope and greater confidence. “Medusa’s Outhouse” floats like a psychedelic smoke ring through Wit’s End’s wine-stained piano ballads, and “Low Flyin’ Bird” hums with a folksy flutter, recalling McCombs’ jammy detour on this year’s Skifflin’. These songs highlight McCombs’ keen pop sensibility that informed breakthrough moments like “You Saved My Life” and “County Line,” without forsaking any of his idiosyncrasies. The juxtaposition of the two are made immediately apparent amid the ’90s-Van Morrison jazz-pop of “Laughter Is the Best Medicine.” Guest vocalist Rev. Goat Carson slurs along with McCombs in almost-unison, his timing perfect, so as not to spoil the punchlines. “Sugar and spice,” they sing together, “And everything… weird.”It’s a classic McCombs trick, flipping cliches into his own weird vernacular. It’s also something of a mission statement for the album’s back half. Songs like “Run Sister Run” and “Switch” favor the groove over the hook, giving away their secrets in the first 60 seconds and mostly just riding those vibes before fading around the five-minute mark. While lacking the momentum and immediacy of the album’s first half, these songs showcase the dynamics of McCombs’ band and the impeccably smooth production from Elliott Smith-collaborator Rob Schnapf. Like Ariel Pink’s similarly expansive Pom Pom, Mangy Love is comfortable in its experimentation, maintaining a consistent, lived-in atmosphere throughout its separate halves. Ever resistant to traditional structures, however, McCombs imbues each side of the record with a track that deliberately disrupts the flow. “Rancid Girl,” an outtake-quality oddball placed in the confrontational spot of track two, loops a gnarly, bluesy riff while McCombs berates a 17-year-old (“You’re bad\\/I mean, you smell bad.”) Think of it as a symbolic sister to Neil Young’s “Stupid Girl,” the kind of character experiment that one might have expected McCombs to have outgrown by this point (which is probably exactly why he kept it on the album). On the opposite end of the spectrum is “It,” a late-album stunner that begins like the world’s saddest air conditioner booting up and climaxes with a choir of harmonies behind McCombs’ vocals. The song bursts out the speakers. “All of its life, wandering\\/All of mine, wondering,” he sings, a simple turn of phrase that reads like a reflection on the work he’s created: an ever-shifting body, with a restless brain behind it. But even if McCombs remains impossible to pin down, on Mangy Love, he’s never seemed more intent on making a connection.\"],[22340,\"The rapper-producer bond is at the center of rap symbiosis, but it’s a balance that’s difficult to maintain. Gucci Mane and Zaytoven have embodied that balance for over a decade now. It was Zaytoven who convinced Gucci to start rapping in his basement in the early 2000s, and the connection between the two was instantaneous: “Me and Gucci had a chemistry,” he told The Fader for their oral history of the storied street rapper. “Wherever he went or whoever he teamed up with, I was rocking with him.” The pair has been prolific, releasing hundreds of songs and forging modern trap music in their image. In addition to producing EA Sportscenter, which kickstarted Gucci’s strongest stretch in 2008, and appearing on several mixtapes throughout his career, Zaytoven is the only producer credited on all nine of Gucci’s studio albums. It isn’t an exaggeration to say they changed rap, in sound and disposition.But time changes everything, and the two aren’t the tag-team they once were. They’ve both strayed from their storied partnership in recent years, in part because of Gucci’s prison stint, but also just due to outright growth and progression. Zaytoven produced the middle work in Future’s rehabilitating mixtape trilogy, Beast Mode, along with hits like Migos’ breakout single “Versace,” and Gucci has worked with a host of producers including Mike WiLL Made-It and Metro Boomin, two guys heavily indebted to his influence who have gone on to shape the current rap landscape. Gucci and Zaytoven always existed outside of each other, but these days they’re no longer defined by it. Their latest joint EP, GucTiggy, is a salute to the decade-plus they’ve spent redefining rap and a testament to their fellowship. Gucci puts it plainly on “GucTiggy Vol. 3:” “Zay, that's my vato, yeah, yeah, that's my Preemo.”Likely recorded in the six days of sessions that created Everybody Looking, which was primarily produced by Zaytoven and Mike WiLL, GucTiggy is just as rushed as the album and even less polished. But this project isn’t meant to be some great, standalone work, an Everybody Looking companion piece, or even as an informal introduction to the upcoming Woptober project. It’s simply a token of a longstanding, working friendship. The production value is somewhat fitting, almost reminiscent of those early mixtapes that made them staples on the underground and Datpiff circuits. These songs are trinkets, collectibles for longtime fans and disposable Gucci-Zay ephemera for their rap scrapbook. If Everybody Looking was Gucci Mane and Zaytoven rediscovering their rhythm, this is their opportunity to smell the roses.Still, Gucci is shaking the prison rust off with every flow, working his way back into rapping shape, and even when he isn’t at his full power he’s a formidable presence. On “GucTiggy Vol. 2 (Woptober),” he chugs along steadily, letting his momentum build line by line. By “GucTiggy Vol. 4,” he’s capturing glints of past glory with gems like “I’m so Marilyn Manson, I’m so heinously handsome\\/I’m more dangerous than famous, I’ll take your grandson for ransom.” Zaytoven is about as dependable as they come, and he lines heavy 808 bass with prickly synths and accenting keys. Things are starting to come together, and on GucTiggy they build back a bit more of the chemistry lost to time served with each breath and keystroke. “I ain’t got not partners, I’m my own partner,” Gucci raps in the opening bar of “GucTiggy Vol. 1,” undoubtedly a swipe at a former comrade like Waka Flocka Flame. But such a bar overlooks his man behind the boards.\"],[22251,\"For This We Fought the Battle of the Ages—the fourth album by Salt Lake City doom-and-drama masters SubRosa—takes its inspiration from We, an almost 100-year-old dystopian novel by Russian writer Yevgeny Zamyatin. We is a paralyzing, prescient portrait of a modern surveillance state, where a world made of glass prevents secrets and state policies curtail pleasurable sex. We predates George Orwell’s Animal Farm and 1984 by two decades and helped shape a literary tradition where the chief concern is exactly how much state authority can overpower individual autonomy. It is a most relevant anxiety in 2016. But an hour-length album that lifts lines, themes, and arcs from an especially didactic framework? That may sound like a bit much.During the last decade, though, SubRosa has steadily learned to make the obscure accessible, to open up the high-volume lurch and heavy-menace scowl of doom to an ever-widening audience. Founder and leader Rebecca Vernon has woven threads of bewitching folk and magnetic grunge into her metal, an approach epitomized by 2013’s More Constant Than the Gods. Backed by a fleet of violins and a rhythm section that could quickly sink from featherweight to heavyweight, Vernon’s anthems pulled you into their oversized gothic churn. And on Battle of Ages—yet again, the best work of SubRosa’s career—she doubles down on the ability to make the esoteric compelling. This is grand, unapologetic doom metal that should also fit fans of symphonies, post-rock bands, and alt-rock radio. And this is writing so rich that it raises deep, pressing questions about our very existence with richly written scenes and sharply posed worries. You may want to press “pause” just to ponder, but the brooding, booming music demands you move onward.Four of Battle of Ages’ six songs break the 10-minute mark, with two lasting for a quarter-hour. These unabashed track lengths give SubRosa room to roam and the ability to fold a panoply of sounds and ideas into one space. “Black Majesty,” for instance, opens with Vernon singing a black widow’s lullaby (“Isn’t it good to be acquainted with darkness?” she begins) over crackling electronics. The song soon lunges forward, though: room-rattling drums cut beneath a low-slung riff before the whole band shifts into a double-time sprint, where screeching violins intensify the raw nerves of the rhythm section. There are strong hooks and soft harmonies, a section that feels like Cocteau Twins gauze and another that feels like Silver Mt. Zion-sized fury. And these are just accessories to lyrics where Vernon poignantly wonders about the redemption inherent in mortality and the error inevitable in myth. “We love the taste of false perfection\\/The more the lies, the more we laud,” she seethes amid a complicated bridge. The line pulls all her abstraction into a political moment where a reality television star sits near the brink of the presidency.Elsewhere, Vernon softly sings folk music in Italian over a plucked lyre. The band pits death metal barks against seraphic harmonies during “Wound of the Warden,” a 13-minute sprawl where the midsection could be a rock radio classic unto itself. “Troubled Cells” conjures a loneliness and despair so exquisite it might as well be a murder ballad, while the shout-along coda reimagines the Arcade Fire’s mix of gang vocals and strings with more interest in dark than light. It’s no small wonder that SubRosa’s most ambitious work, where songs last as long as television shows, doubles as its most compulsory listen. Both qualities stem from SubRosa’s command of so many styles and ability to hide the seams that stitch them together.Novelistic inspiration, turns out, suits SubRosa perfectly, as it matches the band’s scale, where big ideas about life, death, freedom, and love are emboldened by songs that pull in influences like a vortex. Sure, For This We Fought the Battle of the Ages shares themes and scenes with We, from which it, like Orwell did, lifts a worried vision for the future. More important, though, is that it shares the audacity to reimagine how the world looks or sounds. Zamyatin was an architect of what has become an idiom. And few doom bands operate with the urgency and inclusion of SubRosa, a group that’s made an album you can’t escape about a world you wish you could.\"],[22257,\"“Does the internet dream of itself?” asks Werner Herzog in his new film, Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World. If it does, that subliminal soundtrack might be something like Motion Graphics, the debut solo album from the New York electronic musician Joe Williams. Until now, Williams has been known best as a sideman; he lent his hand to the squirrelly electronic textures of Co La’s 2013 album Moody Coup, and he also plays in Lifted, Maxmillion Dunbar and Co La’s drift-loving beats-and-improv ensemble. Only now, with his debut album as Motion Graphics, does the musician step out on his own—although “step in” might be a better way of phrasing it, as Motion Graphics is an album largely about inner space, virtual reality, and the infinite expanses that unfold behind computer screens.You might guess as much from his alias, and it’s clear from his titles, too: “Minecraft Mosaic,” a tribute to the blocky world-building computer game, or “SoftBank Arcade,” which references the Japanese multinational telecom company. It’s also clear from his lyrics, which weave sticky semantic webs that join the natural world with its digital analog. In a cool, clear voice, he sings of rewiring leaves, of windows and screens, of birds-eye lenses flying overhead. “Heaven sent the GUI,” he sings in “Minecraft Mosaic.” In “City Links,” he muses, “Links accelerate\\/Rendering a time zone\\/Moving in a mobile home.” It seems likely those aren’t double-wides he’s talking about, but rather our own peripatetic second homes, as we scuttle about like hyperconnected hermit crabs living out of our phones.But this isn't an album about words; first and foremost, it is an album about sounds. And here, too, Williams’ digital preoccupations are self-evident. Motion Graphics’ palette glows with a vivid, hi-def sheen: faux-choral synthesizer pads and ethereal, new age tones; digital sound effects like birdsong and splashing water; hyperkinetic chimes and pings that mimic your computer's alerts. In Motion Graphics’ universe, a sound is rarely just a sound; it’s often an avatar for something else, too. Nimble hi-hats dance across the gleaming surface of his music like long-legged water striders, but they’re also obvious nods to contemporary hip-hop production, just as his fluttering, phasing clarinets and MIDI-driven Debussy runs invoke classical references.Those classical influences run deep: “Anyware”—a dynamic relay race of short, staccato phrases passed between marimba, clarinet, and sampler—nods to Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians, while the gorgeous, freeform “Forecast” dials up a forest clearing on the holodeck and pipes in an ersatz rendition of Astor Piazzolla’s tango nuevo for added atmosphere. It’s rare to encounter references to both DJ Mustard and Steve Reich in the same piece of music, but that’s presumably part of the point of Motion Graphics, an album inspired in part by the seamless (yet jarring) experience of the infinitely scrolling media feed.Though these kinds of themes might not seem terribly novel—James Ferraro broached many of them with Far Side Virtual, and legions of vaporwave musicians have continued to beat that dead electric horse since—Williams renders it all so vividly and so lovingly that it hardly matters. Listen to the complexity of a track like the pulse-minimalist “Anyware” or the footwork-tempo “SoftBank Arcade” and it becomes clear that he is a proper composer, not just a cut-and-paste artist. And Motion Graphics’ contradictions—simultaneously placid and disorienting, warm and chintzy, intimate and distant—make it a seductively unusual listening experience as warm as the surface of your laptop. There’s no irony here; Williams’ lucid machine dreaming is deeply felt. As vaporwave grows stale, his album offers a breath of fresh air.\"],[22132,\"In 1999, the Roots were in limbo. The Philadelphia hip-hop band had released three critically acclaimed albums but were still considered something of a novelty act, featuring a big guy with a big Afro on drums (?uestlove), a sharp but unshowy MC (Black Thought), two beatboxers (Rahzel and Scratch), and a stellar live show—all anomalies in the gilded age of Puff Daddy and the million-dollar sample clearance. The Roots had by this time amassed a faithful cult following, but none of it translated to mainstream success. They were selling more records and slowly moving beyond their dedicated base of jazz and traditional rap purists, but their career wasn’t headed anywhere in particular.Reflecting these tensions, the Roots opened their fourth studio album, Things Fall Apart, with dialogue from a scene from Spike Lee’s 1990 film, Mo’ Better Blues, in which characters Bleek Gilliam and Shadow Henderson—played by Denzel Washington and Wesley Snipes, respectively—debate the state of jazz music. Gilliam doesn’t want to sacrifice his creative vision to pander to crowds, and he thinks black people should come to his shows simply because he’s making black art. “That’s bullshit,” Henderson quips. “The people don’t come because you grandiose motherfuckers don’t play shit that they like.” The clip seemed to acknowledge the Roots’ reputation: They were too smart for their own good, too self-aware, and they were getting in their own way. It was as if, from the very beginning, the band sought to be misunderstood, to find somewhere to hide from the mainstream.As unique as the Roots were—they were a hip-hop band, after all—their music still had traces of what was popular at the time. Their 1995 album Do You Want More?!!!??! featured the sort of laid-back jazz feel that Digable Planets had perfected the year before on Blowout Comb. The Roots’ follow-up, 1996’s Illadelph Halflife, was more aggressive and confrontational, taking lyrical and sonic cues from the Wu-Tang Clan. But the group was searching for something different. Before the release of Things Fall Apart, they had positioned themselves as a sort of remedy for the excesses of Bad Boy’s empire, which in those days became an all-too-easy target for the backpacker set. In their satirical 1996 video for “What They Do,” the Roots mocked the sort of rap video stereotypes popularized by director Hype Williams, thumbing their collective nose at champagne bottles and mansion parties. Acts like the Roots wanted to give listeners the “real shit,” but while they and others criticized Bad Boy’s gravitational pull, their art-rap aesthetic was its own form of marketing. They just hadn’t figured out what they were selling. While the Roots thought of themselves as the anti-establishment alongside acts like OutKast and the Fugees, those groups sold millions of records when the Roots were struggling to go gold.By 1997, before the sessions for Things Fall Apart began, drummer and bandleader ?uestlove was exploring new opportunities beyond the Roots. He was more concerned with recording D’Angelo’s Voodoo and Common’s Like Water for Chocolate than he was with his own group. It wasn’t that he wanted to leave the Roots, but still, his outside projects created resentment amongst band members who questioned his focus. “In my head at that time, the notion of a Roots album was a distant third,” ?uest wrote in his 2013 memoir, Mo’ Meta Blues. He was spending time with Voodoo engineer Russell Elevado, learning new ways to manipulate sound to give his own music a more granular, less studied feel. He wanted to be a heralded producer like DJ Premier and J Dilla, but his band’s work felt remarkably clean—even sterile—in comparison. The best rap of that era had to feel at least a little gritty: Though the Notorious B.I.G. was signed to Bad Boy, his 1997 album Life After Death had plenty of dark, violent narratives. The Wu’s massive double album, Wu-Tang Forever, was full of woozy street bangers, courtesy of the group’s production team, with the RZA at the helm. Realizing he needed to improve as a producer, ?uest learned how to play drums “dirty,” taking Dilla’s lead and dragging his percussion just a bit to make the beat seem off-kilter.The genesis of Things Fall Apart can be traced back to a hangout ?uest had with Premier, Dilla, and D’Angelo, where he played them a rough version of a Roots song called “Double Trouble” and got disinterested head-nods in return. Determined to bolster the track, ?uest recorded drums to two-inch tape, looped it back through the soundboard, and tweaked the EQ to give it a feeling of distance. “It was a turning point in my understanding of my own career,” ?uest wrote in his memoir. “I knew that the other guys respected me as a drummer… but I also wanted them to respect me as a producer and a songwriter.” In its finished form, “Double Trouble” is arguably the centerpiece of Things Fall Apart; rapper Black Thought finally had a hard-charging instrumental to match his verbal dexterity, and guest Mos Def matched him bar-for-bar.Things Fall Apart is where the Roots figured out who they were—it wasn’t “just another Roots record,” and if the group was going to fail, they were going out their own way. “Table of Contents (Part 1)” illustrates their new willingness to take risks: The breakbeat is messy and the mix is intentionally pinched and lopsided, but the track’s feeling of chaos is an ideal table-setter, opening the record on a tense and uncertain note. On “Step Into the Realm,” the drum loop fades in and out, but the rhythmic instability makes the rappers’ audibly distorted vocals sound even more urgent. If the Roots’ first three albums mastered the meeting point between jazz and rap, this was the first time the band went psychedelic, opening up new possibilities sonically and lyrically.D’Angelo’s 1995 album Brown Sugar and Erykah Badu’s Baduizm from 1997 were the blueprint for new-school soul music, and Things Fall Apart applied those ideas to hip-hop proper. In this aesthetic space, artists with different approaches could find new ways to be creative together, and a new movement was being born. “You Got Me,” the lead single from Things Fall Apart, found a crooning Badu next to rapper Eve from the Ruff Ryders over a lilting guitar figure and strings. The classic arrangement and eclectic mix of voices, paired with ?uestlove’s typically propulsive and cutting backbeat, sounded both old and new, looking backwards and forwards simultaneously. The Roots were pushing the limits of their sound, establishing a lane for D’Angelo, Common, and Badu to do the same. By building a musical community and mastering the art of collaboration, they figured out how to cross over and keep their soul intact.Things Fall Apart was the Roots’ most successful record, and after years in the shadows, they were finally getting radio airplay and touring as headliners. The album went gold two months after its release and hit platinum in 2013. In addition to its commercial success, it served as a launching pad for new voices, like Roc-A-Fella rapper Beanie Sigel, who debuted as a guest artist on “Adrenaline!,” and Eve, whose “You Got Me” appearance was her most prominent feature at the time. The relatively unknown Jill Scott wrote the chorus for “You Got Me” and was slated to sing on the track until MCA Records pushed for a bigger name (Badu) to appear in her place; soon, Eve and Scott would release their own platinum-selling albums.Despite being a breakthrough for their band and their scene, the Roots didn’t immediately build on Things Fall Apart’s success. Powered by D’Angelo’s sultry “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” video, Voodoo became a phenomenon, and ?uest spent most of 2000 on tour as the singer’s drummer. By the time the Roots re-grouped, ?uest’s closest peers were pushing their sounds to new places. D wanted to learn guitar; Common and Dilla wanted to experiment with electronic textures. The Roots responded by moving away from the movement they helped create; their follow-up record, Phrenology, was essentially the anti-Roots album, with a heavy emphasis on rock. And while it alienated the Roots’ core fanbase, Phrenology performed well, pushing the group further into crossover territory. The Roots became a more regular presence on TV and radio. Soon after, Rahzel and Malik B. left the group for good. In 2006, Dilla died at age 32 from complications of lupus, and the Roots’ album of that year, Game Theory, kicked off a series of releases with a darker tone, including 2008’s Rising Down, 2010’s How I Got Over, and 2011’s undun. Having secured a gig as Jimmy Fallon’s backing band—first on “Late Night,” then on “The Tonight Show”—the Roots finally and completely entered the mainstream. But they used the freedom to experiment and make the music they wanted.Things go in cycles, and the approach the Roots pioneered came back around. In 2015, the “next movement” the Roots mentioned on Things Fall Apart seemed to arrive. Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly—a densely lyrical and allegorical exploration of Blackness and struggle, set to a live-jazz soundtrack featuring dozens of collaborators—is hard to imagine without this album in its rearview. Artists like Robert Glasper, Thundercat, Terrace Martin, and Kamasi Washington channel the same creativity as the Roots, D’Angelo, and company, banding together to push rap, jazz, soul, and more into atmospheric new places. The spirit of Things Fall Apart is in the air.Looking back on it now, this record feels like both a love letter and a fond farewell to the Roots’ early days, acknowledging that they needed to evolve to stay relevant. And some of the album’s continued relevance is painful. Its closing poem, “The Return to Innocence Lost,” details the fate of a young man seemingly doomed to fail since birth. He dies tragically, leaving nothing but thoughts of a life that could’ve been. Nowadays, black men are dying at the hands of police with alarming frequency, and we’re left to mourn the dead in hashtags and shared articles, wondering what’s next—or who’s next—in this seemingly endless war. Things Fall Apart imparts a similar tone, even if the band didn’t address those issues directly. The black and white cover art, taken in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn in 1965, depicts a young black woman running from a waiting police officer, her face twisted in fear. The scene is sadly familiar 50 years later. As the Roots teetered between fame and purgatory, virtue and failure, Things Fall Apart captured the intensity of a group with everything to lose and the world to gain.\"],[22254,\"Whenever Katy Goodman and Greta Morgan hang out, they dream big. After hiking past Los Angeles’ Griffith Observatory one night, the former Vivian Girl and Hush Sound leader, respectively, stayed up for hours discussing astrophysics, science fiction, and the perils of inter-dimensional love. The next morning, Goodman and Morgan—the latter also makes atmospheric pop as Springtime Carnivore—turned that intergalactic brainstorm into 2013’s “Space Time.” It was an intense, Spectorian ode to zero-gravity heartbreak: “While our souls seemed to fit\\/The planets weren’t aligned,” they sang, “And so we’ll never meet in this space-time.” The song marked their formal debut as Books of Love—but with Goodman hard at work on La Sera’s dreamy Hour of the Dawn and Morgan gearing up to tour with the Hush Sound, they couldn’t stay long (or perhaps, the planets weren’t aligned).By early 2016, another laid-back jam session ensued in Morgan’s backyard. The women were playing around with harmonies, ad-libbing over their favorite songs. Morgan tore into a Misfits cover—the crude, foreboding “Where Eagles Dare”—and Goodman followed suit, prompting a dramatic transformation. Danzig’s uniform snarl (“I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch”) had blossomed into a honeyed, if foul-mouthed, duet.Intrigued by this contrast, Goodman and Morgan started looking at other punk songs through a pop prism: a study presented on their new collaborative punk covers album, Take It, It’s Yours. Besides the aforementioned “Where Eagles Dare,” the record includes reinterpretations of Bad Brains’ “Pay to Cum,” the Stooges’ “I Wanna Be Your Dog,” and the Replacements’ “Bastards of Young,” among other famous tales from the gutter. Some are gussied up with marimba and vibraphone; others sound straight out of Laurel Canyon circa ’65. All of them are prime listening for a late-summer pool party, and none of them sound punk at all. Yet, by hitching unruly sentiments to pleasant arrangements, Goodman and Morgan gesture towards a wider disconnect between text and subtext. And one could argue that unity by way of disunity—a mentality of us vs. them—is what punk’s all about.Across Take It, It’s Yours, the duo leave the lyrics and broader melodic outlines of its source material alone. They’re more interested in thematic reconfigurations than they are musical re-enactment: how does punk’s visceral, acerbic sentiment manifest when it’s incubated in a loungier space? As it turns out, this palette is largely owed to the project’s cinematic spirit: “We wanted these songs to fit on the soundtrack of a desert-noir mystery film,” Morgan joked in an interview, going on to cite the lauded composer Ennio Morricone as a key influence on the album’s expanded soundscapes. Tarantino should give it a look: between the twangy slide guitar leads on “Pay to Cum” and the Jam’s “In the City,” and the spaghetti-western shuffle grafted onto Gun Club’s “Sex Beat,” he would find plenty to work with.Goodman and Morgan’s shared penchant for ’60s pop remains a cornerstone of their collaborations, manifested in dulcet point-counterpoints and bubblegum hooks. They’re covering bands that represent the opposite, but these friends have more in common with their heroes than you’d expect. After all, listening to the original versions of the Buzzcock’s “Ever Fallen in Love?” or Blondie’s “Dreaming,” with their impassioned choruses and deft chord progressions, you might never guess they arose from the underbelly. Regardless of scene or background, everyone can appreciate a spirited ode to fallin’ in love with someone you shouldn’t have fallen in love with, because who hasn’t? The problem is that the duo’s version isn’t exactly spirited: a wan, lazy tango wiped clean of the Buzzcocks’ panic-stricken tempos and manic chatter. Here, Pete Shelley’s frantic lamentations (“We won’t be together much longer\\/Unless we realize we’re the same”) scan as glum resignations; it’s hard not to yawn as the hand-wringing sentiments drift off on the women’s soaring contraltos.Their mission proves more successful on the opener, a haunting, slide-heavy take on Wipers’ “Over the Edge” that gracefully exposes the aching heart of the Portlandians’ war against the establishment. “Grow up and be a man,” Morgan croons, Goodman echoing in her stead, “Drop dead right where you stand.” When Greg Sage spat that screed in 1983, he was chastising society. That two women are now the ones casting out this sardonic, hyper-masculine directive only provides further testament to their clever choice to reinterpret not only this song, but similarly carnal numbers like “Where Eagles Dare” and “Sex Beat.”Take It, It’s Yours may be one of the comfiest cover-sets in recent memory, but beneath its chilled-out façade lurks an identity crisis. On one hand, the duo’s stylistic declawing of Danzig and company offers new ways to revisit and expand upon the decades-old punk canon—in terms of sonic contrast as well as gender and generation gaps. But in taking inherently gnarled, messy songs—ostensibly composed in opposition to the status quo—cleaning them up, and having them play nice, Goodman and Morgan have relinquished the urgent energy that made them feel so impactful to begin with. Think of the record as a well-behaved, happy-hour riot: the rebellion doesn’t amount to much, but at least there’s the escape.\"],[22252,\"In techno, few records are more iconic than “The Bells,” a 1996 track by Jeff Mills. Relentless and reduced, it exemplifies the building-block nature of Mills’ art as something meant to be layered across three or four turntables. Thanks to its queasy, carnivalesque melody, it also stands easily and proudly on its own. Kornél Kovács’ “The Bells,” the title track of his debut album, doesn’t sound anything like Mills’ version: Where the minimalist classic is stern and hard-angled, Kovács’ is cheerful and easygoing, flecked with chimes, warm strings, and peppy vocal samples. But I would be surprised if the precedent for his choice of title didn't at least cross Kovács’ mind. Given his fondness for sampling vintage disco, he’s cleary a guy who knows his music history. Someone coming from underground dance music, like he does, can’t title a record “The Bells” and not be reminded of the original. Which makes it something of a cheeky maneuver—a shot across the bow that leaves a rainbow tracer in its wake.Kovács likes to have fun with references: His 2015 track “Space Jam” was a tribute to Quad City DJs’ theme to the 1996 Michael Jordan\\/Bugs Bunny film, for crying out loud. He likes to have fun, period. As a co-founder of Stockholm’s Studio Barnhus label, he’s spent the past six years developing a quirky aesthetic that draws freely from disco, Italo, freestyle, and easy listening. But his idea of fun is different from the kind of “fun” that you tend to find in dance music. In fact, there isn’t a lot of fun in dance music right now. Stone-faced cool rules the underground, while the antics prevalent in commercial EDM—marshmallow masks, cakes to the face, garish pyrotechnics—are too cynical, too calculated, to qualify as innocent or carefree. But once upon a time, when disco ruled, a single could reasonably be expected to elicit smiles on the dance floor, and that’s the impulse driving Kovács’ debut album.The record opens with a beatless, 98-second snippet of Kovács’ 2014 single “Szikra” that glows like a cotton-candy lamp, but after that it’s all about dizzy rug-cutting, darting through loopy disco bass lines, spongy funk keys, and oohing-and-ahhing choral pads. “Gex” is conga-line mayhem on a heaving cruise ship, all flushed cheeks, flailing arms, and lifejackets lodged in chandeliers. “Dance… While the Record Spins” stacks staccato harmonies into brittle configurations, yielding something like Laurie Anderson’s “O Superman” on laughing gas. And “Pop” evokes childlike innocence from pastel squiggles over a skipping, jacking drum groove, like an Akufen track smeared in color crayons.Not everything is so chipper. “BB,” one of the album's highlights, exemplifies one of The Bells’ key contradictions. The beat is a cracking disco break broadcasting basement-party vibes at their most unhinged. But a more sorrowful undercurrent flows beneath its cathartic rush. “Szív Utca”—Hungarian for “Heart Street”—is equally bittersweet, and the slinky “Dollar Club,” tugged between crisp drums and weepy keys, balances a playful spirit with more melancholy vibes. You could imagine any of these tunes getting played by DJs like DJ Koze, Michael Mayer, Superpitcher, or any other selector with a winking sense of humor and a bleeding heart. But while it is music made first and foremost for club play, there’s enough variety here to make The Bells a satisfying listen on the headphones. The loping, dem-bow-patterned “Josey’s Tune” sounds like Kovács’ take on DJ Mujava’s “Township Funk.” Not only is his rhythmic sensibility is far more nuanced than most of his peers’, he is a master of both texture and empty space. His sound breathes even as it giggles.Even the saddest, slowest song here, the closing “Urszusz,” comes off like something from a children’s cartoon, rendering a watery, Harold Budd-like piano melody with wide-eyed wonder. It’s followed by a moment of silence and a bizarre hidden track that sounds like a voicemail message chanted in sing-songy, heavily accented English. “What’s his name, Kornél Kovács!” sings his exuberant and quite possibly inebriated caller, over and over, with great gusto. It’s the kind of thing you might wake up to on your phone after a long, blurry, and indescribably fun night, and it’s the coup de grace for an album that brings good times back to dance music. \"],[22260,\"Since their 1983 debut Knees and Bones, the Long Island-based Controlled Bleeding’s 30-plus albums have spanned a dizzying array of genres including noise, industrial, no wave, prog, psych, dub, and jazz (just to name a few). Likewise, Larva Lumps and Baby Bumps—the band’s first album since 2002, and also their first since the deaths of key members Chris Moriarty and Joe Papa—cuts a wide swath through musical styles. But at this stage of a four-decade career defined by relentless exploration, it would be too easy for Controlled Bleeding to rest on the audacity of its kitchen-sink mentality alone.Bandleader Paul Lemos imagined the album's grotesque cover art (by musician\\/visual artist Gregory Jacobsen) would fit the music because he found it “simultaneously beautiful and revolting.” But even if Larva Lumps contains its fair share of sonic provocation, its deeper allure lies in the band’s ability to rein in and unify their musical appetites. For someone who appears to have first resorted to noise because of his limited musical skills, Lemos has grown into a seasoned bandleader who can extract near-miraculous levels of flexibility from his supporting cast while also keeping it raw, like a compromise between the trebly chicken-scratch sound of classic Chrome and the layering of modern Swans.If you were to play this album on shuffle along with the band’s back-catalog, it would be difficult to distinguish the new material from the old. Larva Lumps’ gaunt, boxed-in production sounds mistakable for a low-budget indie-label recording from the late ’80s or early ’90s—the kind that just couldn’t be mastered to sound very “full” on CD. That said, the band is undeniably patient, even where latter-day members Chvad SB, Mike Bazini, and longtime drummer Anthony Meola’s programming lean more towards youthful passion than refinement.The psych-rock of opener “Driving Through Darkness” sets the tone for the rest of the album. Over a hypnotic, uptempo groove, jousting organ and guitar lines recall ’60s garage stylings that Can would have bastardized decades ago, or Obits would have done this century. Lemos and company could easily have settled for a genre exercise. Instead, the song surpasses its own stylistic trappings as it ramps down towards its conclusion. When the drums drop out and Lemos drops twinkling harmonics over a gurgling bass line, it’s a rather convincing impression of Yes’ Steve Howe at the beginning of “Roundabout.”That decision at the end of “Driving Through Darkness” underscores the subtlety and taste that Controlled Bleeding sustains throughout Lava Lumps' two-disc sprawl. (The first disc contains studio material recorded over a four-year stretch, while the second disc consists of live-in-the-studio recordings helmed by underground production icon Martin Bisi). On roughly a third of the album—“Carving Song,” “Swarm,” and the 23-minute noise opus “The Perks of Being a Perv”— the band uses high-pitched static as if it were a weapon. Light years away from the unbridled retching of Knees and Bones, however, these tunes actually hold together thanks to Lemos’ tight arrangements.As a seasoned composer, Lemos never allows the songs to lose their pulse or their sense of space, and his affinity for both becomes even more apparent when you measure the noise- and rock-oriented tunes against the melodic ones. On “As Evening Fades,” for example, he laces a picturesque piano loop with clean-toned guitar work that verges on new-age jazz. A younger act with something to prove might not have been able to resist marring the song with uglier sounds. Larva Lumps has plenty of those, but Lemos clearly understands the value of not forcing them into the picture. It allows even the most caustic moments to reveal the beauty at its core.\"],[22321,\"On their last album, 2006’s 15 Again, the French duo Cassius found themselves faced with a not-uncommon problem for European dance acts in the 21st century. Here they were, in mid-career and on their third album, trapped beneath the overlapping shadows of Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx. The result was a mixed bag of funk and house and funky house, broken up by the occasional grab at pop’s brass ring. Naturally, there was a Pharrell cameo. It was a tough spot to be in for a duo with such an unassailable pedigree. Hubert Blanc-Fracard and Philippe Cerboneschi’s roots run deep in the French dance scene. In the early 1990s, they were architects of MC Solaar’s jazzy boom-bap sound, and their records for Mo Wax under an earlier alias, La Funk Mob, were trip-hoppy highlights of the label’s peak years. Cerboneschi, meanwhile, is a veteran of Motorbass, a pioneering French house duo that helped pave the way for Daft Punk’s filter-disco revolution.For a while, Cassius remained central to a scene they’d helped mold. The duo’s debut album, 1999, was a smart, stylish amalgam of retro cues—disco loops, hip-hop scratches, moody Chicago house—that, aside from the Gwen McCrae-sampling single “Feeling for You,” made few overtures to pop. Instead, it put all its effort into building a sustained mood, translating the sound of hip Parisian discotheques to the album format. With their next two albums, 2002’s Au Rêve and 2006’s 15 Again, they expanded their horizons, determined to out-pastiche their peers. They managed a few memorable singles and some righteous curveballs—see, for instance, the Tom Zé-interpolating “Telephone Love”—but as they vacillated between impish pop, funk maximalism, and squirrelly electronic B-sides, they lost their footing.Ibifornia is their first album in a decade, not counting 2010’s back-to-basics The Rawkers EP, for Ed Banger, and it suggests that Cassius still haven’t figured out quite who they want to be. Let it not be said that they are afraid to take risks, beginning with their coterie of collaborators: Beastie Boys’ Mike D, OneRepublic frontman and pop gun-for-hire Ryan Tedder, Parisian house vocalist JAW, Chan Marshall of Cat Power, and, once again, Pharrell. What, as another of Pharrell’s collaborators might put it, a time to be alive.Sometimes, those risks pay off handsomely. “Action” builds to an extended climax of dubwise Afro-disco, and the lustrous Chan Marshall shines like the glint off thick velvet, impervious to Mike D’s yelps. The song might not need all nine minutes of its running time—nor a feinting fade-out and reprise—but it’s plenty hypnotic, with Laurent Bardainne’s saxophone and Arnold Moueza’s percussion keeping the energy at a rolling boil. On “Go Up,” another dramatic disco number, Pharrell is Pharrell, while Marshall is sadness incarnate, her descending refrain of “Jealousy” slumping like the shoulders of an inconsolable lover. Who knew that Cat Power would sound so terrific singing over house music? Someone needs to construct an entire album of club tracks around her.But those standouts struggle to hold their own amid the album's more overwrought anthems and straight-up misfires. “Feel Like Me” puts Marshall ahead of an imaginary union of Spiritualized and M83, and it almost works; so does the opulent ballad “Blue Jean Smile,” sung by John Gourley (of indie rockers Portugal. The Man). But even the most immaculate mood-setting can’t save it from its ridiculous chorus: “Your blue jean smile says\\/Let’s have a child\\/Peruvian style\\/We’ll let it run wild.”The Ryan Tedder songs simply feel like they're trying way too hard. “The Missing,” which opens the album, is a hiccuping, sighing, thrust-for-thrust remake of Robin Thicke et al.’s “Blurred Lines,” a maneuver that feels about three years too late (and given the legal brouhaha around that song, why would you even want to go there?), while the soaring, ’60s-flavored “Hey You!” panders shamelessly to the Coachella flower-crown crowd. Like a lot of Tedder’s work, it’s plenty catchy; it’s just too much. Gospel choirs, falsetto yips, bellowing baritone sax, and a chorus that runs, “And if you feel the same\\/Shadows turn into rain.” To call it bombastic would be putting it lightly. And then there’s “Ibifornia,” a tongue-in-cheek paean to tropical house music—abuzz with roaring lions, screeching monkeys, trilling loons—that winks so hard it risks eyelid cramps. (Those incessant loons, a staple of Balearic dance music, are a dead giveaway that the song is nothing if not self-aware.) Narrated by the British voice actor Gary Martin, who spells out the letters of the title in a booming, Barry White-like baritone—“‘I’ is for ‘I love you,’ ‘B’ is for ‘brotherhood,’” etc.—it's gleefully ridiculous, and as it builds, it develops into a potent, throbbing, peak-time tribal-house jam. But it’s so over the top that it’s a little hard to take seriously, and therein lies the problem. Do clubbers whose pulses race to the sound of rat-a-tat 909 hi-hats really want to be distracted by goofy, lovey-dovey voiceovers? Do punters coming up on E really want what amounts to a comedy record? Like the portmanteau title, which joins Ibiza to California under the banner of balmy reverie, it’s torn between two things that really don’t have anything to do with each other. When presented with apples and oranges, instead of sangria they made Four Loko.In an album that foregrounds voices, one of the best and most surprising cuts is “Ponce,” the record’s instrumental closer. It’s the only song credited to the duo alone, and as simple as it is—just a shuffling, barely-there drumbeat and a moody synth line—its emotional pull is undeniable. In its singular focus, it’s reminiscent of Motorbass, but it also sounds undeniably fresh; in its sound and mood and spirit of reinvention, it faintly recalls Mr. Fingers’ recent “Qwazars.” It’s a reminder that, at their best, Cassius remain among France’s most expressive house producers. It’s a shame that, in chasing palm trees from Hollywood to Vila d’Eivissa, they’ve lost sight of the splendors that lie closer to home.\"],[22280,\"Red Pill has studied his depression. He knows how it works and where it comes from, but the 28-year old Michigan rapper rarely seems to crawl towards relief. Pill, whose real name is Chris Orrick, has frequently come off as an endearing and relatable deadbeat in his raps, but his second solo album inches away from light-hearted self-deprecation in favor of darker introspection. On Instinctive Drowning, the Detroit MC raps about his hand-me-down alcoholism and depression, contextualizing his illnesses as both personal and genetic. Caught in his own mind, the Mello Music Group artist—who is also one-third of the proudly blue-collar underground hip-hop group Ugly Heroes—is a fervent over-analyzer. This tendency sometimes spins his raps into histrionic narration. “I’ve been heartsick\\/So consider this catharsis,” he sputters triumphantly on the album’s first track, a clumsily obvious recap for such a patently emotional song. This awkward self-referencing falls flat at times, but Red Pill is sincere and his pain never feels like a put-on. Noticeably, Instinctive Drowning carries some of the best and most tailored production that Orrick has enjoyed yet as a solo rapper, driven by a single-producer approach. In this case, San Diego producer\\/rapper Ill Poetic has upgraded Pill’s previous stable of jazzy boom-bap for a more eclectic and ambitiously moody palette. While some tracks stick to Red Pill’s initial wheelhouse of snappy drums, Ill Poetic is also as apt to construct a new groove as he is to rotely loop up an old one. “Jeffrey Star” freewheels loosely with a Sun Ra-inspired gait to start; “When the Devil Knocks” sounds like boom-bap-inspired crime funk. Many of the songs meander into musical bridges and soulful change-ups, but sometimes the effect is squandered. On “Four Part Cure,” the distorted guitar-driven switch-up sounds forced into place instead of urgently called for.This new album also contains Red Pill’s strongest rapping to date. The painfully clever album name is crystallized when Orrick recounts his mother’s early death in gripping detail on the title track. “Just shy of the age when her liver failed\\/Most of my money been spent on liquor sales,” he raps, reluctantly lining himself up for the same fate. Red Pill is almost never upbeat, but there’s a charm to his soul-searching.  As a lyricist Red Pill isn’t flashy as much as casually confident. But sometimes Orrick’s delivery hobbles awkwardly. His hooks are often chanted monotonously in a rarely intoned but variously syncopated flow, an artifact of his general reluctance toward singing. Here and there it works, but an album full of these choruses gums up the momentum. Elsewhere, Pill collapses into a weirdly contrived voice on “Club Privilege,” his almost tongue-in-cheek stab at a self-assured party track that doesn’t quite hit the mark as a lucid P.S.A. about white privilege. (And yet the self-awareness is productive if not clunky.) Along with the title track, the best songs on Instinctive Drowning are sandwiched in the middle. “Fuck Your Ambition” carries the record’s lone listed feature in the form of a charged-up P.O.S. verse. Both Orrick and Ill Poetic make the Minneapolis punk MC sound at home: the producer provides an ambient beat with tweaking, mechanical drum programming, while Red Pill borrows some of P.O.S.’ shouty, disjointed cadence. On “Gin & Tonic,” one of album’s lead singles and one of the artist’s best songs to date, Orrick shares a wistfully cautious optimism about his relationship, drinking, and pervasive sadness. It’s a telling highlight. The rapper both wallows in and stirs from his depression throughout Instinctive Drowning, which is an album largely devoted to the inevitability and persistence of a tormented mind. Red Pill never seems to find solace as much as endurance. \"],[22231,\"“100 Fold,” the leadoff track on this sophomore EP from DJ\\/producer Caleb Halter (a.k.a. Feral) begins with a soothing keyboard fade-in that lasts all of 20 seconds before Halter interrupts it with rolling layers of abrasion. First comes a supremely fat bass note, then a jarring touch of glitch, followed by a pitch-shifted four-note hook that sounds like a digitized blend of human vocals and wood flutes. If you’ve set foot anywhere near a dance floor in the past, oh, 15 years or so, you instinctively expect a tune like this to unfold with a bass drop followed by a forceful groove based on the hook, with some whiplash-inducing glitch thrown in for good measure.In a club setting, Halter could’ve easily ridden that stereotype into a repetitive trance. But the bass drop and groove never arrive. Instead, Halter teases at both while “100 Fold” froths with atmospheres that threaten to reclaim the spotlight. After a minute and a half, the music simply fades away, but in that space Halter establishes the central dynamic at the core of the five tunes that comprise this EP: From start to finish, he keeps one foot in an ambient headspace and another in the ear-rattling clamor of the club. On Feral’s first EP, last year’s Relay, as well as on his contributions to comps by Ghostly and Lucky Me, Halter appeared to be searching for a comfortable medium between those two modes. On this new material, he sounds restless and focused on sonic opposition as much as balance. If you like the element of surprise—or if you enjoy hearing boisterous dance-floor gestures through headphones and, in reverse, gauzy ambient nuance at loud volumes—Nexus keeps in perpetual flux, never quite resting in one world or the other. Nexus also demonstrates Halter’s deliberate attention to timing. After he leaves you pining for a beat at the abrupt conclusion of “100 Fold,” he delivers on the remaining four songs, all of which are either anchored by strong beats (“Hyphen,” “We Feel You”), arrangements that suggest them even without any percussion (“Sum”), or a combination of both (“Wasp”). In all four cases, though, Halter continuously throws curveballs, some more subtle than others. “Wasp” starts off with a digital frost-like coating of atmosphere that appears to be heading straight for ambient territory, which makes the sudden onset of brash 808 pomp feel almost rude. From this point onwards, Halter allows the grooves to establish themselves enough to bob your head or move your body to them. However if you actually try to dance to this music, you’ll be presented with challenges.In the middle of “Wasp” there’s a section where the groove drops out and the music just hovers, suspended, before it’s clear where things are going to go next. Meanwhile, when he captures the ham-fisted bombast of drum‘n’bass and glitch on “Hyphen,” for example, one gets the sense that some of his choices verge on satire. (“Nexus” is also the name of a software plug-in that Halter describes as dated and cheesy.) It takes attentive listening to notice that Halter often undercuts his gaudier sounds with finer details.Nexus ends with “We Feel You,” a track whose triumphant overtones and skittering rhythm recall Middle of Nowhere-era Orbital. It sounds like the fabricated optimism of a closing credits sequence to a Hollywood blockbuster. But when you compare it to the more overtly uplifting “Ceremony,” the tune that closes Relay, it’s clear that Halter is moving away from emotional directness and into more guileful self-presentation. At times, Nexus appears to overstate what it is, only to leave you questioning whether you've properly read or even misread its intentions. Given Halter’s sense of precision, the push-pull of his music is both intentional and very rewarding. \"],[22311,\"In certain circles, My Morning Jacket’s Carl Broemel is a bona fide guitar hero, especially among guitar magazine subscribers and jam music enthusiasts most likely to appreciate an inventive solo. It was only after Broemel joined the group for 2005’s Z that they cemented their reputation as a powerhouse live outfit, and his dynamic shredding has propelled their most memorable shows, including the rain-drenched, nearly four-hour 2008 Bonnaroo set that’s taken on nearly legendary status among fans. Among casual listeners, however, Broemel is virtually unrecognized, and even many My Morning Jacket fans don’t give his contributions to the group much thought. Despite the mountains of evidence that My Morning Jacket is a true band, Jim James looms so large over his peers that it can be hard to think of the group as anything other than a vehicle for its enigmatic singer.For his part, Broemel has shown little interest in challenging that perception. If he wanted to make the case for his talents, his solo albums would give him the outlet to prove that he’s the clear savant of the band—that he deserved his own entry in that Rolling Stone New Guitar Gods list, rather than having to share one with James. Yet Broemel seems perfectly content where he is, even if that means being in James’ shadow. Instead of showing off the same guitar heroics he brings to My Morning Jacket’s Das Boot-length live shows, Broemel opted for a more understated, songwriterly approach on his 2010 record All Birds Say, and his follow-up 4th of July is a similarly folksy affair, another pleasantly low-key outing from a musician with absolutely nothing to prove.Just once does 4th of July toss some red meat to My Morning Jacket fans, hinting at the guitar lover’s record it could have been. On the panoramic, 10-minute title track, Broemel cycles through one buttery solo after another, each richer and more textured than the last. With Neko Case bolstering the soaring chorus, the whole thing feels that much more decadent. Those fireworks are the exception, though. Opener “Sleepy Lagoon,” with its drowsy tempo and sighing keyboards, is more representative of the record’s sticky, late-night feel (he kicks off the record by literally greeting the moon). From the finger-picked “Snowflake” to the Elliott Smith-esque “Rockingchair Dancer,” a lullaby that Broemel wrote for his young son, the whole thing sounds like it was recorded in an extremely comfortable chair.Laura Veirs lends some harmony vocals to that last song, while My Morning Jacket keyboard Bo Koster and bassist Tom Blankenship sit in on much of the record. And although James is absent, it feels like he’s there in spirit. Broemel’s serviceable tenor may not have the feral majesty of James’ howl, but his cadence and phrasing are similar enough that many of these songs feel like they were written with James’ voice in mind. Mellower numbers like “Crawlspace” and “In The Dark” invite listeners to color in the empty spaces in their head, imagining how these songs might have been fleshed out if My Morning Jacket had tried to slip them onto The Waterfall.It’s a safe bet they would have been a lot wilder. 4th of July makes the case for Broemel as the classicist of the band, avoiding the experimental detours into prog, psychedelia, and funk that have made My Morning Jacket’s records so rewarding and\\/or frustrating. Its pleasures are modest but dependable. Even Broemel’s lyrics are easygoing, dotted with repeated observations that things are just fine the way they are. “I keep telling myself that it’s all the same\\/ Whether someone is humble or big and grand,” Broemel sings on “Landing Gear.” It’s not the same at all, of course, but where the rest of the world celebrates music’s most restless spirits, 4th of July offers the gentle assurance that there’s merit in being the guy who gets a solid eight hours a night, too.\"],[22295,\"At first, Frank Ocean was simply a great storyteller. Then he became the story—an avatar for all of our fluid modern ideals. He could be the dynamic human of the future, exploding age-old binaries with an eloquent note, melting racial divisions with a devastating turn of phrase or quick flit to falsetto. He breathed hope. Then he went away.Years clicked by. It was easy to worry. There are precedents for this sort of thing, for disappearances, for the self-implosion of black genius. Lauryn Hill. Dave Chappelle. “Black stardom is rough,” Chris Rock once said. “You represent the race, and you have responsibilities that go beyond your art. How dare you just be excellent?” The Rock quote is from a 2012 profile of the reclusive D’Angelo, who felt compelled to release his first album in 14 years following the shooting of Michael Brown; the moment spurred him on.Faced with a hellish loop of police brutality, other musical leaders like Kendrick Lamar and Beyoncé came forth with brilliant righteousness as well. But not Frank. Though he posted several elegant messages online, reacting to horrors in Ferguson and Orlando, his relative silence only grew louder as tensions outside continued to rise. The stoic empathy he beamed throughout Channel Orange was missed. There was a yearning for his perspective—how he could soothe without losing sight of what’s important. How he allowed us to escape within his carefully drawn characters while never letting us off the hook. How his voice was allergic to nonsense, how it could shatter a heart into dust.It still can. “RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me,” he sings on “Nikes,” the opening track from Blonde, his wary exhale of a new album. In the song’s video, Frank holds up a framed photo of the 17-year-old martyr, the boy’s sad eyes tucked inside a hoodie. Even now, four years after the Florida teen was shot and killed with Skittles in his pocket, the line jolts. It’s also the most overtly political statement Frank makes across the entire record. And “Nikes” is hardly a call to arms. The song is a woozy, faded, screwed-down odyssey, replete with helium warble and dewy third eye—and it’s actually one of the album’s most propulsive tracks.On its surface, Blonde seems tremendously insular. Whereas Channel Orange showed off an expansive eclecticism, this album contracts at nearly every turn. Its spareness suggests a person in a small apartment with only a keyboard and a guitar and thoughts for company. But it isn’t just anyone emoting from the abyss, it’s Frank Ocean. In his hands, such intimacy attracts the ear, bubbles the brain, raises the flesh. These songs are not for marching, but they still serve a purpose. They’re about everyday lives, about the feat of just existing, which is a statement in its own right. Trayvon Martin would be 21 today, and Blonde is filled with feelings and ideas—deep love, heady philosophy, despondent loss—that he may have never had a chance to experience for himself. The stories Frank tells here find solace in sorrow. They’re fucked up and lonely, but not indulgent. They offer views into unseen places and overlooked souls. They console. They bleed. And yes, they cry.The power of Frank’s work often comes via extreme transparency, but he’s not writing diaries. It’s about how he’s able to locate the crux of any situation, or expose undue artifice, or peel things back to their naked core. Like how he skewed L.A. privilege without breaking a sweat on “Super Rich Kids” or broke down the Coachella generation’s bored numbness in five minutes on “Novacane.” Recently, he’s expanded this skill beyond music. It’s in the “Nikes” video, which both takes advantage of movie magic, like lighting a man (Frank?!) on fire, only to deflate the trickery by also showing the crew of extinguishers putting him out. It’s in the oversized, seven pound, coffee table magazine Boys Don’t Cry, which came out along with the new album; in it, screenshots of internet histories—perhaps the most accurate mirror of our modern selves—are on full display, along with literally naked bodies on and around his beloved sports cars, and charmingly unfiltered interviews with fellow artists and friends. (These chats can get a bit stoner-y, though amusingly so; in one, Frank asks Lil B, “is money sexy?”)And this transparency was also expressed in the current campaign’s prolonged rollout, which at one point had fans watching Frank watch paint dry as part of a live stream lead-up to a visual album called Endless. As a piece of filmed entertainment, Endless is painfully dull, and perhaps that’s the point. As we watch Frank build a spiral staircase with his bare hands, the piece offers a sort of anti-promo message that comments on how an album’s release strategy can often diminish the art it’s built to uphold nowadays. Or maybe, you know, it’s just really dull. Either way, the Endless soundtrack is much more exciting—46 minutes of music that plays like a mixtape, sliding from song to song, demo to demo, like scrolling through Frank’s hard drive of unreleased material. It’s an intriguing peek into his process, and it contains some of the rawest vocal takes he’s ever put out—like on the strung-out power ballad “Rushes”—but it lacks the clarity of Blonde. (In a neat inversion, it now looks like Frank used the relatively minor Endless to fulfill his major label contract and then self-released Blonde, the main event—though both were exclusives to Apple Music, putting into question what “self-released” even means at this point.)With Blonde’s unobtrusive instrumentation—large swaths go by without any drums whatsoever—the album could be mistaken for background music. But then Frank’s voice enters, and the overall quietness turns into a soft spotlight, capturing attention. It’s a technique pioneered by noted minimalists like Brian Eno and Rick Rubin, both of whom are included in Blonde’s who’s who list of contributors and inspirations. Many tracks feel emptied, with only the plain strumming of an electric guitar or foggy atmospherics left behind. But they mesmerize. Even a song like “Nights,” which sounds straightforward at first with its shards of silvery chords and midtempo beat, eventually turns into a strange shredding solo before ending with what sounds like a Drake dream heard underwater. “Nights” is not an anomaly. It’s the album’s centerpiece, by an artist who is following nobody but himself.Frank is 28 now, and his voice has grown stronger and more dexterous, while some of his tales have become more abstract. “Skyline To” is essentially a tone poem about sex, summer, and California haze backed by mood and mystery. “Godspeed” nods to gospel but stays grounded in its prayer to steadfast but broken love; a short story in the magazine, also called “Godspeed,” reads like uncanny science fiction but is actually based on Frank’s boyhood. Certain things are clear, though. The big questions are on his mind. He’s aware of his mortality now. He’s thinking about families, about what it means to live outside society, whether that’s a sustainable goal. He contemplates settling down with “two kids and a swimming pool” on “Seigfried,” a song that works in words by Elliott Smith and ends with a spaced-out soliloquy about living life in the red before a random solar flare brings chaos unto earth. This is not light fare. But the touch is oh so feathery. On “Solo,” he contemplates various stages of singledom, from the jacket-throwing hedonism to the smoked-out emptiness, with nothing but a churchly organ backing him up. It’s a stunning piece of songwriting that ultimately finds some peace with being alone. It sounds like a friend.Later on, “Solo (Reprise)” marks the album’s only major vocal guest appearance, with a devastating, head-spinning verse from André 3000. It pinpoints one of Blonde’s major themes: nostalgia. André looks back on his 20 years in hip-hop and feels duped by rappers who don’t write their own rhymes. “I’m hummin’ and whistlin’ to those not deserving,” he says, amid a conclusion that will likely haunt Drake’s nightmares for years. “I’ve stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?” There is disappointment in his voice, and some bitterness. André’s disillusionment could be a cautionary tale for Frank, who often uses the album as an opportunity to look back with a rosy tint: climbing trees, Michael Jackson, cannonballs off the porch, Stevie Wonder. It makes sense for an artist who titled his first major project Nostalgia, Ultra. when he was only 23. Longing looks good on him, though, especially when he’s able to harness it to aching effect on “Self Control” and “White Ferrari,” songs that fight off despondency with a sadness that feels three-dimensional.The album ends with a final look in the rearview, in the form of spliced-up old interviews with some of Frank’s young friends as well as his brother Ryan, who was around 11 at the time. A cozy keyboard rolls in the background as the boys talk about who they are and what they wish for. Carefree laughs—the kind that adults can’t seem to utter—are looped. Harsh static constantly intrudes, though, hinting at the distortions of time. These brief talks are also transcribed in the magazine alongside photos, and when asked about his dream superpowers, Ryan says, “I want to be invisible, I want to fly, and I want to be invincible.” His bright eyes peer out from under a Supreme cap and pink bandana. He looks like he might pull it all off.\"],[22285,\"Nuclear energy produces anxiety in Japan. Long a controversial topic, it became a renewed source of worry following the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi power plant during the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. Fears stirred by the aftermath—and of similar incidents occurring—caused a nationwide furor in subsequent years, leading citizens across the nation to speak out about how little they trusted the government tasked with harnessing a nuclear program. Anger over Fukushima even drew out a group that isn’t always eager to get political in Japan—musicians. Long constrained by commercial commitments, performers such as Ryuichi Sakamoto and Kazuyoshi Sato criticized the government’s handling of the situation online and appeared at protests against nuclear power. Still, many artists chose to express anger and worry through heavy metaphor rather than directly, if at all.The Atomic Bomb Compilation series is direct with rage. Started in 2012 by Hiroshima juke producer CRZKNY, the project gathered dance songs around the theme of “the tragedy caused by abuse of nuclear energy.” The United States’ use of atomic weapons on CRZKNY’s hometown and Nagasaki at the end of World War II were remembered on these collections, both as memorial and reminder of nuclear energy's destructive past. The music, fittingly, is ominous and frequently chaotic. Although initially heavy on domestic artists and footwork, later releases brought in creators from around the world dabbling in a variety of styles. Vol. 4, released on the 71st anniversary of Japan’s surrender, is the best installment yet, featuring over a dozen electronic acts coming together to painfully reflect and highlight the paranoia of present-day nuclear power.Protest sits at the center of Atomic Bomb Compilation Vol. 4, but it also offers a snapshot of how international artists have absorbed the Chicago-born juke sounds in the years since RP Boo, Traxman, and the Teklife crew started receiving increased attention. This set features contributions from Japanese producers, members of Polish Juke, creators in Mexico and beyond, each giving their own perspective on the high-energy style. Jakub Lemiszewski pushes “Exceeding” towards suffocating levels with rippling synths, while Argentina’s Aylu makes good use of space on compilation closer “Y_Y,” a cut where every breath and skittery drum hit lingers in the air. Although most of the tracks here at dance-floor speeds, the mood permeating Atomic Bomb Compilation Vol. 4 is rarely joyful. Opening number “e_i_r,” courtesy of Hyogo’s jue6ons, is an eight-and-a-half-minute warning signal that slowly grows in intensity. The following songs unfold more swiftly but use the cornerstones of juke to create uneasy atmospheres. “Bakushinchi,” a team-up between Kyoto’s Gnyonpix and Melbourne’s DJ Innes, takes a steely drum machine and places them next to synth gurgles that highlight the stiffness of the beat, making for a disconcerting feel. Organizer CRZKNY takes it even further on his three contributions, embracing sharp metallic textures that give footwork-ready cuts such as “Vida” a dangerous edge. When the album deviates from juke during the gutter drone of Black OPS’ “Ruins Lining” or “Hiroshima’s A-Bell” by Polish creator Paide—featuring a field recording of chirping birds slowly folding into harsh white noise—the end result still feels unnerving. The bulk of Vol. 4’s tracks don’t call out nuclear energy or accidents directly, opting instead to create a paranoid atmosphere mirroring the worries of the atomic age. Yet other instances are far more direct, whether referencing former prime ministers who helped bring Japan’s nuclear industry to peak prominence (producer Franz Snake’s “Yasuhiro Nakasone Said,” a jittery track featuring the former PM’s voice sliced and diced) or being very on the nose with what they are trying to recreate (lililL’s “Atomic Explosion,” the comp’s most cacophonous moment). Juke’s use of repetition, meanwhile, drives home deliberate messages sampled from familiar figures. Chicago’s bahnhof::zoo takes a snippet of Barack Obama's speech during his historic visit to Hiroshima earlier this year and makes it the center of “Fell From The Sky.” On the very next song, UK artist Count Vanderhoff centers the piece around a soundbite of Scottish Parliament member George Kerevan asking new UK prime minister Theresa May, “Is she personally prepared to authorize a nuclear strike that can kill a hundred thousand innocent men, women, and children?” (She said, “Yes.”)At 25 songs, Atomic Bomb Compilation Vol. 4 is an overwhelming listen given its intentionally bleak vibe. But this series isn’t meant to be an escape. It memorializes immense human suffering brought on by nuclear weaponry and looms high as a cautionary tale for catastrophic misuse of nuclear energy. There’s very little fun to be found in exploring the concept of man-made Armageddon. Instead, this collection highlights the urgency of a highly politicized issue and soundtracks an uneasy, uncertain life in the atomic age. \"],[22249,\"As a love letter to John Cage, multi-instrumentalist and composer Peter Broderick based most of his seventh solo album Partners on Cage’s concept of chance-based composition. Before writing any of the album’s original material, Broderick learned to play Cage’s solo piano piece “In a Landscape” by listening to various recorded versions and breaking them down note for note. That process inspired him to look beyond Cage’s musical ideas and deeper into the venerated composer’s philosophical leanings and overall approach to living. In a contemplative message that Broderick sent to his label Erased Tapes upon handing in the finished record, he explained that he was particularly drawn to the way Cage stripped his music of a composer’s presence. In like-minded fashion, Broderick set out to remove himself from Partners. That he fails to do so ends up being one of this album’s greatest triumphs.In Broderick’s own bio, he declares his love for all living things “from donkeys to dandelions” and then switches in an instant from a goofy romanticism to the sublime. Over a discography that ranges from piano, to minimalist drone scores for film, to singer-songwriter folk (along with a heap of accompanist\\/session credits), Broderick wears his heart on his sleeve, even in his instrumental work. Had he succeeded to remove himself from these pieces, Partners would no doubt have ended up as a more remote, perhaps impenetrable work of solo piano. But unlike Cage’s more radical subversions of conventional definitions of music, his “In a Landscape” disarms you with its simplicity and warmth. Those qualities provide the perfect space for Broderick’s sensitivity to shine through in his playing. The first real piece on the program is Broderick’s own rendition of “In a Landscape.” Faithful to Cage’s original instructions, Broderick keeps his foot on the sustain pedal the whole time, while a cloud of natural reverb creates the acoustic ambiance of a conservatory music hall. One can nitpick this rendition against Stephen Drury’s quintessential recording , but that would defeat the purpose. Broderick nails the lyricism and flow at the piece’s spiritual center and brings a sense of pathos that casts “In a Landscape” as more than the Satie-influenced backdrop Cage envisioned it as.Broderick may sound like a lovestruck stoner fresh out of Asian philosophy class in his spoken-word album intro, but what follows resounds with genuine adult heartache. He works through four original compositions, breaking up the solo-piano format with his own singing, chanting, and discreet touches of post-production, while still keeping the piano center stage throughout. He even riffs on Cage’s “Landscape” motif several pieces later on “Up Niek Mountain.” By then, you’re in a rather different terrain from where the music started, yet you may not notice because Broderick has shown such mastery of temperance and consistency. When he gets to the final tune, a cover of Irish folk singer Brigid Mae Power’s “Sometimes,” Broderick lets his hair down and breaks the mood after such a long spell of controlled stillness.First, in a nod to the floppy-eared exterior of the title track, Broderick stops himself after a false start and says, “Dang, it! I’m gettin’ nitpicky.” Then, over a stately, bittersweet piano melody, he performs the album’s only bona-fide lead vocal: “Sometimes,” he sings, “I just want to collapse into you\\/But I don’t know if you want me to.” His voice croaks, clearly privileging emotion over perfection. In just about anyone else's hands, such naked earnestness would verge on embarrassing. In Broderick’s, it’s a knockout punch to an already gripping body of music and a fitting last word that cements this album not just as a heartfelt expression of love for John Cage, but for love itself. \"],[22258,\"The fad of the saxophone quartet began in Europe during the early 20th-century classical scene. But it was in 1970s America that startling new concepts for all-saxophone groups started to appear with regularity. Often the players ignored the standard configuration of soprano, alto, tenor and baritone saxes. In 1977, Art Ensemble of Chicago co-founder Roscoe Mitchell put together an all-alto sax quartet to perform his ferocious, atonal piece “Nonaah.” Around the same time, bands such as Rova and the World Saxophone Quartet were using the instrument’s swing legacy to craft styles that could slip between jazz and classical categories.Battle Trance takes advantage of the possibilities opened up by those pioneers. In 2014, Travis Laplante’s tenor sax ensemble made its recording debut on the contemporary classical New Amsterdam label. Palace Of Wind showed that Laplante had the compositional chops to keep a three-movement, 40-minute piece lively. Just as crucially, he had partners who displayed crisp command of his ideas. Matthew Nelson, Jeremy Viner, and Patrick Breiner collaborated with Laplante on fast-repeating minimalist oscillations, sustained drones, as well as some charming melodic lines. Laplante cited classical music, avant-garde jazz and black metal as influences—and backed it up with timbres varied enough to make good on those claims.On the follow-up, Laplante doesn’t try to set any world records for group-saxophone intensity. Blade of Love, comprised of three movements, often has a quieter feel than Palace—though it doesn’t stint on idiosyncrasy, either. A few minutes into the first movement, the group members sing notes through their instruments. As far as “extended techniques” in saxophone performance go, this isn’t a groundbreaking trope, but its use contrasts nicely with the thick, reedy blocks of sound that open the album.Over time, each player stops singing and begins producing notes through the mouthpiece once again. After the first member makes the switch, you can tell what’s going to happen: The staggered return to “regular” playing is going to feel triumphant, once everyone is back on the riff. But despite its obviousness, this simple concept has a subtle beauty as it unfolds. Once all four saxophonists have made a return journey to more standard note-production, some of the players delight in expressive, bluesy lines that swing around the more manically pulsing parts. This joyful section of the piece eventually transitions to a section of searing drone, and then a mournful coda. The second movement adds more unexpected sounds to the mix: Pops of the players’ lips, whistles and smacks of air are all pushed around through the saxophones’ metal bodies. Again, this is a setup for a path toward a more traditional sound, which eventually comes in the form of a bracing and soulful theme. The third movement is the shortest, and its initial, mellow rounds of chanted tones are probably the closest that any saxophone group has come to the sound of early devotional music. This time, the inevitable transition from vocalizations to near-unison saxophone shredding doesn’t carry quite the same charge. But on the whole, Blade Of Love shows that there’s plenty of sax-quartet innovation left for these artists to explore.\"],[22211,\"Toronto singer and rapper Tory Lanez has his eyes fixed on mega stardom. “My name is Daystar Peterson. One day I’ma be the biggest artist in the whole world,” he says casually in the opening moments of his debut album, I Told You. But for now, he isn’t even the biggest artist in his own city. Lanez is among a group of Toronto artists trying to escape Drake’s long shadow through emulation. He has been pestering the OVO boss in an attempt to get his attention and by extension, the world’s, and Drake eventually gave him half a bar on the Meek Mill diss “Summer Sixteen” with a dig at the so-called \\\\\"New Toronto,\\\\\" the class of up-and-comers molded in Drake’s image.This shot, in a way, legitimized Lanez as a Drake adversary or at least a potential Drake understudy, and Lanez has since produced a platinum single, the Brownstone-sampling “Say It.” In Lanez’s mind, these constitute huge stepping stones in his career, one that started when he was kicked out of his grandmother’s house. I Told You chronicles this journey, relying heavily on skits and an out-of-body Menace II Society-esque narration ploy to tell its story, which basically is a long-winded build to (as its title implies) force-feeding doubters crow, cycling through several iterations of Drake in the process. As a title, I Told You isn’t a far cry from Thank Me Later.To be clear, Tory Lanez will never be Drake. He doesn’t have the knack for hooks, he isn’t better at writing raps than the Drake brain trust (or at making songs, for that matter), and he has a much tougher time finding the right rapping to singing ratio. But that doesn’t stop him from trying to remake Take Care on his debut. Some songs smolder into other attached songs, like “I Told You \\/ Another One” and “Dirty Money.” Others try to dole out that patented half-sung rapping that has become a Drake staple. And “Loners Blvd” is a straight up “Look What You’ve Done” knockoff in both intent and tone. There are even samples of “We’ll Be Fine” in “4am Flex” and “Friends With Benefits.” Give Lanez credit, though: He has succeeded where several others have failed in playing Drake’s game (politicking in interviews but waging a war of subliminals) and existing in his world and sonic space (c.f. the robbery he pulled on his version of “Controlla” or his play for world audiences with the dancehall-flecked single “Luv.”) In a post-VIEWS universe, it isn’t impossible to imagine a scenario where Lanez cuts the distance between them.Over the last few years, Tory Lanez has grown into a relatively versatile artist, a better singer than rapper, but decent at both. I Told You is a sonic variety pack compared to his last two mixtapes The New Toronto and Chixtape 3, both of which tried to split his sound cleanly down the middle. His debut is an introduction not only to his story, but to his full skill set. He isn’t a particularly quotable rapper, but he strings together some interesting cadences on “To D.R.E.A.M.,” which, in the narrative flow, functions as his “Backseat Freestyle.” His falsetto slips into the melting guitar licks on “Guns and Roses,” a song that toys with a simple but effective ‘love is war’ metaphor. “Cold Hard Love” is like putting songs from two different Weeknd eras together at the seams, and it’s an intoxicating brew of atmosphere-warping R&B and pop zip.The longer I Told You runs, though, the more it unravels. It’s an overly ambitious project that attempts to shoot a movie and forgets it’s an album in the process. Sometimes in an effort to pat himself on the back, Lanez reduces songs to plot points in his own myth-making. He could’ve shaved at least 10 minutes off the 76-minute runtime just by cutting the fat. He suffers from Travis Scott Syndrome: the tendency to overdo. Songs don’t always need big second acts or elaborate arrangements. Sometimes, less is more. “Flex,” a song almost entirely made of hooks, is two hooks too long. “4am Flex” could’ve done without the rapped outro. Everything doesn’t need a skit. Some songs here are hastily penned with only exposition in mind like a pivot moment in the Fox industry drama “Empire.” Others are jammed in completely ignoring the flow of the album, making room where there isn’t any through dialogue or soliloquy. It’s also ironic that an album this long somehow rushes the ending; the climax of his rags-to-riches yarn is fumbled in a frenzy of singles. Tory Lanez is a promising talent who has a long way to go before he can be considered Drake’s peer, but he’s already nailed at least one Drake-ism: the bloated, overwrought album.\"],[22223,\"What happens when you devise a song so unlike your signature sound that it borders on parody? And what if it’s one of the liveliest tracks on your album? If you’re Brendan Canning, of Broken Social Scene, you openly acknowledge your point of inspiration in the lyrics. The song in question is a jammy number called “Hey Marika, Get Born,” in which the title character does not listen to the Grateful Dead. The song itself sounds a lot like the band he name-checks, regardless of whether or not Marika ever listened to them. It’s a fun moment, but not one Canning commits to entirely, and it ends up being cute, rather than insightful. There are some solid songs on Home Wrecking Years, Canning’s third solo outing beyond the comfortable crowd of Broken Social Scene. The album captures the sound of a huge group of people having fun together (even if it’s a different huge group than we’re used to), but it doesn’t make the statement that solo albums usually attempt to make, as Canning’s previous two solo albums did. His first—2008’s Something for All of Us …—crackled with an immediacy that felt like he had something to say and something to prove. His second, 2013’s You Gots 2 Chill, seemed to have even more of an air of spontaneity and adventure. (It featured two guitar pieces recorded on voicemail.)But Home Wrecking Years feels like a guy just filling in the downtime before he gets back to work with his main band. Canning’s approach is playful, but not very meaningful. When the songs don’t sound like they would have been more at home on the long-awaited BSS album, they sound like tentative experiments at aping other bands’ styles. “Once I Was a Runner” paraphrases James Brown in an incongruous way. “Keystone Dealers,” the album’s second single, could be the long-awaited third entry on your “People from the Northern Hemisphere Doing Passable Songs with What Seems to be a Casio-Based Bossa Nova Beat” playlist. “Work Out in the Wash” has a solo that Canning openly acknowledges is a “slick eight-bar late ’70s George Benson-ish guitar solo.” And the final song on the album, “Baby’s Going Her Own Way,” sounds like it could be a gentle deep cut from a Luna album that came out after you stopped listening to Luna.As with his debut, a couple of BSS members make their way into the army of players here, including Justin Peroff, who plays drums on the entire album, and Sam Goldberg, who plays guitar on “Vibration Walls.” On their most recent summer shows, Broken Social Scene put “Book It to Fresno,” the very BSS-ish wall-of-fuzz single from Home Wrecking Years, on their setlists because Canning isn’t planning on touring solo. In a press release, Canning called the live version “pretty shit-kicking... which felt wonderful.”It was indeed a shit-kicking version—as is the album take. Still, the whole Home Wrecking Years project seems like Canning has arrived at a photographer’s studio in a reliable old outfit, before shyly dressing up in wacky costumes, and then taking them off immediately after the photo is snapped because he doesn’t feel comfortable in the borrowed clothing. If somebody in Canning’s party had told him that the period-specific hat and goofy scarf looked good, he might have felt the rush of possibility. But at least, with Home Wrecking Years, Canning has archived that he had the nerve to try something on that was way out of character—even if it was just for kicks.\"],[22276,\"Charlotte Day Wilson was the satin surface in the “smooth-ass R&B” Toronto quartet The Wayo. Her low voice draped around their suave arrangements just like Sade’s around her group of smooth operators. A smoldering guest spot on BADBADNOTGOOD’s recent ’70s jukebox number “In Your Eyes” made her credentials as a warden of the old school all the more official. But her debut solo EP, the mainly self-produced CDW, shoots ahead a couple decades to a more polished, contemporary adult sound. With Sade still a touchpoint—as well as Maxwell’s stylish neo-soul and some pre-“Heartbreaker” Mariah Carey sprinkled in too—Wilson’s quiet storm whirls with similar magic.Only, the opener “On Your Own” is a bit of a red herring. The short, freeform piece is a soundscape built on futuristic keys and Vangelis-esque ambience. Words are hard to make out, but the atmospherics spark as Wilson’s voice emerges on the horizon. It’s not until the blurry ballad “Work” where you hear how well her woozy production and voice work together. Her musings are vague, and her thoughts are scattered, as she quietly sings, “It’s going to take a little time but with you by my side\\/I won’t let go ‘til I’ve got what’s mine.” The familiar feelings of relationship anxiety come through clear as a crystal tumbler.With a chorus that soars, “Find You” is the nearest thing CDW has to a brash pop number that stays inside Wilson’s dapper parameters. The EP’s high point, though, might be “Where Do You Go.” Produced by rising star River Tiber—the only person other than Wilson invited to jump behind the boards—the horns and basement club jazz underpin a feeling of loneliness and isolation as the singer ponders the whereabouts of her missing-in-action lover: “Where did you go today?\\/It could have been anywhere.” Her voice doesn’t just sound great on the ear; it carries a huge emotional weight.The one thing missing is friction. A longer release would have benefitted from one or two more muscular productions, or some stylistic shifts to keep you guessing. But even without some extra force pressing down, these six tracks show Wilson has already mastered her strengths. The smooth-as-hell Canadian’s got the voice and a lot more besides. CDW funnels timeless sounds through her own distinct filter, making songs for doomed lovers sitting alone in a dimly lit living room over a bottomless bottle of cheap bourbon. \"],[22237,\"The quotes in the title are striking. Intimating a description as well as a headline, the punctuation marks are an essential part of the title of Tokyo Black Star’s second album, “Fantasy Live 1999.” They serve as an aspirational signpost for the artists, and a note of caution to those diving into their illusionary composition. Beyond the meta gates of those quotation marks, “Fantasy Live 1999” both reaffirms and moves beyond its deceptive title, playing around with what the piece is and what it isn’t. The album is, in fact, a fantasia that exists amid extended-length masterworks such as Manuel Gottsching’s E2-E4 or Lindstrøm’s Where You Go I Go Too; the analog-gear live sets currently practiced by the likes of Magic Mountain High, Reagenz, and Blondes; and the dub-wise synthesizer music of global sprites such as Francis Bebey and the Yellow Magic Orchestra. In actual terms, it is a single, multi-part, instrumental “piece” constructed in the studio by Tokyo Black Star—long-time production partners Alex Prat (better known by his DJ name, Alex From Tokyo) and Isao Kumano (a Tokyo-based sound engineer, who is one of Japan dance music's most sought-after mastering pros), and a relatively new arrival, the modular synth wiz and bassist Kenichi Takagi. It runs a cool 40 minutes at a stately disco tempo, and as the title suggests, is a modern attempt to recreate a long-lost live session that Alex and Isao performed at a Shimokitazawa club back when they were starting and raving. It succeeds in spirit and in content, and thus spends as much time gazing back longingly as it does reaching forward.TBS’s push and pull with the aesthetics of futurism—real, faux, beat-wise, ambient, contemporary, nostalgic—have been near their core from the get-go. Alex and Isao’s debut release was also the first record put out by Innervisions, the Âme- and Dixon-founded German label and crew whose house, techno and related materials have balanced underground quality and commercial popularity since inception. That 2005 EP, Psyche Dance, included a “beatless” version of a track, and set an important example for both artist and label: the pulsing qualities of synth chords and the oscillations of an analog synth’s sample-and-hold circuits made for a more Zen, less hedonistic approach to the art of the dance track. This laidback approach to the beat was hardly a new idea (it’s been a major ingredient of much great techno coming out of Japan for years), but in TBS’s music, it is especially intuitive, an unforced part of the group’s creative personality.You can hear this relaxed comfort throughout the new recording, a large reason why “Fantasy Live 1999” feels so joyous. Beyond the clever title and the running time, nothing here carries much pretense; instead, like the intrinsically Japanese, post-Murakami cut-up sleeve art by Tomokazu Matsuyama, there’s a constant playfulness. At its heart, this is music for popping the balloon of life’s seriousness, for effortlessly dancing from one knowing smile to another.The precedent is set at the top, where sci-fi sound effects and a synth run performed with classically trained dexterity create a B-movie atmosphere, while a rudimentary snare-and-kick boom-thwack completes the Kraftwerk-ian moment. Five minutes in—as the spacey synth chords reminiscent of the John Carpenter soundtracks drift by—the modus operandi of “Fantasy Live” as a journey to the past becomes abundantly clear. As soon as the chords mix down into an ambient string accompaniment for a minimal drum-machine-and-bass-synth foundation, the path is beyond doubt. Big-screen elegance slides in beside art-house kitsch—including a stretch (around the 25th minute) that can only be described as the suite’s Far East Dub moment, where koto and gamelan spirits invade the kick-drum world—co-existing naturally and maturely, and not as quirky juxtapositions.The piece builds to a grand finale whose main elements come from “Mitokomon,” the standout from Edo Express, TBS’s 2015 EP. On its own, the track—a magnificent synth skank with some lightly sprinkled African percussion—seemed a glorious accident. Yet as the closing section of a wide-ranging “fantasy,” whose elements had been forecast throughout the piece, it is a groovy overture; the sonic references now full of inferred meaning about global movement, technology and rhythm. It’s a broadly satisfying ending, the kind of exclamation point that a great set of quotes richly deserves.\"],[22273,\"The Sharon Jones survivor story is well-known to her loving fans: Jones beat pancreatic cancer in 2013 and circumvented the music industry more than a dozen years earlier. She’s never been short on insight or frankness when confronting those matters, as seen at the 2014 EMP Pop Conference keynote panel and her recent appearance on Billboard's Soul Sisters podcast. The documentary Miss Sharon Jones!, directed by two-time Oscar winner Barbara Kopple (Harlan County, USA; American Dream), is an unflinching verite account of both those fights. It’s a must-see for fans, but also an insightful intro for neophytes who’ve only heard the Dap-Kings on Amy Winehouse records.So what do those neophytes get when they pick up the soundtrack? It’s odd to categorize the release outside the context of the film itself. This isn’t quite a Greatest Hits, and if it were, there’d be plenty of omissions worth griping about: no “Stranded in Your Love,” no cover of “This Land Is Your Land,” no appearance of the debut Daptone single “Got a Thing on My Mind” or anything else from her name-making 2002 debut Dap-Dippin’ With...? But burdening the album with those kinds of gripes is mostly a matter of unfair expectations. A bigger question is why the Miss Sharon Jones! soundtrack doesn't take advantage any of the live performances that appear in the film. With a reputation earned in part due to her F-5 tornado stage presence, that’s a big letdown.But it’s damn near impossible to put together even a mediocre Sharon Jones compilation, and the soundtrack looks at her career from a unique angle. As a kiss-off to a no-good man retrofitted to her defiant stand against her disease, “Retreat!” belongs at the top of the tracklist. It’s become an anthem that embodies what she and the Dap-Kings do in the face of turmoil—and may very well be, after all this time, her signature song. The film also seems to posit 2007’s 100 Days, 100 Nights as Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings’ signature album, with five of its 10 songs (including the Motown-inflected “Tell Me,” the Etta James-ian soul-blues of “Let Them Knock,” and the slinky title cut) making up nearly a third of this soundtrack. And cuts from succeeding albums I Learned the Hard Way and Give the People What They Want round things out, making Miss Sharon Jones! more of a synopsis of her and her band’s last 10 years than the deeper examination fans might hope for.Yet despite the tunnel-vision tracklist that relies too much on the movie’s narrative, there are a couple surprise gems lurking in this collection. “Longer & Stronger,” lifted from another soundtrack (2010’s For Colored Girls), is a Southern soul ballad that reveals Jones’ resilience against the bullshit, even before she faced her health issues. Hearing her testify that “Longer and stronger, that’s how I live\\/The more I get, the more I got to give” is all the evidence you need. And the closer “I’m Still Here,” newly recorded for the soundtrack, is the autobiographical soul of the album that ties in her upbringing, her struggles, and her perseverance into the force she’s become today. Naturally, its brassy arrangement and Jones’ enduring voice make for one of the most vibrant and energizing tracks on the album, and maybe the group’s entire catalog. It’s a vital primer for those who haven’t familiarized themselves with Sharon Jones, and a reaffirming bolt of lightning for the fans who have.\"],[22274,\"One of Tree’s loose Soundcloud uploads from 2015, an unusually quiet year for the Chicago rapper and producer, was a song called “Pac Dilla,” inspired by “years of comparisons by writer after writer.” Tree has called Tupac a sworn influence, whereas Dilla has been his most frequent point of comparison since his breakthrough 2012 release Sunday School—sometimes, a way of implying that Tree is more distinctive as a producer than MC. His latest rapping-first project, an EP entirely produced by fellow Chicagoan I.B. Classic, proves the perceived slight may be a good punching bag for him. It makes the case for Tree-the-MC better than any of his other projects, while Classic's beats, with their soupy synths and funhouse samples, maintain the spiritual connection to Dilla.Tree’s previous rapping-only releases (most recently, last year’s Trap Genius) can lack the duck-and-weave approach the MC favors while rapping over his own more lopsided instrumentals. But I.B. Classic aligns more with Tree’s style than past collaborators. He described the producer’s role on the EP as “chauffeuring MC Tree through the upper, lower and mid-level echelons of soul trap housery.” Classic has his own flair though, favoring dusty sonics and hollow trashcan snares over Tree’s preferred Lex Luger kits. His concoctions tease out Tree’s strengths. “I fuck with I.B. Classic, man,” he chuckles at the beginning of “Couple Nights.” “Make me feel like Pac, yo.”As it turns out, Tree just sounds really good when he’s relaxed. On I.B. Tree, he rarely moves to belt out gospel-tinged melodic hooks; the mournful chorus of lead single “On Dem 4’s” is muted, crooned, and heard from afar. “Kinfolk”’s plea to “keep it plain, keep it simple” manifests itself across the entire EP; every song bends toward exhortations to remain humble, loyal, and grateful. The mantra is to stay in touch with one’s roots despite snowballing success. His talking points mirror the delivery. A particularly striking and uncharacteristic example is “Heard Nothing,” where Tree gently pulls in and out of time, fakes us out, and scales a jazzy drum cadence. You begin to wonder if he has been taking cues from his past collaborator Roc Marciano, or his elusive associate Ka. “The Plug” is comparatively fiery: Tree builds the story of a routine drug rendezvous (“Come by yourself\\/Top floor at the Palmer House\\/Make a left when you exit”), into a storm of introspection (“I put two and two together\\/Jealousy the brother\\/Matter ’fact, twin\\/Hater be the mother”), and still it’s a quiet one.With independent Chicago artists now a solidified presence in hip-hop media, message boards, and the nationwide concert circuit more than they were prior to the drill boom of 2012, there’s less pressure for MCs to prove themselves based on standards other than their own. Tree’s private quest to become the kind of rap statesman he wants to be—or at least, to keep trying new things—has led him, seemingly accidentally, what is perhaps his most rewarding release since his breakout year.\"],[22241,\"It seems reasonable now to look back on late 2012 as the Time of Mac. That fall, independent music fans en masse embraced the twinkly delights of scrub hero Mac DeMarco’s 2, opening the door for legions of low-key fiends ready to peddle their slinky, ’70s AM radio-inspired songs. Folks like Travis Bretzer, Alex Calder, and Connan Mockasin have all owed some debt to DeMarco for his role in making their music more visible and palatable. (Godfather credit goes to Ariel Pink as well.) And they won’t be the last to fall under the banner of “Brought to you by Mac.” Up next are his tourmates Mild High Club, the solo act of Alex Brettin, who is already following up last fall’s pleasant but slight debut Timeline with the significantly improved sophomore LP, Skiptracing.Timeline saw a technically-gifted artist trying his hand at new spins on various staples of the late ’60s and early ’70s: Todd Rundgren, the Zombies, Jim Croce, T. Rex. But while Brettin’s ability to imitate was impressive, his vocals and personality felt muted. The results were more derivative than exciting. On the surface, Skiptracing treads much of the same nostalgic ground, with a specific focus on the tropes of sunny “Lost Weekend” era L.A. But while Brettin’s first record seemed to run through depictions of those influences like cards in a rolodex, he’s now synthesizing them together into an identity more uniquely his own. On Skiptracing, a more confident artist emerges with a fuller vision and voice.The album frontloads Brettin’s best results: the first three tracks function as a heavenly, psychedelic triptych. The eponymous opener has a slinky beat and bass line that sets the chill tone nicely. It’s embellished by periodic cowbell percussion that feels cheesy and lovely at once, and a beautiful slide guitar solo that George Harrison would appreciate. “Skiptracing” slides directly into “Homage,” which begins with some plinky DeMarco-style guitar and a baroque harpsichord before a lush, sunburst chorus emerges. “Homage” tumbles into “Cary Me Back,” which uses a circulating melody and cymbal hits to summon a bit of the “‘Til I Die” ache from the Beach Boys’ own early ’70s L.A. masterpiece, Surf’s Up.The overflowing musicality of these three tracks highlights an important point: while Mild High Club and Mac DeMarco share warm aesthetics and shit-eating “What Me Worry” grins, one place where the comparisons fall flat is the former’s interest in sound and production. This suite of tunes plays like a mini trashcan pop symphony; Brettin does an interesting job crafting elaborately layered songs that still have a sort of four-track sound. When Brettin reaches in this way, his tunes leave DeMarco at the door and instead seek the territory explored by bands like under-appreciated ’90s Brian Wilson worshippers the High Llamas.Skiptracing also draws on early ’70s jazz-rock and funk much more than its predecessor. “Tesselation” recalls Bill Withers with a slacker bent. “Kokopelli” channels ’70s jazzbos like Steve Kuhn as well as ’90s tricksters like Ween, with a guitar solo that would sound at home on that band’s classic Chocolate and Cheese. Still, while Brettin’s singing is greatly improved—lazy but more present and self-assured—his lyrics are at best inscrutable and in general lacking in substance. The album’s story apparently is meant to track some kind of mystery, but other than the instrumental track explicitly labeled “¿Whodunit?,” you’d never know from the words.More problematic is the fact that the album loses steam in its second half, with an aimless instrumental and two 30 second interludes bookending the two most forgettable tunes, “Chasing My Tail” and “Chapel Perilous.” The effect, unfortunately, is that the album just kind of drifts away, belying the strength and substance of the record’s first half. Skiptracing is a great step forward for Brettin, though, as he elevates Mild High Club from nifty disciples of DeMarco and Ariel Pink to sneaky-good purveyors of sunshine pop.\"],[22233,\"The Macro-Cymatic Visual Music Instrument is a synesthete’s dream. Built by Marielle V. Jakobsons, the device translates musical vibrations into moving images using LEDs and a shallow trough of water; as sound waves stir the illuminated liquid, a video camera picks up the play of motion and texture. The invisible is made thrillingly visible as the faintest vibrations are transformed into richly dynamic fields of fluid movement, a constant flux of shadows and highlights that would surely make 4AD designer Vaughan Oliver swoon. And while they may recall the liquid projections of the 1960s, these visuals are more than just psychedelic window dressing; by turning vibrations into visual representations, they offer hints as to the inner mechanics of sound. They return music to the physical world, to the level of math and measurement, without losing sight of abstraction, emotion, or mysticism.That idea of stripping things to their essence goes to the heart of Star Core, the Bay Area musician’s second solo album under her own name. (She used the Macro-Cymatic to create a video for the album track “White Sparks.”) Made principally with synthesizer, violin, flute, fretless electric bass, and voice, it is an album where the minutest vibrations are as expressive as the most sweeping gesture, where microtones signify at the same level as melodies. But this isn’t minimalism, really; it uses those minutiae as building blocks for a much broader musical vision, one tugged between meditative stasis and quietly ecstatic reveries.Much of Jakobsons’ work, both solo and in the duo Date Palms and other groups, has deftly balanced drones with rootsier strands of American music. Her new album continues in that direction, folding together Eastern ragas with hints of Henry Flynt’s hillbilly minimalism along with fleeting traces of blues and even doom metal. It might be the most melodic thing she’s done; she even sings here. On the opening “White Sparks,” chanted vocals invoking the sun and the moon lend to the music’s ritual feel; elsewhere, her voice adds wordless breath to shimmering harmonic fields, reinforcing the human scale of her vast desert vistas.She favors fifths and sevenths and seconds, intervals that lend themselves to powerful sensations of tension and release. Jakobsons’ melodies, like the sweeping violins of “Star Core” and “Rising Light” and the flutes of “The Beginning Is the End,” are at once deeply intuitive and faintly exotic, fusing a distant, hard-to-place longing with déjà vu. (Perhaps that déjà vu has to do with the fact that her string melodies at times sound uncannily like those of Echo and the Bunnymen; on “Star Core,” it’s as though she has stripped away the British band’s rock trappings to reveal the molten ambient core that was lurking in their music all along.) Her pulsing layers of synthesizer often recall Emeralds in full bliss-out mode, and in places, her vision of rock-based ambient music even brings to mind Hugo Largo, a woefully underrated New York band that was affiliated with Brian Eno’s Opal label in the late ’80s.Unlike drone music that draws its power from duration, stretching out to 10 or 12 or 20 minutes, Jakobsons takes a more efficient approach to trance states: These songs average around five minutes long, and the music is stronger and more potent for it. She is interested in drone less as a fait accompli than as a kind of moving target. Never static, her songs are always evolving, albeit often imperceptibly, and their outward simplicity hides their deep structural complexity. But all that heavy lifting is on Jakobsons; we listeners get to simply lie back and dissolve into the music, savoring its uniquely nuanced mood, which lands halfway between melancholy and hope. It’s an exquisite balancing act, and one that—particularly now, and particularly in America—feels like as true a musical statement as you could ask for.\"],[22248,\"To call Scott Walker’s orchestral score for Brady Corbet’s debut film The Childhood of a Leader “invasive” would be an understatement. At points, it makes the There Will Be Blood soundtrack look like A Charlie Brown Christmas. Walker is responsible for the ominous, bow-shredding string figures and obscene woodwind bleats, but the young American actor\\/director Corbet—a familiar face from Martha May Marcy Marlene, the Funny Games remake, or, perhaps, 24 — claims to have lobbied for the mix to be raised “5% louder” than the theatrical standard. This provides a glaring contrast to the movie’s largely-murmured dialogue, glacial pacing, and aggressively dim composition, which recalls the famous candlelit atmosphere of Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon done on budget. In other words, it turns out the ambitious 28-year-old filmmaker and 73-year-old avant-garde music luminary are a good pair. Corbet manages to take his film—a period piece examining the broken family life of Prescott, a fictional 9-year-old fascist dictator in the making—to the same dynamic extremes Scott Walker has favored in his music since his 1995 watershed Tilt. Often, Walker’s writing threatens to overpower the movie, building up near-absurd levels of tension at moments where there might otherwise be none: Prescott and his remote mother (Bérénice Bejo) walking woodenly to Mass, or pacing around their cavernous home in the French countryside. But elsewhere, Walker follows the script sensitively, indicating his respect for the complexity of Corbet’s vision. Piercing, stratospheric tone clusters underscore Prescott’s most destructive episodes—the film is divided into “tantrums”—as if we’re hearing the ringing in his ears. Murky tidepools of manipulated strings surge as he dreams of the brutalist, pre-WWII future he will help define (“Dream Sequence”).When that future eventually comes—in the film’s epilogue—Walker-trademarked, custom-made industrial percussion arrives (see also: The Drift's meat-slab paddywhacking, the saber-scraping and farting of 2013’s Bish Bosch, the virtuoso whip work on 2014’s Sunn O))) collaboration Soused), mimicking the mechanics of a propaganda-generating printing press. This kicks off an ambitious suite of music, one which manufactures the better part of the drama in the last ten minutes of the film, in which The Leader’s staff and public prepare for his arrival in a crowded city courtyard. Walker recapitulates all the major musical motifs from earlier in the film in distorted, vituperative snippets. Military drums stutter out of time; a slithering violin emulates an air-raid siren. It’s one of the best things Walker has released since The Drift. Like the composers this music most closely recalls (Edgard Varèse, György Ligeti, Bernard Herrmann) Walker manages to play his fully-sized orchestra like one huge, terrifying instrument here. The Childhood of a Leader is a clear high water mark for Walker in terms of instrumental writing, but it is also, in many ways, an apt extension of textural ideas Walker has explored on his past two albums—as well as in his previous scores for Leos Carax’s 1999 film Pola X and dance piece And Who Shall Go to the Ball? And What Shall Go to the Ball? Leader highlights Walker at a late-career stage of both creative abundance (this is his third release in four years) and stasis. “I just work in my own sound world now,” Walker explained to The Quietus in 2014. “I’ve established a sound world and developed certain tropes and things that I understand.” After decades of painstaking experimentation, he seems content tinker around in the same haunted toolshed for the foreseeable future. But don’t call it career-twilight complacency: Judging from the depth of vision in Leader’s half-hour of music, there's plenty of exciting possibilities left for Walker’s musical lexicon, which continues to go unused by anyone but him.\"],[22236,\"When you’ve been traveling as long as Scott Hirsch has, you know better than to expect easy revelations from the road. In the mid-’90s, the California native formed the noise band Ex-Ignota alongside his friend MC Taylor. By the end of the decade, they had broken off as the Court and Spark, an alt-country group that presaged their spiritually inclined outfit Hiss Golden Messenger. Initially, the duo was roughly split into Hirsch’s music backing Taylor’s lyrics, though it became the latter’s project over time. Hirsch took on more of a live role, and after a year of heavy Hiss touring in 2015, he moved from Brooklyn back to California, opened a studio, and started work on his debut solo album. It’s taken a long time for him to let out his voice—a cool, soulful thing filled with deep reverence for his source material, if some cynicism about the myths it’s spun.In 2013, Taylor and Hirsch teamed up with Steve Gunn for one-off collaboration Golden Gunn, which riffs on JJ Cale’s logo on the cover. This generation of pickers doesn’t hide their influences, fearing accusations of unoriginality, but foregrounds them, confidently establishing themselves as part of a trailblazing lineage. Hirsch is especially overt in this respect, referencing Cale in “Blue Rider” (“they call me the breeze”), and the “weed, whites, and wine” of Little Feat’s “Willin’” on “Sundown Highway,” influences than manifest deeper in the music. His guitar choogles closer to Lowell George’s “Honest Man” than any Little Feat staples, and channels Cale’s spry equanimity and rickety drum machines. (Given Hirsch’s canonical approach, it’s also probably no accident that Blue Rider Songs arrives through a Tulsa label, Scissor Tail.) Like Phil Cook (pulling organ duties here), Hirsch finds ways of enlivening tradition, dusting on spacey synths to spotlight country funk and dub’s common rhythms, and injecting soulful vocal harmonies to lift the gorgeous, humid atmosphere.Over the past year, several of Hirsch’s peers have been out searching for meaning on America’s interstates. Cook’s Southland Mission fled to remember the value of belonging, while Gunn’s oblique Eyes on the Lines reflected Walt Whitman’s admiration in “Song of the Open Road,” “You express me better than I can express myself.” Just as William Tyler’s Modern Country surveyed the margins, warning against forgetting the “cultural geography of this vanishing America,” Hirsch’s Blue Rider Songs also veers from the beaten track. It steers onto the “blue highways” described in travel writer William Least Heat-Moon’s 1982 memoir as the periods at dawn and dusk “when the opening road is a beckoning, a strangeness, a place where a man can lose himself.” Hirsch’s narrator is lost, seemingly exiled, but it’s not the kind of self-indulgent searching where he expects to be handed a pearl somewhere along the line.He sets his compass on “Loss of Forgetfulness,” gently establishing the self-deceit of those who believe in free will while clinging tight to symbols that seem heaven-sent. Hirsch’s tone is never admonishing, the communal backing harmonies and horizontal groove doubling up as a kind of reassurance: Who wouldn’t want to believe in self-determination while holding out hope that some greater power could come and clean up our messes? But Hirsch knows that the hard work is all his to do, and ventures out into a landscape saturated by pink light, gold houses, and purple diamond suns. Men are “shitty diamonds, cut from the earth” who have to be sent out “to find their worth,” on “The Sun Comes Up a Purple Diamond,” a reprisal of an understated Golden Gunn song that he turns into a soulful romp coated in rusty shimmer.Although everything here sounds familiar in one way or another, Hirsch has a finely tuned ear: the harmonica on “Sundown Highway” flares like distant coyote calls, and spare centerpiece “Raga of the Sea” distills the moment where loss makes its gravity known. “Who thought this would be easy?” he asks amid luxurious peals of guitar on “We Took Back Roads (Blue Highways).” “It’s a heavy weight.” On Blue Rider Songs, Hirsch debunks the idea that redemption is ever a cakewalk, and finds something more truthful and lasting in the pursuit of accepting responsibility.\"],[22242,\"Morgan Delt’s 2014 self-titled record was an unexpected melange of power pop and druggy, psychedelic experimentation—a rougher, more unhinged successor to the beloved, defunct ’60s loving Elephant 6 outfits Olivia Tremor Control and Circulatory System. It wasn’t a perfect record and had a number of rough stretches, but it delivered a powerful and pleasant weirdness. Phase Zero, Delt’s second album, seems like an appropriate title, because while he’s not exactly starting over, he appears to be doing a bit of an identity reset. Having jumped from Trouble in Mind to the larger and better-serviced Sub Pop, he’s jettisoned that strangeness, and in its place is a more well-realized psych-pop album, with perhaps better songwriting but less charm.In terms of resetting expectations, Phase Zero begins with its most extreme case. Opener “I Don’t Wanna See What’s Happening Outside” is so clean and pokey that it's almost jarring. Gone are the fuzzy sound channels bleeding into one another, as well as the strange samples, jumpstart pacing, and in place is a tight and hygenic pop song with clearly audible vocals. Delt still sings in a hushed, enigmatic tone, but in comparison to his debut it’s remarkably tame.Thankfully, the record loosens up a bit from there. “Another Person” offers a better example of “clean” Morgan Delt, spiffed-up but not sanitized. “Sun Powers” and “Mssr. Monster” maintain the wild tempo and volume shifts of his earlier work, as well as some of the sound burbles Delt would use to line the edges. Album closer “Some Sunsick Day” is an excellent '60s pop song, one that showcases Delt’s attention to craft without erasing his personality. Sometimes what seems like a forward move turns out to be a lateral one, and right now it's an open question whether Delt’s more professional environs were preferable to his messy charm.\"],[22239,\"Jazz-rap collaborations mostly happen at the spot where both genre's mainstreams overlap. Guru's Jazzmatazz series tapped the talents of one-time Billboard-charting trumpeter Donald Byrd. Herbie Hancock approached Grandmixer.DST for the scratches on “Rockit” well after the keyboardist had settled into his populist, funk-fusion period. The same tends to hold true today, as when Kendrick Lamar chooses improvisers who have already proved their expertise with incorporating R&B flourishes.Much less familiar is the sight of left-field rappers experimenting with artists from jazz's avant-garde scene. One artist who's been an exception to this rule is HPrizm—the rapper formerly known as High Priest, from Antipop Consortium. In 2003, Antipop recorded with the blazingly talented pianist Matthew Shipp. Their partnership was notable for its boldness, though the album is more a curiosity than a highlight (in both catalogues). HPrizm’s latest foray into hybrid-genre adventurism easily stands with the most successful jazz-rap crossover efforts of years and decades past. Part of what makes this new project work is the fact that it’s not merely a meeting between one rapper and one jazz artist. Going by the name Sélébéyone—a word for “intersection” in Senegal’s Wolof language—this ensemble contains two different emcees who hail from different continents, as well as two composer-saxophonists, and three other valuable supporting players with strong pedigrees in jazz. What they come up with feels both legitimately new and surprisingly approachable.The two saxophonists who share composition duties on this group’s self-titled debut are altoist Steve Lehman (the nominal session leader) and his onetime student Maciek Lasserre (who plays soprano saxophone). Lehman is already celebrated in jazz circles for his complex rhythm switches and a taste for experimental harmonies. And while his tunes on Sélébéyone occasionally showcase these attributes, those characteristics have been mixed so well into the collective’s sound that they don’t call too much attention to themselves. Despite all the wild change-ups on a track like “Are You In Peace?,” the air of abandon and possibility is due to its fresh take on the posse cut: one in which the jazz solos are positioned as equal to the verses, and in which electronic sampling bolsters instrumental bridges. It’s possible to pick it all apart and figure out who’s doing what, but the surfeit of talent is just as easily enjoyed on its own.On this and several other cuts, Senegalese rapper Gaston Bandimic shares vocal duties. He’s a revelation: When he isn't raising the entire group's energy level during hype-man verses, Bandimic’s lyrics often orbit around topics of social-humanist concern, as well as the emcee’s Sufi practice of Islam. His lines from the album (as well as HPrizm’s) are presented in English on Lehman’s site, though a listener won’t need a line by line accounting of the bars spit in Wolof to appreciate the way that Bandimic throttles between a staccato flow and more fluid passages. As he’s demonstrated in his solo music, Bandimic can also carry a tune—a skill he shows off on the slinky minor-mode conclusion of “Dualism,” where he duets with Lasserre’s soprano horn. The rapper’s sensitivity to pitch is also in evidence during more uptempo moments, as with the exciting closing minutes of frenetic album finale “Bamba.”Amid Bandimic’s onslaught of approaches, HPrizm more than holds his own. He threads fast passages through “Hybrid” (“No imagination, only my real life \\/ Pulse over drums, hope to show what it feels like”). He offers a thrilling, predominantly a cappella introduction to “Dualism.” And during “Laamb,” the album’s slowly evolving opening track, HPrizm stretches his line breaks, creating unpredictable syllable stresses in a verse about the psychological tolls exacted by political inequality. (“Jewels I find\\/Under three-fourths water\\/From flooded streets I was brought up\\/Now in this era facing the ramifications\\/Of blocks to the occupation\\/As bars over propaganda\\/They criminalize the victim\\/Then the truth sets in.”) The rhythmic structure that Lehman uses for “Laamb” matches the lyrics—as a steadily marching piano ostinato gradually makes room for polyrhythms, and eventually some graceful accompaniment from his saxophone.Though its members don’t have much solo space, the rhythm section is critical to Sélébéyone’s excellence. As a veteran of keyboardist Robert Glasper’s earliest explorations of Dilla’s legacy, drummer Damion Reid knows how to drive rap-influenced jazz performance—and he’s never sounded more excited than he does here. The varied qualities of tracks like “Origine” and “Cognition” show his ability to move from energetic swing to subtler support. And he fosters joyous head-nod vibes during more consistently burning tracks like “Akap” and “Hybrid.” Perhaps the most convincing mark of this group’s confidence is their understanding that, collectively, they have more skills than can be put to use in every single song. On some tracks, the celebrated saxophonists appear not at all with their main axes (instead focusing on composing or sampling). Bandimic rhymes alone on select cuts. This wise restraint makes the full-ensemble performances hit with the force they deserve. And the variance also helps pace an album that might otherwise have become overstuffed. Over its 41 minutes, Sélébéyone walks the fine line stretched between fusion’s twin perils—too much accommodation of preexisting tastes the one side, too much invention on the other—and makes the unusual triumph look easy.\"],[22174,\"Stevie Wonder’s legacy ranks among the most powerful in pop music, though his story remains elusive. His songwriting and his voice echo through virtually all R&B-related sounds that have followed him, from Michael Jackson to R. Kelly to Kanye West, yet there is no major biography, no documentary, nothing that presents the full sweep of the most dominant and defining artist of the 1970s. And make no mistake—it was an era of superstar acts and chart-busting albums, but no one was as universally loved, respected, and honored as he was.To be sure, Wonder has done himself no favors in getting his story told. Long ago, the media figured out that his world runs on “Stevie Time,” that schedules and deadlines don’t apply to this towering genius, whether that means showing up for an interview or delivering an album.“You set a goal in your mind,” he told me in 2005, when the record A Time to Love was released after many years’ delay, “and you say, O.K., this is what these songs need to have, this project needs to have, and you don't really settle for anything less than that.” As good as his word, Wonder has not put out a new album since. But even Stevie Wonder realized that there was one project of his that demanded to be recognized and appreciated while he was still able, and in 2014 he mounted a tour to present, in full, his 1976 magnum opus Songs in the Key of Life, which turns 40 next month. The album—two LPs plus an additional four-song EP—was the culmination of a historic period of creativity, a concentrated burst of music matched only by a handful of artists (mid-’60s Bob Dylan, early ’70s Rolling Stones, ’80s Prince). Its ambition and scope were unprecedented, its power and resonance were timeless—and when it was done, he never approached its caliber or impact again.In 1971, a decade into an already-legendary career, Wonder celebrated his 21st birthday by allowing his contract with Motown Records to expire, holding out for a new deal which gave him a higher royalty rate and creative control over his work. He responded with two albums in 1972, the breakthrough Music of My Mind and his first true masterwork, Talking Book. His next releases, 1973’s Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale in 1974 (which followed a serious automobile accident that left him in a coma for four days) won back-to-back Album of the Year trophies at the Grammys. Wonder not only reeled off six Top Ten hits in three years and repeatedly pioneered new frontiers in music technology (he introduced the Moog synthesizer and the sampler to the public), he also established himself as a leading voice of social protest with such profound commentaries as “Living for the City” and “You Haven’t Done Nothing.”And then came the wait. Wonder, expressing frustration with America in the aftermath of Watergate and the never-ending war in Vietnam, had started to talk about quitting the music industry and moving to Ghana to work with handicapped children. He got as far as starting to make plans for a farewell concert. Instead, though, in August of 1975, he signed a new contract with Motown—a seven-year, seven-album, $37 million agreement, the largest deal made with a recording star up to that point. Though there were murmurs about an album release later that year, Wonder first took time off, then kept adding songs to the stockpile he had amassed, then decided there was more mixing and post-production required.Two years might not seem like a long break between records now, but at the time, it was unheard of, especially from the biggest star in the game. Motown staffers printed up T-shirts that read, “We’re Almost Finished.” And when the twenty-one-song set was finally released on September 28, 1976, the promotional campaign borrowed some pages from the playbook for the previous year’s record-shattering movie Jaws, which had redefined the making and meaning of a true blockbuster.Motown flew press and everyone who had worked on the album to the Long View Farm studio in Massachusetts for the first playback and a battery of interviews with Wonder, presenting everybody with autographed copies of the album. As it made its way to record stores, Songs in the Key of Life (changed from the working title Let’s See Life the Way It Is) was everywhere you looked. I distinctly remember what a major event the release was, and I was only 10 years old at the time.Yet this was the very rare case in which there was simply no way to overhype the music. The sound drew effortlessly from funk, pop, jazz, Latin styles. Tracks ranged from the fusion groove of “Contusion” to the delicate voice-and-harp duet “If It’s Magic.”Though more than 130 musicians are listed in the credits (including such stars as Herbie Hancock, George Benson, and Minnie Riperton), Songs in the Key of Life never strays from the singular, blazing vision of one artist. The sneaky pre-chorus in “Knocks Me Off My Feet,” the transcendent, spiraling rise of “As”—hooks pile on top of hooks, tucked irresistibly and unerringly into breaks, fills, and intros, most obviously on the album’s two biggest hits, the nostalgic, swaggering “I Wish” and the shout-out to Wonder’s jazz forefathers (and mothers) “Sir Duke,” soon to take up permanent residence in the repertoire of every marching band in the country.The hat tip to Duke Ellington was significant, since in some ways Songs in the Key of Life most recalled that composer’s classic long-form works like “Black, Brown, and Beige” (or Max Roach’s Freedom Now Suite or Charles Mingus’ “Pithecanthropus Erectus”) in its attempt to portray the complete sweep of the Black American experience. The album’s opening lines—“Good morn or evening friends\\/Here’s your friendly announcer\\/I have serious news to pass on to everybody,” from the almost impossibly gorgeous “Love’s in Need of Love Today”—laid out the stakes for all that would follow.“Village Ghetto Land” spoke of the pain and indignity of poverty and homelessness. “Black Man” served as a literal history lesson, calling out examples of how all colors and cultures have contributed to global progress. “Ngiculela—Es Una Historia—I Am Singing\\\\\" soared triumphantly in Zulu, Spanish, and English, with melody easily uniting all languages. Then there were the simple celebrations of love and faith—on “Isn’t She Lovely,” the magic of birth and family—emotions shared by all, but never to be taken for granted in undervalued Black lives.The year 1976 was, of course, America’s Bicentennial year, and especially at a time of such frustration and distrust surrounding the government and the country’s institutions, U.S. residents were bombarded with stories of our history and heroics. Songs in the Key of Life functioned as a corrective, a counter-narrative, alongside such other radical, groundbreaking statements as Richard Pryor’s Bicentennial Nigger and Alex Haley’s Roots, both of which were released just a few weeks before the album.Almost everyone understood the magnitude of Wonder’s achievement, but there were some objections, mostly having to do with the length and sprawl of the record. “[I]t has no focus or coherence,” wrote Vince Aletti in a wildly mixed but mostly favorable review in Rolling Stone. “The eclecticism is rich and welcome, but the overall effect is haphazard, turning what might have been a stunning, exotic feast into a hastily organized potluck supper.” But to complain about the excess was to miss the point—any great double-album (The White Album, Exile on Main Street) could easily be edited into something tighter and more consistent, but the all-encompassing aspiration is the whole idea, the desire to contain multitudes and to cover as much ground as possible during a revved-up creative groove. Sometimes, more is more.Certainly, the public understood. Songs in the Key of Life entered the album charts at No. 1, only the third record to hit that spot straight out of the gate (after Elton John’s two previous releases). It then stayed there for the rest of the year; to understand just how ubiquitous the music of the mid-’70s could be, consider that it knocked Frampton Comes Alive! out of the No. 1 slot, and was finally bested in January of 1977 by Hotel California. Inevitably, Wonder won his third straight Album of the Year award at the Grammys (he missed the ceremony because he was visiting Nigeria at the time).After Songs in the Key of Life, though, something seemed to deflate in Stevie Wonder’s work. It was as if, at the ripe old age of 26, he was bored by the idea of just writing hit songs. His next album was 1979’s mystifying, experimental, mostly instrumental Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants, a double-album soundtrack to a documentary about the feelings of greenery and flowers. Turning his attention to the crusade for a national holiday to honor Martin Luther King, Jr., Wonder rebounded with Hotter Than July in 1980 (featuring the sublime “Master Blaster (Jammin’)),” but since then, it’s mostly been long waits in between underwhelming new records.It was like there was nowhere left to go after Songs in the Key of Life—and maybe there wasn’t. The album was more than just a masterpiece; it was the culmination of all of the potential that Stevie Wonder showed since his days as an 11-year-old prodigy. Musically, politically, culturally, it was the fulfillment of everything that Motown and the ’60s soul revolution had promised. And within a few months, disco was the focus for new Black music, while in the parks and playgrounds of the Bronx and beyond, hip-hop was taking shape for the next generation.The sound of Songs in the Key of Life never stopped reverberating. Elton John and Prince said that it was their favorite album. Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston sang its praises. Coolio, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, and Will Smith sampled its hooks. Mary J. Blige and Luther Vandross covered its songs. Kanye West said in 2005, around the release of Late Registration, “I'm not trying to compete with what's out there now. I'm really trying to compete with Innervisions and Songs in the Key of Life. It sounds musically blasphemous to say something like that, but why not set that as your bar?” Still, it was a genuine event when Stevie Wonder decided to take Songs in the Key of Life to the stage 38 years after its release, and bring the spotlight back to his greatest musical accomplishment.It required several dozen musicians on stage to recreate the album’s arrangements, with full horn and string sections (that harp!), but it also imposed a discipline on Wonder’s performance, which too frequently devolve into a mess of medleys and sing-alongs. The shows were magnificent, the words as true as ever, and there was Stevie, still telling us—showing us—that “music is a world within itself\\/With a language we all understand.” Almost four decades later, you could feel it all over.\"],[22267,\"There’s this story in The New York Times Magazine where the writer asks his subject, Jerry Seinfeld, why he still spends months on the road. The comedian, worth nearly a billion dollars, could retire with his family to a private beach somewhere; if he wanted to chase some grand artistic dreams, he could surely land an unlimited budget from any number of movie studios. Instead he tinkers away in theatres, dark clubs, and at tiny private gigs, making minor variations on jokes that sometimes take years to perfect. “The smaller something is, the harder it is to make,” Seinfeld said,  gushing over the careful click of a closing door from one of the “few dozen” Porsches he owns. He’s drawn to the arts that require precision, he explained, like calligraphy—“or samurai.”Halfway through his brief, brilliant new album, Ka sneers: “How many cars you need?” With Honor Killed the Samurai, the Brownsville craftsman cements himself as one of this generation’s preeminent stylists, his voice hushed but vicious, his production a grim rabbit hole of found sounds, minor keys, and very few drums. Beginning in earnest with 2012’s Grief Pedigree, Ka has peeled away every extraneous layer from his work, tinkering like the Porsche designer until each part fits within another just so. Now he’s arrived at its core, where each syllable is purposeful and every piano key is in its right place.And yet the genius of Ka’s music is that the form follows function. On “$,” the song where he questions how many cars one man can drive, he also raps: “Watch me blueprint rec centers\\/I’m trying to inspire.” So much of his past, his worldview, his creative style is packaged into that one couplet, be it the deserted Brooklyn of his youth, his unerring loyalty, his economy of language. It’s the sort of line that unlocks whole sections of an artist’s psyche for the audience, all in fewer than ten words. As he says earlier on the song, “Could battle hard against catalogs with one leaflet journal.”The irony of Samurai’s title is that, while the window dressing recalls feudal Japan, you rarely have to look back further than Giuliani’s New York to see the kinds of fiercely fought, morally fraught battles that rage in the background. By now, Ka’s story is well-worn—the Golden Age also-ran who walked away then, when the itch came back, locked himself in a bedroom until all the swords were sharp. He was a member of Natural Elements, a group that eventually landed on Tommy Boy but made little impact; when he resurfaced, it was in 2008 with a quietly show-stealing verse on GZA’s Pro Tools. He’s not a revivalist—in his time away he blended fury and control in a way that would be nearly unrecognizable in any era—and so his writing has an irresistibly fuzzy relationship to time.See the passage on “That Cold and Lonely” where he raps, “With no clear winner, still appeared thinner\\/Don’t howl like I’m holier than thou, I’m a mere sinner\\/Wasn’t blessed to be resting in the ‘burbs\\/I was stressing, wrestling with the scourge.” That could be an origin story or a sad denouement; either way, he “tried years for these ideas to gestate.” On “Finer Things\\/Tamahagene,” the vocal layering is both well suited to fill out the mix and mimics someone’s own paranoid self-doubt. But more importantly, Ka wrings his hands over fulfilling his vast potential: “They say it’s royal in my blood.”In the first verse of “Mourn at Night,” Ka says, simply, “My scars last.” That might be the best way to put it. Even setting aside the obvious detour his creative life took, the man’s work is littered with past moments of trauma that have, by this point, settled into his bones. The hours spent making himself one of genre’s greatest songwriters, the dollars lost to broken security deposits—they all add up to a life made for viewing through all the grimy, shattered lenses Ka has at his disposal. Because no matter how the borough shifts around him, he’s somewhere in a dark room, working and re-working the details until he gets it just right.\"],[22270,\"On the surface, Steve Hoover’s documentary Almost Holy could be a feel-good story. Its protagonist, altruistic Russian priest Gennadiy Mokhnenko, rescues and rehabilitates homeless, drug-addicted youths from the streets of the Ukraine. Judging solely by the soundtrack, though, it sounds like a horror movie. With half its songs made by brothers Leopold and Atticus Ross (the latter a partner with Trent Reznor in scoring David Fincher films) and the other half by Bobby Krlic (aka the Haxan Cloak), Almost Holy’s music is heavy, pounding, and at times purely bombastic.It turns out that Mokhnenko himself has a dark side—some reviews of Almost Holy suggest his savior tactics verge on abduction—that dovetails with all these ominous sounds. But regardless of their role in the accompanying film, the songs on Almost Holy work as worlds of their own. The producers craft dense environments with reverberating drones, soaring synths, and heartbeat-like rhythms. A few approach the melodramatic foreboding of John Carpenter. But the music of Almost Holy is less about narrative than atmosphere.That’s in keeping with both the recent soundtrack work of the Rosses and Krlic’s last effort as Haxan Cloak, which Pitchfork’s Nick Neyland called “more soundtrack than regular album.” Nobody here delivers anything unexpected, but all three play well to their strengths, which overlap significantly. The echoing, apparitional tones of Krlic’s cavernous “Pharmacies” and the brittle “Coursing” show his knack for turning alien abstractions and discordant textures into moving music. The Rosses’ contributions are more conventional but just as effective, especially “Punching Bag,” which morphs from metallic sheen into a grinding pulse, and the harrowing dissonance of “Distance.”Almost Holy only falters when it drifts toward the generic. That’s a danger with any soundtrack, since music that has to serve multiple purposes can easily get reduced to a common denominator. In opener “One Block Further,” the Rosses’ rote piano chords and default beat resemble library music filed under “dramatic techno.” But more often, conventional tropes work in the producers’ favor. Take Krlic’s closer “The End,” which plays like an obvious denouement, as rising, choir-like tones cascade into a bombed-out climax—and yet, every moment is tense and gripping. Like the rest of Almost Holy, the idea may be familiar, but the execution is compelling.\"],[22230,\"Jefre Cantu-Ledesma has described his latest work, a five-track cassette release called In Summer, as a “catalogue of photographs.” The songs are meant as snapshots of people, places, and interests he developed in 2015. It’s not an unusual thing to say about your music;  there are ways in which songs can crystallize a memory better than a photograph. Cantu-Ledesma’s work is wordless, often rhythmless, making it a strange vehicle for visuals, but In Summer somehow lives up it’s visual description, and it is possibly one of the most pastoral and emotionally evocative pieces of noise music that’s been released this year.In Summer opens up with a magnificently colorful soundscape, “Love’s Refrain,” which throws a listener into a middle of a blooming world of warm noises: hiccuping warbles, burps of noise, static that fringes the track like pieces of confetti frozen in mid-air. Unlike so much ambient music or noise, it isn’t attempting to be atmospheric or even alien—it is heated, lush, and decidedly terrestrial. The song tears itself apart as it progresses, careening into a wall of noise in its closing minutes. Susan Sontag once wrote that a photograph invited a viewer “to participate in another person’s mortality, vulnerability, mutability” and that in this experience the photograph itself testifies “to time's relentless melt;” in over seven minutes of collaged noise, Cantu-Ledesma somehow manages to convey this feeling without a single word.He reproduces it throughout In Summer with varying levels of success. In “Little Dear Isle” he smashes together found sounds (the rustling of leaves and bird calls) with a menacing drone that transforms around the two-minute mark into something crunchier, distended, and buoyant. It’s a strange contrast to the nature sounds behind it, transforming bucolic trappings into something much more sinister  Some others are less successful: The title track is predictable, a beautiful drone that suddenly takes a left turn into a minefield of dissonance. “Blue Nudes (I-IV),” the album’s longest track (over 7 minutes) is more or less a solid block of sound. It’s less evocative or visual than the album’s other songs, and is textured in a more sculptural way. For what it’s worth, Cantu-Ledesma’s makes vases and planters, that he sells on his website. They’re beautiful, colorful, purposefully imperfect, and very layered. There is something of that art present in this song. The album concludes with “Prelude,” which drops you into pure chaos. The guttural growl of a dog, an indistinct whisper, and roiling static make it one of the most alive moments in the record. It’s terrifying and wistful, and it all dissolves away in the presence of a single piano playing the same set of notes over and over again. The last thirty or so seconds are near-silence, a wonderful way to close out a record which is so much about degradation and natural processes. In Summer situates itself in a conversation about  decay and entropy, and takes a stance that is almost optimistic because it renders chaos and dissonance thoughtfully and beautifully. \"],[22169,\"Is there a harder sell than the all-drum band? It’s one thing to see a purely percussive group live and get swept up in their visual dynamic and the room’s collective energy, but listening on record demands a certain level of dedication—a need to reset your internal pulse, maybe—or just plain masochism. Undeterred by the hard sell, Nottingham’s Katharine Eira Brown and Theresa Wrigley took a break from their respective regular bands Kogumaza and Fists to unite under the onomatopoeic banner Rattle in 2011, galvanized by the demand for imagination inherent in such a project.That doesn’t mean Wrigley and Brown are big on showmanship. Their sound is sparse, exposing and exploiting the specific qualities of each drum in their kit, building up clean and agitated patterns from skittish rim taps, roiling toms, and the snare’s metallic tang. The ghostly notes that bleed from their reverberations become the starting points for their vocal melodies, as they chant fragmented lyrics that could be about an impending catastrophe and the subsequent new world order—the call to leave your homes on “Trainer (Get You)” (maybe named in tribute to Shellac drummer Todd?), their ominous observations that something’s “Starting,” the electromagnetic event of “Thunder,” and the sparsely sketched portrait of a world leader who wants to “ruin it and rule in a ruin.”Rattle doesn’t really offer any such threat to the status quo. Too many of its songs lack any sense of dynamic, shuffling around stop-start beats and wordless vocalizing that drags once you’ve realized it’s going nowhere. The duo are yet to come up with any particular spell—lacking, say, the violence of fellow Brits Shit and Shine, or the transcendent quality of Steve Reich's percussion compositions. They've also left some gaping open goals: “Starting” never actually gets off the blocks, and the clipped intonation of “Dulling” is… just that.But there are some inventive moments here. Often, Wrigley and Brown coo in the colorful looping pattern made famous by Dirty Projectors, stumbling over themselves as the excitement mounts. The addition of cabasa and vibraslap gives “Stringer Bell” a strangely danceable groove, and “True Picture” brings to mind Autolux’s Carla Azar marching to tUnE-yArDs’ beat. The duo’s sense of freedom and unwillingness to mimic the tropes of conventional songwriting are to be admired, even if they’re not necessarily traits that will convince anyone but ardent early-Reich fans that drumming records are worthy of a place on their shelf.\"],[22246,\"If you listen closely, you can hear footwork undergoing a transition that house and techno made before it: from a functional music created for dancers to a music made, at least in part, for personal expression. As with house and techno, this has resulted in tighter and more precise compositions, as producers—who have also gotten better at using their gear\\/software—are no longer rushing beats to the dance floors. If you compare DJ Rashad’s Double Cup or Jlin’s Dark Energy with the types of tracks—full of eerie ambiance and seams-showing production values—featured on the seminal Bangs & Works compilation, there is an uptick in both fidelity and personality.  The shift is apparent, too, in the work of DJ Earl, New York-based, Chicago-born member of the Teklife crew. The first set of new tracks released on Teklife’s eponymous label (the first release was a cull of Rashad’s archive), Open Your Eyes is eight tracks of knocking-but-composed footwork. Featuring several collaborations with Oneohtrix Point Never (as well as a host of footwork veterans) and artwork by OBEY founder Shepard Fairey, Open Your Eyes feels leagues away from the harsh digital productions on earlier Earl EPs like Teklife Or Nolife or Afrika Tek.Earl is still working well within the purview of footwork, offering up the kind of tempos and chopped vocal refrains you’ve come to know and love. There are vocal samples about weed, and about ass, and one about fucking shit up. Little summer storms of snare drums come in fast and hard. But Open Your Eyes is an orderly and uncluttered album, even when working at higher tempos. The vocal bits never clash or confuse; there’s space in the arrangements for synthesizers to float in and out of the mix.If you are the type of listener who generally finds footwork too manic and roughshod, Open Your Eyes may be for you. “Let’s Work,” a collaboration with Oneohtrix and MoonDoctoR, is almost elegant: a house vocal—“C’mon let’s work!”—deployed economically over electric piano and horn. (As with many collaborations in the co-operation friendly footwork world, it can be difficult to discern who is doing what, exactly.) “RacheTt” (with MoonDoctoR and OPN) threatens to whip itself into a noisy froth but stops just short. Even the more aggressive “Smoking Reggie” (again with MoondoctoR and OPN) has a kind of call-and-response logic to it, and a whinnying synth melody to anchor it.It’s hard not to notice, though, that Open Your Eyes is also somewhat conservative. It features none of the wild juxtapositions or mayhem of, say, RP Boo. It feels labored over, and it sacrifices some of the form’s early magic But there's room for this, too, and we need look no farther than Jlin to see the potential in footwork as more heavily produced, personally expressive music. DJ Earl is traveling a different road than footwork’s pioneers, and he may yet find that magic on it.\"],[22272,\"Most Sonic Youth fans know that the full band is unlikely to reunite. In recent years, those eager for new encounters with the group’s sound have made do with various members’ side projects and surprise guest appearances. (Kim Gordon and Lee Ranaldo even shared a stage at Dinosaur Jr’s 30th birthday bash.) Archived live shows and vinyl reissues of classic albums have trickled out of the band’s surviving merchandise machine. Though given how well Sonic Youth documented its prime-era productivity—with experimental EPs and imaginative collaborations showing up nearly as often as song-based albums—it’s reasonable to assume that the vaults aren’t stacked with unjustly overlooked material.The gloomy state of this lowered-expectations game means that Spinhead Sessions prompts some moderate thrills. Titled after the studio where the band rehearsed for a movie-soundtracking job, these purely instrumental pieces from 1986 offer another look at musicians who had just recorded EVOL (and who were about to write Sister). At this point, they were so locked-in that they could prove compelling during practice time.The music Sonic Youth contributed to 1987’s Made in USA was not released until 1995—that is, near the peak of the group’s major label-clout period (as well as that of the CD boom). That official soundtrack has never been mistaken for anything other than a collection of miniatures, few of which are given a chance to develop past the three-minute mark. Spinhead Sessions outdoes Made in USA merely by letting Sonic Youth be Sonic Youth. Freed from the need to provide concise film-music cues, they push a few of the spare themes created for a side-hustle gig into substantial workouts.These performances are no less subtle for their matter-of-fact titles. “Ambient Guitar and Dreamy Theme,” the 16-minute opener, stirs nervy, tremolo guitar effects and a simple melodic line into a cauldron of dread in its first half. Eventually the atmosphere calms, thanks to some lightly strummed chords. “Theme With Noise” mixes some seductive slide-guitar playing into its miasma, and “High Mesa” builds from dreamy to cathartic, led by Steve Shelley’s gradually more forceful drumming. Overall, this half hour anticipates the tossed-off mastery of EPs the band would later issue through their SYR imprint.That opening trio of cuts is the best this particular drawer in the vault has to offer. From there, Sessions tenders four shorter, less ambitious tracks. In terms of running time, this sequence pads the release out beyond EP length—though the material isn’t any more compelling than most stretches on Made in USA. Yet despite its clear status as a barrel-scraping effort, this album isn’t just for the most desperate fans. While it’s unavoidably casual in nature, the bulk of this set provides the pleasure of Sonic Youth during an era of good spirits and high creativity.\"],[22227,\"Warren Hildebrand (who makes music as Foxes in Fiction) started Orchid Tapes six years ago in an apartment in Toronto. He was still in college, and the label was essentially an ad-hoc distribution method for his 2010 debut Swung from the Branches. The label took its name from a 2007 Deerhunter song “Tape Hiss Orchid” (from Cryptograms), and fittingly the song and perhaps much of Bradford Cox’s noisy somnambulism is hardwired into the label’s DNA. Eventually he connected with artists over Myspace, and the label started to serve as a platform for cassette releases of self-described “bedroom pop.” R.L. Kelly, Elvis Depressedly, Ricky Eat Acid, Alex G, and many more found homes at Orchid Tapes, and over the course of its existence it’s become one of the most successful cassette labels. It’s succeeded because of careful curation on the part of Hildebrand and the label’s co-manager Brian Vu, who Warren met when he moved to New York a few years ago. The artists that work with Warren and Brian are quick to define the vibe of Orchid Tapes as familial and personal: Alex G even described the label as “a support group.” Two years ago, the label released its first retrospective compilation, Boring Ecstasy: The Bedroom Pop of Orchid Tapes, which perfectly summed up the melancholic and handmade love that pulsated through the music that Orchid Tapes was sharing. The songs found within were rough, immediate, and refreshing as the cool side of a pillow. In Radiating Light: Orchid Tapes & Friends, the loose sequel to Bedroom Pop, the tricks start to run thin, and the inventive eccentricities once present have started to feel as safe as a day spent perusing Etsy.  This isn’t evident at first. The opener features a newer artist on the roster, Soccer Mommy, and her contribution, “Memories,” begins with an 8-bit jingle, making the very first second’s of the compilation feel like you’re entering an arcade game. It’s tactile and attention-grabbing, and what follows is about three minutes of bedroom pop, cleverly written, confessional, sincere, but allusive. The following song, Katie Dey’s (another newer artist) “Few Hours Later,” is diverse, messy, and dense with gnarled-but-inviting sounds. These two songs alone are tantalizing, and some of the best new work that Orchid Tapes has curated.Veteran label members add equally vivid and interesting contributions to the mix. R.L. Kelly’s “Mad” is a nicely unadorned and relatable meditation on frustration and mental health. Ricky Eat Acid and Blithe Field's “It's Love” is a bittersweet and dreamy piece of electronic music. The off-kilter garage rock of Infinity Crush’s “Mirror” adds an element of bracing power to the album, and it's redolent of Mitski's recent work. Alex G’s  “July 27, 2015,” a ramshackle twee-house song, is the one moment of true risk and failed experimentation: Its lilting drum machine pitter-patter could easily fit somewhere in the world of internet house labels like 1080p. Elsewhere Radiating Light is muddled by a sense of dullness and repetition. There aren’t many risks, and unlike it’s predecessor, it doesn’t tell a story or give a solid collective artistic statement. Benoît Pioulard’s “Layette [slow version]” is a pedestrian retread of a song he already released earlier this year. A cover of Elvis Depressedly’s “Weird Honey” done by Owen Pallett and Foxes in Fiction is overwrought, busy, and saccharine. These aren't adjectives that normally orbit the kind of music these guys make. Overall, there are chunks of the compilation that feel anonymous or shapeless, yet it’s hard to hate this release: If you get one of the vinyl bundles, it comes complete with some guava candy, an Orchid Tapes tea bag, Polaroid photos, and a handwritten thank-you note. This kind of love and care that’s hard to beat. Perhaps after six years of innovating, Orchid Tapes is settling for what works. It might not make for an interesting collection of music, but there is something about Radiating Light that gives you hope: People still make magic in their apartments behind closed doors. \"],[22228,\"Ever since Jeff Buckley was claimed by the Mississippi River in 1997, an entire cottage industry has cropped up to give us greater insight into his enigmatic talent, which left behind one perfect, timeless full-length album and much speculation about what could’ve been. But now that the vaults have been thoroughly scraped for every last improvised Smiths cover, a recent online initiative invites us to get to know Buckley at the most intimate level. Over at jeffbuckleycollection.com, you can virtually thumb through his personal vinyl archive as if you were hanging out on his living-room rug with a glass of lilac wine. However, in the jump from Philip Glass to Guided by Voices, a favorite band is missing, one that Buckley praised in the pages of Rolling Stone and eagerly pitched to the radio-station programmers he encountered on the Grace promo circuit. Perhaps the absence has to do with the fact the group in question rose up in the early ’90s, and Buckley only owned their music on CD. In any event, the oversight is all too appropriate—after all, the Grifters are used to being left out of canons.The Grifters were the sort of group your record-store clerk would recommend if they saw you walking up to the register with a copy of Slanted and Enchanted or Bee Thousand—a band for braver souls willing to dig deeper into the dirt. They were, in many respects, a typical ’90s indie-rock act. Their sound was a Memphis-brewed melange of overlapping aesthetics: the fuzz-blasted melodicism of Guided by Voices, the crooked hooks of Pavement, the hoot ‘n’ holler hysterics of Jon Spencer, the dirty-needle boogie of Royal Trux. But at the center of that Venn diagram, the Grifters staked their own uncharted turf: a post-modernist, pulp-fictional universe populated by cool jerks, mambo kings, dragon ladies, and other mysteries. Even at their most ferocious, the Grifters carried themselves with an air of Rat Pack sophistication—their cryptic songs sounded like smart conversations you wished you could contribute to and inside jokes you wanted to be let it on. This is a band whose idea of an opening line is “Well, I swear, I never meant to leave you tied up to a train”—and their peculiar personality is perfectly encapsulated by that discomfiting mix of callousness and concern.The Grifters weren’t exactly obscure in their day—beyond Buckley’s vocal endorsements, their records were reviewed in all the major music mags (leading to a two-album run on Sub Pop), and their association with Memphis’ Easley McCain Recording studio helped make it an Abbey Road-esque destination for A-list indie-rockers in the ’90s. But they never crossed over to the realm of Leno appearances, 120 Minutes rotation, and Calvin Klein ads like those aforementioned peers. As such, the Grifters don’t really have a legacy today, probably because their music is too scrambled and combustible to easily imitate. Their impact is felt most acutely close to home: In Memphis outsider-rock lore, the Grifters are the spiritual link between Big Star and Goner Records. Tellingly, their recent, sporadic spate of reunion dates was prompted by their participation in the 2013 documentary Meanwhile in Memphis: Sound of a Revolution. And, in keeping with that regional focus, some of the band’s pre-Sub Pop catalogue is now being brought back to market via Mississippi’s Fat Possum Records.While 1993’s One Sock Missing thrust the Grifters to the topsoil of America’s lo-fi underground (complete with self-explanatory anthems like “She Blows Blasts of Static”), the band would carve out their own unique groove on 1994’s Crappin’ You Negative, where the battery of bassist Tripp Lamkins and drummer Stan Gallimore busted through the scuzzy surface with Zeppelin-esque might. Like Buckley, the Grifters had an unabashed affinity for the blues—a sound that had been all but vanquished from indie rock during the post-hardcore ’80s. Where Buckley channeled the blues’ eternal sadness, The Grifters adopted its slide-riff sleaziness and feral heat. But the Grifters were no blues-rock band—they were too compulsive to let their feet get stuck in that quicksand foundation.Thanks to David Shouse and Scott Taylor’s good-cop\\/bad-cop dynamic, their songs had a consistently unsettled quality, marked by duelling melodies, out-of-sync harmonies and jarring aesthetic juxtapositions. Crappin’ standouts like “Maps of the Sun,” “Get Outta That Spaceship & Fight Like a Man,” and “Holmes” may come slathered in juke-joint grease, but Shouse’s arch, Bryan Ferry-esque vocals redirect them toward the cosmos. And while Taylor sings with a more typical Midwestern twang, his manic energy steers revved-up rockers like “Black Fuel Incinerator” into fiery, at times frightening chaos.But Crappin’ You Negative’s explosive outbursts are tempered by serene lo-fi interstitials, and a pair of balladic set-pieces—the distortion-caked despair of “Felt-Tipped Over” and desolate desert twang of “Junkie Blood”—that preview the more refined songcraft Shouse would showcase in his post-Grifters band Those Bastard Souls. And as if to reward us for indulging their every whim, the Grifters’ send us off with the adrenalized, straight-ahead power-pop of “Cinnamon”, though, naturally, even this shot of sweetness is laced with poison: “fee-fee-fi-fi-fo-fum\\/I smell the blood of an Englishman.”The Grifters would go on to write more structurally sound pop songs on 1996’s Sub Pop debut Ain’t My Lookout, but Crappin’ You Negative remains the best, most bracing showcase of what made the band so strange and special: the sudden pendulum swings between class and crass, between somber, tape-hissed meditations and outrageous lounge-act theatrics, between skronky Beefheartian disintegration and arena-ready rock-outs. As the early-’90s lo-fi revolution proved, any band of Tascam amateurs can make a racket. But in its violent vacillations between rock ‘n’ roll tradition and treason, Crappin’ You Negative is a reminder that one must first know the rules of rock ‘n’ roll before you can properly break them.\"],[22245,\"Ever since A Sufi and a Killer sent his scarred wail out into a wider world, Gonjasufi’s future has seemed pretty open-ended. What path would his hip-hop-influenced psych take?  Subsequent releases—especially 2012’s MU.ZZ.LE—veered closer to a series of confrontational wake-up calls than the inner voyage of the mind than “psychedelia” typically suggests. Jay Z’s “Nickels and Dimes” might have lifted the hook from the Gonjasufi cut of the (almost) same name, but its mournfully introspective spirit was something too bare-nerved to co-opt, the catharsis of MU.ZZ.LE pared it down to just the “psych-” and laid bare just how many far more unsettling things could be attached to it as a suffix. Callus is deliberately abrasive proof of this: an album that’s disorienting at its catchiest, harrowing at its ugliest, and more than willing to run both of those modes at the same time. Gonjasufi’s described this album as a document of his effort to embrace hate and pain, not out of nihilism or defeatism but as a way to endure what he sees as a surplus of the stuff getting dumped on everybody’s heads so he can return it as love. The album title says as much—it literally suggests growing a thicker skin—and the record’s mode feels like a much-needed endurance test in turn. It’s harsh and raucous and even oppressive, despite the fact that it ventures only rarely (and briefly) into uptempo trad-aggro turf. It’s both a call for confrontation and a search of positivity.And there’s more “we” than “I” in that confrontation. Gonjasufi’s lyrics feel more than ever like they’re sung in his characteristic wobbly, mutating wail because that piercing tone is the best way to reach out to people. Entreaties like “Is anyone else tired\\/From working on a slave ship?” (from opening cut “Your Maker”), declarations that “Babylon hates me\\/And they want me killed” (“The Kill”), and demands to “Forget your story and fake glory\\/Get your devils off of me” (“The Conspiracy”) are the words of someone reckoning with his fears and traumas in public to feel less alone. “Everything’s fucked” isn’t exactly a rare sentiment this year, though, and some stress is better empathized with when it’s felt rather than spoken, so he’s still riding on a tendency to show-not-tell his through tone. There’s a lot of distortion and overblown, in-the-red bass smothering the clarity of his words—even as it boosts the intensity of the voice delivering them. (The way his breathless, fuzz-drenched repetition of “stay out” melts into a caustically dissolving analog synth is borderline horrifying.)The mood of Callus comes off as embattled and mercurial as the mindstate of anyone trying to get their shit together and find a way through. And the music, filled with reverb and fuzz and gristle and the smell of ozone, demands both your attention and your resilience. Some fuss has been made about the appearance of former Cure guitarist Pearl Thompson, who shows up a few times (heard best on “The Kill”) to grind out some fuzz-toned squalls of noise. But it’s all of a piece, with the Special Guest Star moments subsumed into a bigger wall of noise. There’s King Tubby dub bleeps echoing into the distance (“Your Maker”), lo-fi guitar sludge lodged somewhere between Neu!’s “Super 16” and the murkier reaches of early Sub Pop (“Maniac Depressant”),  industrial machine-gun synth-drums (“Afrikan Spaceship”), EWF kalimbas swamped by doom-metal bass\\/organ churns (“The Jinx”), and a bonafide modern-day goth dancefloor filler (“Vinaigrette”). The atmosphere might get oppressive, but it never feels stuck. Besides handily proving that it’s a fairly straight line from Gaslamp Killer-style acid-funk crate-digging to the grimier pages in Adrian Sherwood’s portfolio, Callus is also a healthy reminder that it takes some strikingly noisy stuff to actually hold up against his voice. Get used to it; even when it sandpapers your ears, it just makes the path to your mind that much clearer.\"],[22210,\"For nearly 20 years, the Minneapolis rapper-producer duo Atmosphere—Slug (Sean Daley) and Ant (Anthony Davis), respectively—have been trying to find a balance. The alt-sloping founders of the indie rap stable Rhymesayers have been teetering between identities as idols (to a cult-like following of passionate fans) and beleaguered hand-wringers (to everyone else). They’ve earned an “emo rap” tag by delivering plainspoken pleas in spoken-word cadences that saunter through dusty MPC loops, and they cornered the market on a specific subset of pre-internet rap by fearlessly divulging to anyone who’d listen. Slug and Ant have always functioned well as a duo because they’re in search of the same thing: shared feelings. Ant once said he’s a “sensitive fucking person” who’s “totally just about truth,” peddling his emotions through a blues-tinged soundboard, and Slug is a working class MC who shares every painstaking thought from deep in his tortured soul. But we’re now reaching the point (or maybe we’re past the point) where thinking out loud has turned the corner into over-sharing. On their latest album, Fishing Blues, Atmosphere make rap just for the sake of making it. This thing has no function or utility.Atmosphere albums haven’t been interesting (or necessary) for a few years. The two partners worked at a distance for the first time on their last one, 2014’s Southsiders, which was their second dad-rap record (following The Family Sign). Southsiders tried to sort out exactly what Atmosphere songs inspired by fatherhood and domesticity might sound like. The results were predictably lame. The ideas were overwrought, gracelessly executed, and sometimes just straight-up boring. Fishing Blues makes a lot of the same mistakes, only it’s way longer and even more uneven. This is the Atmosphere take on the vanity project where even the self-deprecation is half-assed: On “No Biggie,” Slug raps, “Take a photo with the number one loser\\/Trying to get used to living in the future.” Take that lyric at face value and it says Slug is having trouble adjusting to what’s current, which would explain some of this album’s dated choices—e.g. its lead single is called “Ringo.” But as proof this isn’t just an age or longevity problem, there’s “When the Lights Go Out,” a song that features rap veterans Kool Keith and DOOM in different roles. Both deliver admirably. DOOM gets a verse, and though it’s far from his best, it’s more than enough to stand out here. Aesop Rock, who just this year proved the adventurous Year 20 indie rap album was possible, pops up. pops up for a chanting outro, but he doesn’t get to do any serious rapping on “Chasing New York,” which he could’ve salvaged.Fishing Blues has no stakes—with or without this record, the Atmosphere legacy is cemented—and the sloppy writing, disinterested rapping, and overall conservative artistic decisions seem to reflect that. Some of the lines are bad (“We on a spaceship, crash land from above\\/We on a lazy river, fly fishing for love” from “A Long Hello”) and a lot are lazy (“She was encyclopedia thick” and “attitude of a hot bowl of cat food” from “No Biggie”). This is a tedious listen with little replay value, where the only reprieve from the droning is a laugh from a clunker.It should be noted that Slug is a very good rapper and Ant a skilled producer, so any Atmosphere record, even the most purposeless one, is bound to get it right at least some of the time, especially on a release with 18 tracks. The most gripping moments on Fishing Blues either step way outside the parameters of traditional Atmosphere, like the electro-fused “Seismic Waves,” or double down, like on “Besos,” which accents a boxy breakbeat with flutes. There are a handful of really intricate rhyme structures scattered throughout (On “Everything”: “I got the coldest shoulder in the solar system\\/I know because I drove around this whole existence”). The second verse of “Besos” is a technical marvel, an unconscious performance with tightly-written scheming. Slug does some of his best rapping about race and heritage on “Perfect,” with self-aware bars like “Some say that I pass, none say that I'm passive\\/White trash with a fraction of blackness” and “Irish name, Scandinavian frame\\/I'm a Rubik's cube, I'm the American dream.”Politically-charged and socially conscious records might the next frontier for Atmosphere. In “Seismic Waves,” there’s a great lyric about Trayvon Martin and Ronald Reagan. And Fishing Blues’ saving grace, the only song with any real passion and continuity, is one about police brutality written from the perspective of the officer. In the hands of a less capable thinker and lyricist, this concept would be an epic fumble, but Slug pens an expert indictment of a militarized police force: “It all depends on how you fit into my spectrum\\/From lectures, to handcuffs, to beat downs, to death wish\\/I was told to tell a one-sided story, and that's why I had to eliminate your perspective.” It’s one of the few times you get the sense that he still has reason to rap, and it’s a reminder that Atmosphere can still make great music, when given the proper motivation.\"],[22264,\"“Are these shouts in bravery\\/Or announced recklessness?” So screams Jeremy Stith at the start of “Death Yellows Life and Reason,” a high point of Fury’s debut full-length, Paramount. It’s one of the most powerful and passionate hardcore records of the year so far. Stith is raging, sure, but he’s just as apt to lash inward as outward. Bravery or recklessness? It’s not only a question to ask oneself as the frontman of a hardcore band—it’s a conundrum leveled at the hardcore subculture as a whole. But the beauty of Paramount is that it transcends the scene entirely. It is a devastating work of emotional, even philosophical inquisitiveness that, yes, you can totally punch shit to.Fury hails from California’s Orange County, and there’s weight to that. In the ’80s, youth crew hardcore had a stronghold in the area, thanks to the label Wishingwell and straightedge bands like Unity, Uniform Choice, Insted, and No for an Answer. Fury draw a lot from their geographic forebears: Paramount is built around the youth crew infrastructure of hoarse vocals, chunky riffs, and whiplash breakdowns, with trickles of melody bleeding through. On “Thin Line,” fluid chords flow into palm-muted tension; “In Extremis” slows the aggression to simmer. But as tight, tuneful, dynamic, and immaculately crafted as the music is, it’s Stith’s lyrics that elevate them. “Unworthy sculptors\\/Poor young knives\\/They’ll do what they’re told\\/Lost, unwanting,” goes the opening line of “In Extremis,” meshing cryptic symbolism with the howling, accusatory tone of vintage youth crew—a finger that stabs both ways.Paramount is a proud revival of that Orange County tradition, but oddly enough, the album more closely resembles two legendary East Coast bands from the ’80s: Youth of Today (who released their debut album on Wishingwell) and Bold (who almost released their debut album on Wishingwell). The lunging intro to Paramount’s “Duality of Man” calls to mind Youth of Today’s anthem “Break Down the Walls;” the unrelenting turmoil, pinpoint riffage, and dark undercurrent of Bold’s Speak Out infuses “Damage Is Done.” The youth crew paradox—pissed off and cathartic yet introspective and inspirational—is where Fury’s real reverence comes into play, though. They’re not going through the motions. They’re reimagining one of hardcore’s most vital, specific subgenres as something bigger and more universal, an exploration of what motivates us and holds us back, and what that costs us, as both members of tribes and as individuals. Or in the words of “Duality of Man:” “Lost and aweless\\/I paid to be free\\/Found solace in what’s ahead of me.”As progressive as the album is, “The Feeling” yanks it into another dimension entirely. The four-minute-plus closing track seem to pound along for 10 times that, and it still ends too soon. Churning and metallic—with a dive-bombing dogfight between guitarists Madison Woodward and Alfredo Gutierrez that ventures into early-Fugazi territory—it parallels the turn toward longer compositions, broader influences, and more intricate dynamics that hardcore took in the late ’80s, just before post-hardcore came into its own. The song simply seethes—a nest of exposed nerves clenched in check and spit out through some savage force of will. As always, though, Stith is on a quest. In a voice as big as oblivion, he ponders how open-heartedness can coexist with the pain it inevitably brings.Ultimately, it’s not the pain that wins. On the caustically euphoric “The Fury”— which might as well be the band’s theme—Stith urges, “Take the fury\\/Turn it into something positive,” chewing each syllable like it’s made of glass. He isn’t just tapping into the rich legacy of youth crew optimism, from Unity’s “Positive Mental Attitude” to Youth of Today’s “Positive Outlook;” he and the rest of Fury are walking it like they talk it, plunging headfirst into hardcore’s nihilism and clawing out a raw new hope for the future.\"],[22263,\"In their videos, the Australian duo Hockey Dad are shown skateboarding, skinny dipping, surfing, playing video slot machines, drinking beer, and hanging out at a place called Windang Fast Chicken. A majority of the songs on their full-length debut, Boronia, are about pining for women who are way out of their league. Basically, they are a 2016 version of the Wyld Stallyns, if Bill and Ted had been hypnotized by surf rock instead of metal.The 11 songs on the album bounce with the excitement and innocence of two best friends—singer and guitarist Zach Stephenson and drummer William Fleming—doing what they love best (or at least second-best; they do seem to be pretty good at surfing). Producer Tom Iansek captures Hockey Dad’s energy well, highlighting their electric jangle, occasional rushes of frothy distortion and lots of bubblegum-popping claps. Stephenson doesn’t indulge in much lead guitar playing, and he sings with what Fleming has dubbed a “scrawny grommy voice,”  a rare nasally rasp that puts him in the strange company of Hamilton Leithauser, Bon Scott, Billy Squier, and Joe Elliott from Def Leppard. The album opens with “Can’t Have Them,” which not only sets the nice-guys-finish-last tone that pops up all over Boronia, but also for music that would sound dangerously derivative were it not for Stephenson’s unique voice. “Can’t Have Them” sounds almost like they lifted the backing track from “Not Too Soon” by Throwing Muses and slapped different vocals on top of it, a la “Ça plane pour moi”\\/“Jet Boy, Jet Girl.”  Elsewhere there are moments indebted to the Strokes, Surfer Blood, and Wavves.As for the stories of unrequited love that populate Boronia; they get old quickly. Sample lyrics include, “As I slowly lose my cool, Laura treats me like a fool, I can’t help it, she’s too perfect” in “Laura;” “I see her in my dreams, but I don’t think she sees me” in “Raygun;” and the whole of “I Need a Woman,” the chorus of which is “Don’t make me cry, I need a woman in my life.” Come on, guys: You play in a band! Cheer up! These lyrics threaten to drag the rest of the album down if you listen too closely, but Stephenson’s vocal melodies are buoyant enough to keep it all afloat if you’re playing this in the background. Lyrically, the best moment on the album comes close to the end, when Stephenson puts his romantic pursuits on hold, and indulges in a full-on bromantic ballad. “Two Forever” is a heartfelt message that prioritizes the duo’s friendship over all the women of Boronia. “I don’t need love, don’t need no woman, don’t need that shit, ‘cause I got you, man,” he sings. Sure, it doesn’t read well, but it’s sweet and sincere, and it’s the type of mission statement that if true, could hold this band together as they get better. Hopefully, they will continue to be excellent to each other. \"],[22265,\"You could occupy a whole afternoon arguing about whether the Netflix series “Stranger Things” marks the jump-the-shark moment for the ’80s fetishization that’s been building for the past half-decade, or whether it represents the trend’s creative peak. Does the show cleverly re-invent the ’80s film touchstones that directors Matt and Ross Duffer wear on their sleeve? Or is their riffing on Steven Spielberg, Stephen King, George Lucas, and John Carpenter just artistic cannibalism? Is it time to adjust the tracking-control in our minds and stop looking at the world through VCR-tinted glasses? Surprisingly, these question are pretty much moot when it comes to the first installment of the “Stranger Things” soundtrack. (The forthcoming Volume Two contains entirely different material and more or less accompanies a different set of episodes.) Much to their credit, composers Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein opted for a far less overt nostalgia than the Duffers. This is all the more surprising—not to mention admirable—when you consider that in Dixon and Stein’s main gig as members of the Austin-based experimental synth quartet S U R V I V E, they’re not necessarily shy about their taste for referencing ’80s keyboard sounds, even if they do so with good taste. If S U R V I V E don't quite blur the distinction between the cheese and the cream of that decade, it doesn’t so much matter. By and large, audiences no longer seek to distinguish between, say, the Beverly Hills Cop theme “Axel F” and Duran Duran bassist John Taylor’s serpentine fretwork. Under the heat lamp of kitschy nostalgia, what once sounded artificially sweetened or even objectionable has acquired a hazy glow we regard with fondness. But for the first 10 of Volume One’s thirty-plus tracks, you might get the impression that Dixon and Stein were aiming for the vibe of minimal early-’90s ambient techno instead. Even when they construct a keyboard riff ringing enough to serve as a top-line chorus hook (“Kids”), they still don’t oversaturate the music with retro tones. Whatever you think of how Dixon and Stein’s scoring cues succeed within the framework of the show, the pair deserves credit for its efforts to avoid being intrusive. There are moments when S U R V I V E nods to John Carpenter’s scores, but the duo don’t make the same move here: The first 10 tracks don’t remotely suggest the suspense, horror, supernatural thrills, or even the basic human drama that the show’s storyline aims for. With a plot that involves a search for a missing child, another child who possesses telekinetic abilities, an ancient, monstrous being called a demogorgon, etc, “Stranger Things” hardly lacks for elements one would expect composers would drool at the chance to sink their teeth into.  Taken as a suite of music on its own merits, Volume One flows rather seamlessly—no small achievement. The canvas they paint on is remarkably spare and restrained: At any given point, it feels as if there are only a handful of sounds in the stereo field, and what at first comes off as a limited range slowly reveals itself as the opposite. It takes a while to notice because the first third of the album streams by with the unhurried gentleness of a tiny brook; it’s no insult whatsoever to say that this section of the music, with its pillowy synth pads, is perfectly suited for a scenic drive or even a rainy-day meditation on the porch. Volume One even borders on New Age at times, which initially leaves you scratching your head as to how Dixon, Stein, and the Duffers envisioned that this music would complement and support its target material. But then Volume One takes a dramatic and agile heel turn. The first minute and a half of the album's 11th track, “The Upside Down,” begins with much of the same unthreatening serenity that precedes it, as a feathery keyboard glimmers like rays of sunlight beaming down through the treetops. You almost expect Enya to appear (again, no insult) until the composers hit a 30-second stretch where, using little more than a handful of keyboard swells, they very gently begin to suggest a shift toward a darker mood. When the piece hits the two-minute mark, listeners find themselves plunged into a nightmare before they’ve even had time to blink. Dixon and Stein pull off the change with uncanny grace. Perhaps the most deft and unsettling touch is their use of synths to mimic a vaguely inhuman howling. At its best, horror cinema taps into humankind’s primal terror and reminds us that, at the end of the day, we are still at the mercy of predatory forces that we don’t fully understand. Dixon and Stein’s arrangement on “The Upside Down” hits the bullseye on that sensation, and the fact that they wait so patiently to spring this shift on the audience shows that they put a great deal of thought into their decisions. Down the homestretch, Dixon and Stein allow themselves to indulge the shades of melodrama that listeners will immediately recognize as typical of TV music. Understandably, several of their choices in this section recall the music from the “X-Files,” but at this point, they have have earned the right to ham it up a bit. Aesthetics aside, “Stranger Things” also reminds us of the pros and cons of modern television. Audiences get to enjoy more daring work in long-form format that the traditional network structure just couldn't allow for. On the other hand, we can never be sure these days whether a series is going to make it to another season. As it stands now, it’s up in the air whether “Stranger Things” will be back for a season two. But with not one but two scores to show for their involvement, Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein have at least proven themselves to the world, whatever happens to their vehicle next. \"],[22261,\"Kool A.D. has been on a tear lately, even by his own prolific standards. Official marks his sixth release this year; he’s been keeping a pace of a mixtape a month all summer. He continues to steer towards Lil B comparisons (July’s Zig Zag Zig is 100 tracks long and features a “BASED FREESKRYLE”) and he remains similarly willing to put his experiments and process on display. However, unlike Lil B, who—“California Boy” notwithstanding—tends to stay in his lane stylistically, Kool A.D. continues to roam the sonic map. Recent releases have ranged from focused rap mixtapes that recall his work in Das Racist (Gods of Tomorrow) to entire albums of self-sabotagingly spaced-out bedroom pop (Kool A.D. is Dead). With Official, Kool A.D. has now turned his focus to that other looming influence in the Bay: hyphy.Official is a collaboration of sorts between Kool A.D. and Trackademicks, a Bay Area producer and rapper known for his work with Mistah F.A.B. and an unofficial remix of E-40’s crossover hit “Tell Me When to Go.” Here, Trackademicks provides seven songs’ worth of textbook hyphy beats: heavy thuds of bass, ’90s synth presets, and plenty of 808 claps. In keeping with this sound, Kool A.D. slips, chameleon-like, into a hyphy persona. While he’s dabbled in the hyphy sound plenty of times before, particularly on his “bus route” trilogy of tapes (“California Music Channel” on 2012’s 51 was produced by and featured a verse from Trackademicks), Official represents a sustained and far deeper engagement with the subgenre. Here, Kool A.D. fully embodies the native sounds of his terroir, gliding over these tracks with a smooth E-40-esque flow. Even his use of regional slang and delivery of ad-libs (either whispered or half-sung in a higher register) is on the nose throughout the course of Official.Unlike his previous work, Kool’s focus here is on staying in character, a task that he seems to delight in. In place of the usual interplay between stoned clowning and profundity we get lines about partying, money, women, and stunting regarding his access to all of the above. Take the chorus of the trunk-rattling “Rollin’ Thru the Town:” “We be rollin’ through the town\\/Blowin’ hella clouds\\/Woofers hella loud\\/With the windows rolled down like\\/Ay, ay, ay, ay\\/Ay, ay, ay, ay.” “This Mane” feels a little closer to Kool’s wheelhouse, with the rapper repeating the phrase, “Y’all ‘aint even fucking with this, mane” until it becomes a sort of hater-baiting mantra. “Clapper” is the closest we get to any internal conflict, with Kool slipping into his usual flow during the first verse, though he's back to full hyphy mode in time for the chorus (“This a clapper mane, bruh, this a heater\\/Slap it in the old school, slap it in the beater”).This is pretty low-stakes stuff, but it makes for a fun, breezy listen, especially compared to Kool A.D.’s longer, more freewheeling releases, which can feel impenetrable to all but diehard fans. That said, unlike most of those projects, there aren’t any quotables or moments of clarity to be found here, just seven tracks of lighthearted character-study. Kool A.D. has typically repurposed and flipped other rappers’ lines as well as his own and Official feels like a radical extension of that impulse, an album-length exercise in mimicry. Then again, hyphy’s loose energy has always served a primary influence for Kool and Official can be just as easily read as a love letter to the sounds of his hometown. Official probably won’t soundtrack an east Oakland sideshow any time soon, though were it to pop up at one, it wouldn’t raise many eyebrows.\"],[22234,\"London-based producer Lexxi’s “Red Eyez” served as the closer on Elysia Crampton’s excellent July release Demon City. Crisp and determined, the track did the tough work of providing resolution to Crampton’s thematically and sonically sprawling album, setting the listener in a dark-but-hopeful present. A version of “Red Eyez” reappears on Lexxi’s debut EP 5STARBOI—this time, weighted down by the introduction of blown-out bass—linking the two projects; Crampton herself tweeted that Demon City “is really just an advertisement for Lexxi’s 5TARBO1 EP, a poem and captivating accomplishment in its own right.” The succinctness of “Red Eyez” carries throughout the five tracks that comprise 5STARBOI. Where their collaborations on Demon City embraced collage, Lexxi’s solo material is notably direct. “Pared-down” might be an overstatement, as his compositions are still generously adorned, hissing and crackling at the seams, but if Demon City stretched to encompass both past and future, 5TARBOI takes place in a single wide-eyed moment. The EP opens with an anarchic deluge of synth noise, which swiftly gives way to the sort of icy, winding phrase Lexxi is particularly skilled at making. His melodies, which are generally quite simple and will reiterate for the length of a track, bring to mind a less-elastic Arca. Bookended by squalls of texture and undergirded by stuttering grime-inflected beats, this music is certainly aggressive (angry, even) but by no means relentless. On “$ever0” (whose title references severo, a style pioneered by Lexxi, Crampton, and their friends: “an accumulation or accretion, an ongoing process of becoming-with,” as Crampton recently described it to Resident Advisor), a creeping rhythm is met with ambient tones and metallic echoes—pacing that’s far from the club. It brings to mind a somewhat-more-contemporary version of the sort of affected London sound in Zomby and Burial’s saddest tracks; similarly, this is music that is very much marked by urban space. What differentiates this set of tracks from such UK forebears, and draws it even closer to associates like Chino Amobi, Lotic, and Crampton, is its nuanced emotional tenor. 5TARBOI feels balefully of-the-moment, acutely aware of its surroundings. At its heart, it’s a statement of youth, a coming-of-age record, even. And, tinged with sadness, this coming-of-age can be as much a mourning as it is a celebration. Any moody restraint sustained elsewhere on the release is cast aside on closer “Up Top,” an anthem with both crushing and delicate elements. Its melancholic climax winds across octaves, while an errant synth screeches uncomfortably close to atonal territory; the track finishes on an unresolved note. Lexxi captures a feeling of cathartic dissolution, a moment when coming into being means coming undone. \"],[22226,\"Upon leaving electronic outfit Seekae to embark on a solo career, Australian musician Alex Cameron started committing to his stage character by applying latex wrinkles, scars, and pockmarks to his face before each public performance or appearance. These can be seen pretty clearly on the album cover of his debut solo album Jumping the Shark. Though the record is seeing official release this month, the photo was taken back in 2014, when the album was originally given away for free on Cameron’s charming “Remember Geocities, guys ;-))) ???” website. Cameron’s goal was to look the part of the sketchy, down-and-out lounge singer he played in his songs.However, now that Cameron is on the road, he’s announced that he’s no longer wearing the wrinkles. The decision is a good one: By removing the mask, he renders the character of Alex Cameron even stranger, as there’s now one less layer between the audience and the man giving ridiculous interviews like this, making it feel less of an act and more of an open question: Is this who this guy really is? Wrinkles or not, what might actually make people care about Alex Cameron is the fact that he’s a great storyteller, one who uses simple song forms to couch vivid messages. Seven of Jumping the Shark’s brief eight tracks are in the first person, and each one depicts a cast of losers and creeps whose unifying thread is “the sort of desperate nature of trying to avoid failure.” Though his characters are caricatures of the downtrodden—e.g., “the drunkest, ugliest girl at the bar;” broken men who’ve moved back in with their parents—Cameron has crafted these characters so convincingly it’s easy to imagine he’s being honest when he says he drew some from his own life. Cameron’s sketches wouldn’t hit home quite as deeply without his effortless compositions, which perfectly complement his scuzzy, blue-light tales of woe. Driven by elementary synth programming and Cameron’s confident, warm baritone, the music suggests a Nick Cave-meets-second-album-Suicide aesthetic. But unlike Alan Vega’s airy, effect-masked vocals, which included a lot of reverb, gasps and yawps—making them frequently more atmospheric than not—Cameron places his voice audibly front and center, emphasizing his narrative gift. Both “Happy Ending” and recent single “The Comeback” follow this template to great effect, sharing the miseries of freshly jobless men trying to convince themselves that they know how to move on. The latter in particular, with its sunny melody underneath a story of TV host who won’t let go of the past, feels especially devastating—the juxtaposition of warm sounds and bleak words creates a bizarre sense of false comfort that channels the denial of the narrator perfectly.A few tracks vary this formula to even greater success. On “Real Bad Lookin’,” Cameron provides a circus-carousel oom-pah accompaniment but breaks the song open with a heavily-treated guitar solo in the mold of Robert Fripp. “Mongrel” the only song without first-person narration, conjures the playfulness of White Williams, embracing the poetic freedom that comes from abandoning the perspective of a sad cretin; the poetic closing line “Death is the pulse in your eye on your very last breath” registers as perhaps the most remarkable lyric on the record.As could be expected for a Vegas-style showman, Cameron saves an elegiac note for last, wrapping up the record with the austere “Take Care of Business,” which meditates slowly for the song’s first few minutes on a simple repeated keyboard and drum program before an organ synth bursts in with climax as Cameron’s reverb-heavy vocals begin chanting the chorus: “I ain’t half the man I wanted to be\\/You gotta take care of business.” The accompanying video for this single depicts the still-wrinkled Cameron contorted on stage under a harsh blue light (an idea repeated again on the video for “The Comeback”)—making overt the subconscious David Lynch connection.At only eight songs and thirty-two minutes, Jumping the Shark makes the most of its quick run time to sell you on the idea that Cameron’s “I’ve been cut so I know how to bleed” tales carry the charm and gravitas of authenticity; the fact that he is making it harder to see the difference between himself and his characters only cements this impression. More importantly, the melding of these stories with Cameron’s efficient, minimal compositions create the type of songs that penetrate deeply and linger in your consciousness long after you’ve stopped listening to them. \"],[22262,\"In 1977, New York City was in turmoil: the crime rate was high, morale was low and a serial killer was on the loose. Yet, as the social fabric was disintegrating across the five boroughs, artistic creativity was thriving. Punk rock shows attracted crowds too large for even the scene’s most popular venues, disco music flowed into the mainstream and the nascent hip-hop movement was gaining traction in the South Bronx. This is the setting for The Get Down, the Baz Luhrmann-produced series that was reportedly ten years in the making.The show’s first six episodes premiered on Netflix on August 12 and its soundtrack was delivered on the same day, featuring a mix of disco-era classics and original compositions. These songs are woven through the episodes that retell the adventures of the protagonist (Ezekiel Figuero, played by a watchful Justice Smith) as a teenager in 1977, as narrated by his older self in 1996. Regrettably, despite a roster of all-star musicians, the album falls short as a standalone work and even shorter when considered as the accompaniment to a musical drama.It’s very frustrating when a song has all the elements for success, but you can hear them getting in each other’s way. Twice, on two different songs, Michael Kiwanuka is derailed by verses from an apathetic Nas. The first instance is “Rule The World (I Came From the City),” which starts out as a brooding ballad bookended by Kiwanuka’s dark, bluesy timbre. But the second foul, “Black Man in a White World (Ghetto Gettysburg Address),” is flagrant, because the original version would’ve been a perfect addition to this soundtrack if left untouched. Its lyrics, recounting the malaise of disenfranchised minority citizens, ring as true in 2016 as they would have in 1977.Though it’s tempting to blame the dischord on a somewhat unlikely pairing, this strategy proves quite effective effective elsewhere on the album. The tracklist smartly matches up artists who were born long after disco had died with musicians who lived through and even defined the era. Zayn and Teddy Pendergrass come together on a Grandmaster Flash-helmed rework of “You Can’t Hide From Yourself,” from Pendergrass’ debut album. Zayn commendably pushes his voice to the upper reaches of his range on the first half, but then steps aside to let Teddy P bring it home. “Telepathy,” a simple love song made grander through an arrangement of horns and strings, is one of Christina Aguilera’s best performances in recent years. The vocal is restrained by her standards, but it still comes through strong and measured—guided by the incomparable Nile Rodgers. Leon Bridges offers an amped-up tribute to “Ball of Confusion,” and he succeeds by respecting the Temptations’ 1970 hit single while somehow emulating their energy in a solo performance.Some more relief comes around the soundtrack’s midsection, in the form of five unedited grooves. Among them, Lyn Collins’ funk classic “Think (About It)” and Donna Summer’s “Bad Girls,” which you either recognize because of her long-lasting influence as the Queen of Disco or from a manic Girl Talk album. While these tracks haven’t lost any of their floor-filling lustre through the years, they are almost outdone by two original compositions from Miguel and Janelle Monáe. Miguel flips a disco beat into something much trippier on “Cadillac,” which shares a name with the sinister coked-out club owner played by relative newcomer Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. The song comes complete with an esoteric bridge (“That unicorn, that lush\\/That savage baby, that rush”) and a dreamlike outro that lasts for over a minute. But Monáe’s “Hum Along & Dance (Gotta Get Down)” is the showstopper, built from uplifting brass, a dirty bassline and a chorus that name checks the series title. If the show were to have an official theme song this should be it, rather than Jaden Smith’s middling “Welcome to the Get Down.”Monáe’s song is wedged between “Bad Girls” and CJ & Co.’s “Devil’s Gun” on a five-song throwback stretch that ends with Hector Lavoe’s “Que Lio,” but everything that follows feels like filler. The soundtrack is on sale as a deluxe version, a term that often foretells a sequence of unrelated bonus tracks tacked on to the end. Starting with “Just You, Not Now (Love Theme)” by Australian singer Grace, we shift away abruptly from the overarching disco theme and wade through a cluster of songs that are tough to appreciate when divorced from their context (although three of them showcase newcomer Herizen Guardiola who is definitely one to watch.) The entire thing clocks in at roughly an hour and a half—the average length of a feature film that would need to tell a much more cohesive and complete story to keep an audience engaged.It’s rare for a soundtrack to exceed the performance of the work that it’s meant to complement. Superfly and Shaft are two notable exceptions from the same decade depicted in The Get Down—Pharrell’s “Happy” is a more modern example. The show will go down in history for many reasons, unfortunately it doesn’t seem like this album will be one of them.\"],[22193,\"As an aspiring songwriter, Jahron Brathwaite signed a publishing deal with Warner\\/Chappell at 18. The songs the Mississauga-born artist wrote for other artists before assuming the moniker PARTYNEXTDOOR never found much traction, but after darkening his sound Brathwaite caught the ear of OVO co-founder Oliver El-Khatib in early 2013. Fast-forward a few months and his vocals were floating in the background on Drake’s Nothing Was the Same. Since then, Brathwaite has become one of Drake’s closest collaborators, with writing credits and\\/or appearances on each of his last three solo releases. Earlier this year, Brathwaite scored his first Billboard No. 1, penning Rihanna’s humid Drake-featuring summer jam “Work,” which spent nine consecutive weeks at the top of the charts.The island vibes of “Work” soak Brathwaite’s third studio album, PARTYNEXTDOOR 3. The album helps prove he’s a lot more than just Drake’s patois advisor. Clothes that don’t quite fit his boss feel effortlessly tailored to Brathwaite: “You heard a lot about Jamaicans, and you wanna know what it’d be like,” he sings with an infectious assuredness on “Don’t Know How;” “Only U” is three minutes of sweat and anticipation erected on top of a skeletal swing; on the cavernous “Not Nice,” he expresses his need to “hold the corner and then slow whine it.” The way physical pleasures intertwine with emotional turmoil encompasses most of Brathwaite’s focus on the album—in Brathwaite’s world, sex is not as a shortcut to intimacy but a reflection of it, even if he has a tendency to latch onto carnality in the absence of intimacy.Given the time PARYNEXTDOOR 3 dedicates to the aftermath of infidelity, that’s pretty often. “Come and See Me” is tuned to more a nuanced frequency, disguising a lament about uneven give-and-take in a relationship in the clothes of an “R U up?” booty-call anthem. Unfortunately, he’s not always as tuned to his partners. “Why do you act like I’m sexist or something, just for calling you sexy?” Brathwaite asks with genuine confusion on “Nothing Easy to Please,” a line suggesting some of his relationship woes might stem from not understanding women quite as well as he thinks. When he claims that “she knows what I have to calm her down” on “Don’t Run,” it’s both a reference to his sexual prowess and the mindful attention of a supportive partner.Once again, helping elevate Brathwaite’s lust is his production. He tucks unexpected elements in spots they may go unnoticed at first—you might not catch the whistling littered throughout “You’ve Been Missed” until the fifth listen, but once registered, it’s just another memorable hook amongst a litany of others. These are the rewards of a studio rat given free reign, where awe is found in the novel arrangement of sounds in space.PARTYNEXTDOOR 3 is stuffed with such moments: the random drops of water punctuating “High Hopes;” the rusted pipes that act as percussion on “Nobody;” the Carlos Santana-esque guitars that weave in and out of “Spiteful. ”And then there’s “Brown Skin,” which could go toe to toe with anything from Fade to Mind’s catalog, and Brathwaite never once sounds unsure of his footing on the track’s ever-shifting surface.The downside: left unchecked, this freedom can devolve into self-indulgence. There’s absolutely no need for opener “High Hopes” to be over seven minutes long, and on “Problems & Selfless” the atmosphere crosses the line that separates intoxicating from suffocating. When Brathwaite decides to let a song breathe, though, it usually works to his advantage, giving something that clicks room to simmer a bit longer without overstaying its welcome.  On P3, he has earned the right to stretch the edges of a sound that now feels uniquely his. \"],[22244,\"At the core of Pill’s debut full-length, Convenience, is a statement in the form of a question: “Is this situation based on power?” The query is rhetorical—of course it is—and singer\\/bassist Veronica Torres has her follow-up locked and loaded, a revolver pointed at the head of the patriarchy. “My body, my queerness, my decision to bring life,” she sings on “My Rights.” “My body my fight, congressman wants to steal all of my rights.”Already fixtures in the Brooklyn DIY scene, Pill  introduced themselves last year with a self-titled EP that dropped via Andrew Savage’s Dull Tools label. (The band has since signed to Mexican Summer.) As with Savage’s band, the post-punk quartet Parquet Courts, Pill are careful students of rock history, but difficult to pigeonhole. Often, Pill is described as a no wave act, a genre that was defined above all by its refusal to be categorized. “I can’t stand it when you hear a band and you know exactly what’s in their record collection,” Teenage Jesus and the Jerks’ Lydia Lunch once said. While one might guess at the bands that have inspired Pill (Neu!, ESG, Sonic Youth, Sleater-Kinney), the four-piece is more than an assortment of influences. Convenience, takes the themes of their EP and expands on them, tightening their hooks in some places, letting looser arrangements unfurl in others. Torres tends towards a speak-sneer that sometimes verges on spoken word. Her lyrics, steeped in feminism, are immediate and cutting. “Convenience is more modern-day folk or protest music for the conflicted confines that New York City has become,” reads Pill’s Bandcamp description. Anger is vented, lust explored and questions asked, but no panacea offered. On “Fetish Queen,” Torres presents herself as both a sex object and romantic adversary. “Picture me in your favorite tee,” she sings, indulging High Fidelity rock dude fantasies, before flipping the script: “Love serenade in a hand grenade\\/Love serenade in a bondage game.” Though Torres’ lyrics are confrontational and sardonic, they’re also clever, sometimes darkly funny. “Body con, body conscious, body consent, body control,” she sings on “Love & Other Liquids,” mixing images of Herve Leger clubwear with a pro-choice call to arms. On “Speaking Up,” a song about a workplace sexual advance, the liner notes include a sad face emoji. “No I won’t get you a coffee :-( I’m your superior!,” they read, placing the exchange firmly, and realistically, in the realm of an office Slack chat. Set to clean guitar and warbling sax, plays like the negative of a Violent Femmes song, with Pill calling out creepiness for what it is. But Pill is more than a mouthpiece for Torres and, more often than not, she’s locked right in with the other three players. Convenience ranges from post-punk to surf-rock to free-jazz, but no matter the sound, the songs seem rooted in communal improvisation. Benjamin Jaffe, the band’s saxophonist, creates ribbons of noise that oscillate between artful squawks, painterly washes of sound, and technical, free-associative runs. The sax establishes a constant push and pull with Torres, and the lyrics about power dynamics are mirrored in the back-and-forth of the song structures, with Jaffe serving as a de-facto second vocalist. Using Andrew Spaulding and Torres’ tight rhythm section as anchor, Jaffe just as easily becomes a lounge act riding a motorik beat (“Love & Other Liquids”) or a psychedelic punk, whose dissonant wails melt into the chug of Jonathan Campolo’s guitars (“Medicine”). Campolo and Spaulding, it should be said, do triple duty or more—each playing a variety of instruments including a custom-made noise rig.Because Convenience covers so much distance, and does so with such a free-associative spirit, everything doesn’t always hang together; it wouldn’t be as interesting if it did. Unexpected digressions lead to minutes of far-out jamming that derail the album’s momentum (see: “Sex With Santa”). The band is more effective when riding a groove (“Vagabond”) rather than going for broke in psychedelic-freakout mode (“100% Cute”). More often than not, though, Pill’s four members create controlled chaos that combines musical chops rarely seen in punk with incisive social commentary. Other bands have one without the other, but Pill know words are only as powerful as the music behind them.   \"],[22217,\"Deja Carr’s voice is a force of gravity, an instrument of rare range and seemingly limitless capacity for empathy. When she howls, her vocals clip into the red, and her rapping jolts you straight awake. On Kiid, her first full LP, her voice is raw, collected, and honest, scaling heights that you may have forgotten were there. Mal Devisa is Carr’s solo moniker. She grew up in the Bronx and, at five, moved to the college town of Amherst, Mass. Carr seems to have absorbed the intellectual rigor that is the oxygen of such a place—the societal critique in her songs and interviews is razor sharp—as well as its heart. (“I’m definitely a small town person,” Carr once said. “When I go to the city I’m like, ‘Why is no one returning my smile?’ It’s kind of sad.”) At 12, Carr attended a Girls Rock Camp lead by a former member of the ’70s outfit Fanny and started a funk band called Who’da Funk It; the group lasted until Carr was 17, and a year later, in 2014, she released her first music as Mal Devisa. Her debut EP included a cover of Feist’s “Honey Honey” as well as a remarkably classic-sounding blues ballad called “Daisy,” which appears here.Kiid pairs that enormous, smoldering voice with spare instrumentation—Carr is mostly accompanied by her rumbling bass, with occasional piano, drums, and beats. The minimalism of the music is a foil, highlighting how thundering Carr’s alto can be. Rhythm is her primary instrument, and it follows that her grandfather was the New York City-bred jazz drummer Bruno Carr, who recorded with Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles. Warmed with tape hiss, Kiid was released with no label after a successful Kickstarter campaign, and it accordingly ascribes to its own genre-skewing logic. Brilliantly sequenced, it contains two sets of five mostly acoustic tracks, capped by a booming rap song at the end of each side—declarations of unwavering autonomy, bars that leave foes present and historical in the dust. Carr’s commanding songs have the wide-open, recursive feeling of jazz and blues. The bass guitar, plucked and strummed, makes Kiid feel tactile and alive.No matter the style, the spirits of Nina Simone and Billie Holiday lurk in all of these songs. Carr’s borderless voice has a similar way of luxuriating in every note. You would not be mistaken for hearing shades of Merrill Garbus, too. (Carr has a tUnE-yArDs tattoo.) The mesmerizing “Sea of Limbs” is performed so starkly that you can feel the dimensions of the room it was recorded in—the darkness and the tables and chairs and caverns of space. “If you swim in a sea of limbs\\/Don’t be surprised when someone tries to grab you,” Carr sings, wringing the stoic resolve out of such images as “Poseidon and his golden rage” and “skin like a tidal wave.” On the tender “Everybody Knows,” Carr’s melismatic singing twists syllables into sublime shapes. “Everybody knows that my heart grows deeper than the water,” she sings. “I will make a road map out of my heart.”There are more aggressive moments on Kiid, too. The clattering, densely layered “In My Neighborhood” is grounded by sinister industrial electronics. It sounds like an anti-gentrification anthem: “Girl don’t shut your eye\\/This is called the world,” she snarls, “Don’t look hip enough?\\/That’s cause I’m not hip enough\\/In my neighborhood.” Kiid ends with “Dominatrix,” one of the album’s two exhilarating rap songs, erupting all of its frustration into a restless flow. It is a jarring final purge, a menacing wrecking ball of feminist defiance: “I’m a dominatrix when the bass kicks\\/I’m eating up the spirits like the shackles on the slave ships,” she raps. “I’m better off being a queen in size 16 jeans… or the only black woman slaying science on TV.” These moments, and particularly the boiling-point of “Dominatrix,” underscore the more quiet rage that is simmering all along.The starry penultimate track “Forget that I.” is just Carr and piano, as if there is a sole light beaming down on her: “I am more than what you think of me\\/I fight fires in the dark\\/In the beauty of it all\\/I forget that I have lied\\/I am holding onto my own life.” Songs so precisely about survival are rarely so full of grace. In interviews, Carr has expressed the inspiration she’s drawn from the Black Lives Matter movement; she once evoked the lyrics to “Forget that I.” when discussing the colorblindness that permeates America, the forces that make it easier to “reject people that don't look like us.” “I know for a fact that everyone is more than what I see when I look at them,” Carr said, “and maybe more than what they see when they look at themselves.” These realities naturally charge all of Kiid. Even its abstract lyrics feel politicized: On “Live Again,” when Carr repeats its titular refrain—“Why do we live again?”—the answer seems to ring out in the song's echoes.Kiid’s opener “Fire” distills her power into its most heartbreakingly simple expression. She sings of “fire in the brains” of all those trying to make sense of our painfully nonsensical world. “Does it kill you to know that we’re all dying?” Carr sings. “It kills me to know.” Musically, it sounds classic—wise, like an old soul—and yet “Fire” is the sound of this very moment. Her lyrics ponder grave injustices, process immense breaches, and yet they are searingly lucid. Perhaps this is what makes Mal Devisa so profound: For 30 minutes, there is nothing between you and her voice.\"],[22232,\"Lance Washington was four years old when a heart attack killed his father. Raised in Chicago, Washington moved to Arizona for college, where he planned to study film. He developed a dependency on Adderall and dealt with depression during his freshman year, something he helped counter by writing poetry. Poetry became songwriting, and Washington started making music under the name Lando Chillrissian, which he soon shortened to Lando Chill. Late in 2014, Washington began to write the songs that would become the basis for his debut album on Mello Music Group, For Mark, Your Son. He’s referred to the album as “self-medication,” a means of treating a loss that he had yet to come to terms with. But if the record represents a document of extended grieving for a father barely known, it’s just as much an introduction to a young artist who, after writing songs partly for his own personal betterment, abruptly finds himself in front of an audience. Piano-based boom-bap and chipmunk soul beats are sprinkled throughout the record, (courtesy of Duncan “D-Funk” Odea and David “Jetlag” Manin, two Arizona producers), and Washington raps more than he does anything else. But For Mark is not a traditional rap record; Washington was a fan of folk music in college, and his songs are rough-hewn and acoustic-sounding. Several of them feature his unaffected singing and though his voice is vaguely reminiscent of Kid Cudi’s, frequent comparisons between the two artists speak to their shared interested in a variety of genres (and the fact that Washington has mentioned him as an influence) more than anything else. They’re not all that much alike. Lando Chill is a competent rapper, and a competent song-maker, but the concept of For Mark, Your Son is more promising than its execution. It’s difficult to learn much about Washington on scattered songs like “Early in the Morning,” a pleasant little ode to the pleasures of morning weed and morning sex without a single memorable line. And for the most part, we don’t get a good sense of how his grief has affected him, even on songs like “Proud,” which explicitly reference his father. That’s not to say there aren’t interesting things going on here. They’re simply underdeveloped. In the two-minute song “Save Me,” Washington wrestles with bitterness and doubt, asking “Who’s gonna save me when this God ain’t enough?” In the next line, he blames the same God for taking his father. It’s the rawest and most moving moment on the album, and it hints at why Washington may not be particularly well-suited to rap. Most rappers thrive on verbosity, or at least the raw ability to do interesting things with language. But Washington’s music is strongest when his lyrics are most concise. Washington is nothing if not ambitious. He is already eagerly discussing his next record, another concept album, this one based on Paulo Coelho’s novel The Alchemist. It may be that writing about a less closely held topic will allow him the room to open up, and to experiment with a style that fits him better than much of the music on For Mark. In an interview with Respect Magazine, he declared that he didn’t have a definitive sound, saying that instead he had “a voice, a message.” But while there’s no reason why an artist should be wedded to any particular genre, for a largely unknown musician like Lando Chill, developing a comfortable musical approach might accentuate that message, and allow it to resonate.\"],[22020,\"In 2014, Mississippi rap duo Rae Sremmurd became hugely popular off the strength of oddball party anthems like “No Flex Zone” and “No Type.” The following year’s full-length SremmLife made good on those joyous pop-rap instincts; carried by the outlandish, even cartoonish voices of of brothers Swae Lee and Slim Jxmmi, they made joyous inclusive rap that produced enough energy to power a city block. Their music was fun, infectious, whimsical, and a potent (if momentary) remedy for agoraphobia. And yet some rap fans cried “foul,” dismissed them as empty-calories frat-rap, a mix of LMFAO’s party rock cut with Ying Yang Twins crunk and packaged in the youthful exuberance of Kris Kross. When Complex named SremmLife its third-best album of 2015, former Hot 97 program director and current Beats 1 DJ Ebro Darden launched an all-out assault on the duo, saying that the selection couldn’t be valid. He accused the brothers of not writing their own raps and capped his comments with another diminishing jab: “It was a fabricated thing we all liked.” Two of the most electric new voices in rap were suddenly being reduced to the rap equivalent of Milli Vanilli. Mike WiLL Made-It, the super producer who helped mastermind the duo’s success (and the alleged ghostwriter), addressed the allegations on Twitter as only he can: “See the Problem is niggas be stuck in these old ass boxes they scared to jump out of…” Jumping out of the box is exactly what SremmLife 2 does. Whether by design, by accident, or simply out of necessity, SremmLife 2 deconstructs the party-rap formula the duo perfected on their debut, zigging and zagging from Drake-esque rap-sung half-ballads (“Now That I Know”) to Mustard’s “ratchet music” (“Set the Roof,” with a Lil Jon-feature nod to crunk) to sugary bubblegum rap (“Just Like Us”), all while maintaining the  spirit at the core of SremmLife. The album’s default setting is synthpop, retrofitted with Mike WiLL’s disorienting array of bells, whistles, tones, and clattering drum kits. Its most ambitious outings, like the back-to-back combo of metallic stargazers “Look Alive” and “Black Beatles,” push their talents to new heights by redefining what the duo can and will do. The songs hook into each other at the ends, creating seamless album-friendly transitions. The weirdest and wildest moments on SremmLife 2 are its lifeblood. The album is stranger, artsier, and flat-out ballsier than its predecessor, especially considering the stakes (SremmLife produced five platinum singles; this is a follow-up that doesn’t seem to care much about that.) It’s a less dance-friendly alternative driven by the yelps and whines of its two stars. Slim Jxmmi tears through the hook and verse on “Start a Party” like a man possessed, moving at a ferocious pace that makes his voice crack. On “Swang,” which strobes in a fluorescent neon glow, Swae Lee floats in and out of a wispy falsetto. The most challenging song is “Take It or Leave It,” with Swae Lee going full crooner, belting out a pitchy-but-charming melody. When Swae jumps too far out of pocket, Jxmmi is there with the answer, settling things with even-keeled verses. Swae Lee, in particular, is venturing into Young Thug territory: His arsenal of yips, squeals, and whistling falsettos has grown exponentially, and he’s willing to try just about anything now, which results in some strangely liberating artistic choices. But it’s Slim Jxmmi who really grows here. Many past Rae Sremmurd songs were exhibitions for Swae’s vocal acrobatics (“No Type,” in particular), with Jxmmi playing springboard, but Jxmmi is showing greater range and rapping with much more force. He even puts together some of the most quotable bars: “A young nigga so superb\\/I’m Kool Herc on the herb” on “Real Chill;” on “Over Here,” “Charlie Sheen is my clone\\/Can they fuck with us? No\\/Red carpets my home\\/VIP my throne.” Together they’ve become one of rap’s most exciting tag-teams, and it appears that the brothers are getting the last laugh on those ghostwriting allegations.Rae Sremmurd were born of the “Crank Dat” and “ringtone rap” eras, where hooks and dances powered entire careers. That era of rap was often considered disposable, too. (Nas made a whole album about it.) But acts like Soulja Boy and Travis Porter have proven durable, and they’ve had a discernable influence on the Brown brothers, not just in their sound but their swagger: the sense of being unbothered, unburdened, and invincible that comes with being super-young, rich, and black. It’s that same sense of liberation that fuels the boldest decisions on this album. SremmLife 2 collects all of the quirks in the margins of its predecessor and develops them; more than anything else, SremmLife 2 is the ultimate middle finger to grouches who think this brand of rap can’t be complex.\"],[22215,\"Like Slow Club’s previous albums, One Day All of This Won’t Matter Anymore finds the British duo of Rebecca Taylor and Charles Watson trying on new sounds. This time, they traveled to Spacebomb Studios in Richmond, VA., where producer Matthew E. White enlisted the studio’s house band to provide the template. The core of the Spacebomb house band also helped give Natalie Prass her slow-burning variation on classic soul for her 2015 self-titled debut. But Slow Club have already done soul, with 2014’s Complete Surrender. The sound they ended up capturing here is more akin to soft rock of the ’70s and ’80s. Taylor often channels the likes of Sheena Easton and Linda Ronstadt, while Watson can sound like the singer from America or Walter Egan (the guy who sang “Magnet and Steel”).Slow Club present these songs in easy listening costumes, but below the surface, One Day is seething with disconnect and sorrow. The pair sing in unison less than on any of their previous releases—or at least Taylor’s voice is lower in the mix than usual when she helps augment Watson’s melodies. Though they aren’t singing together as much, it sounds like they might be singing to each other more than ever. Taylor sings lines like “I’m finding it too hard to accept your help” in “Champion;” Watson sings lines like “you’ve got your battles and they rage like an ancient rolling sea” in the lead single, “Ancient Rolling Sea.”Whether or not the latter song is actually about her, Taylor’s lyrics do evoke raging battles. She sings of being awful to lovers in several songs, and of “turning up at parties like a hurricane” on “In Waves,” the album’s second single. The latter track boasts a brilliant video, in which Taylor uses a GoPro head strap mount to capture a dizzying day of her boozing and brooding. The video also includes a shot where Watson is slouched into a seat across from Taylor in a coffee shop, playing up the rigmarole of talking on the phone to the press: “We were kinda aware it’s not like a load of bangers,” he says, “but it’s what we enjoy doing.”While he’s right that there aren’t a load of bangers on here, there are several stellar songs, the best of which showcase the duo’s adaptability, especially in surrendering musical control to the Spacebomb house band. Songs like “Where the Light Gets Lost” and “Give Me Some Peace” reach transcendence in their final minutes, as the full band stretches the tunes into unexpected shapes. “Sweetest Grape on the Vine” effortlessly floats along the “sunny day highway” that Alex Chilton was singing about in Big Star’s “Big Black Car.” “Come on Poet” allows Taylor to belt out hard emotional phrases that seem like necessary exorcisms.The biggest issue with One Day is the sequencing. Two Watson-led songs kick off the album, so it takes about 10 minutes before Taylor steps into the spotlight. This wouldn’t be so jarring if their songwriting styles didn’t seem to be growing apart. Slow Club identified as a Sheffield duo for several years, but now they live in separate cities, he in London and she in Margate, about two hours away. The Spacebomb house band do a decent job of keeping the instrumental shades consistent, but the songs Watson sings often have comparatively lighter stories—given the heaviness of Taylor’s lyrics, it feels odd to postpone her entrance for so long. For example, on “Tattoo,” Watson sings against a breezy disco-lite rhythm of saving up money to get some ink, only for it all to be ruined by scars resulting from a double bypass. Watson’s nonchalant narrative and dark humor are a stark foil to Taylor’s writing, which feels deeply personal; “Tattoo” rather inappropriately precedes a track where Taylor sings, “my hunger, it struck, we succumbed to our fuck.” You might call this uneasy listening.\"],[22225,\"By any reasonable measure, summer 2016 is turning out to be a challenging time for people seeking even a modicum of contentment with the world. From our social media feeds to the 24-hour news cycle, we’re being fed a steady diet of abject misery, and it’s beginning to take its toll on even the most trivial aspects of our culture. Take for example, an annual ritual pop music fans typically heartily anticipate: The Song of the Summer, when one hit single above all others is crowned as the inescapable feel-good chart-topper of the year. For the first time in what seems like decades, the airwaves are barren of such a mood stabilizer, and while the factors contributing towards such an absence may be varied and complex (the continued destabilization of the music industry; streaming media creating a niche listening culture rather than an overarching mainstream; the general sense of apathy gripping the nation), it has left an undeniable void.However, this vacuum may be one reason why Roosevelt’s self-titled debut album feels like a balm from its first track. Roosevelt sounds like an almost scientific approach to a summer dance record; a cocktail of disco, French touch, Ibiza house, yacht rock, and electropop that evokes some crowded Tiki-torch dancefloor lost on the Mediterranean coast. Even the artwork plays the part: Roosevelt (aka Cologne-based producer\\/DJ Marius Lauben) stands awash in purple light, his name displayed in a sharp, 1980s cursive. It looks like something you’d find on a poolside coffee table of a Malibu mansion after a massive rager, slightly stained with suntan lotion and margarita mix.Germany isn’t known for its tropical exports, which is probably why there’s an underlying moodiness threaded throughout Roosevelt, a sense that the album’s sunny disposition may be as fleeting as summer itself. The lead single “Colours” begins with buoyant bongos and a dry, upbeat piano melody, before Roosevelt’s slightly wispy voice floats into the mix. “When you left\\/You took your colors with you,” he sings over a building disco beat, a wisp of melancholy drifting through an unbridled party. It’s a trick Roosevelt uses often on the album, tempering a rush of adrenaline with a dose of Teutonic sobriety.The fact that Roosevelt is being released on Joe Goddard’s Greco-Roman label is no surprise, as it shares a sort of spiritual kinship with some of Hot Chip’s more bombastic moments, while mimicking some of their nerdy charm. Every song on the record contributes to this air of reverie, a testament to Roosevelt’s strength as a producer, as one track languidly slips into the next. If anything, it can get a little too laid back—it’s the kind of record that's so uniform it ends before you realize it.That being said, tracks like “Fever” do an impressive job of highlighting what is probably Roosevelt’s most impressive talent: finding subtle ways to reinvigorate some of dance music’s most widely-abused tropes. Nothing has been more overused in the past five years than four-to-the-flour, punchy keyboard stabs (think every single Calvin Harris song since 2009), but when “Fever” opens with them, it feels fresh, not like a quick production trick that's been used thousands of times. It’s not a stroke of genius, but it’s cleverly deployed, and touches like this elevate the album and give it a slightly tongue-in-cheek edge.The album ends with “Close,” a mid-tempo comedown, constructed around a knowingly cheesy Casio beat. It’s the song that's the most indebted to Roosevelt’s 1980's soft rock influences, his voice flirting somewhat perilously with R&B inflections, wrapped in a super thick, elastic bassline. “The days are turning black\\/You’ll be sorry when you realize\\/There’s no turning back” he croons, forebodingly—and the message is clear: the sun’s rising, the party’s over, time to clean up, head back to reality.\"],[22220,\"It looks as if Japanese music from the 1980s is finally garnering more attention in the west. The closest parallel to this moment might be to the mid ’90s, when German rock and electronic music beyond Kraftwerk and the Scorpions began to gain some traction in the States thanks to some timely reissues. This access in turn allowed kosmische music to be more readily woven into the musical fabric of a new generation, and it was easy to hear the influence of Can, Faust and Neu! on the likes of Sonic Youth, Tortoise, Stereolab, Radiohead, and more. But navigating Japanese major label legalese has proven to be a stumbling block for enthusiasts hoping to bring much of this music back to light. Thankfully, last year’s reissue of Mariah’s final album Utakata No Hibi hinted that a thaw might finally be occurring. It didn’t hurt that it was an out-of-nowhere underground hit, selling out multiple pressings and landing on year-end lists, not bad for an album full of Japanese drums, skronking sax, ’80s studio slickness, and Armenian vocals. Part of Mariah’s buzz stemmed from the efforts of DJ\\/producer Chee Shimizu, known to pass copies onto his DJ friends in the west. His Obscure Sound book likely whetted appetites and added to numerous Discogs want lists searching for more of this stuff (the choicest albums on the label go for three-digit sums). Now comes More Better Days, a two-disc set pulled from the short-lived Better Days label (which originally released the Mariah record) and curated by Shimizu. An offshoot of Nippon Columbia Co, Ltd. in the late ’70s, the sub-label focused on the then-popular jazz\\/ fusion scene cropping up in the country. Ever the meticulous selector, Shimizu deep-dives into the label’s catalog and divvies up the music along two axes: Avant-Wave and Funky & Mellow. No matter your knowledge of Japanese music, the sets at the very least showcase that country’s uncanny sense of fusion, juxtaposition and impeccable aesthetics that has enchanted and informed any number of western artists, from Bowie to Grace Jones to Björk. New Age abuts blocks of jazz saxophone, shredding prog-rock guitars meets koto drumming and\\/or early drum machine skitters, while the next song might be dubbed-out disco or what that scene in Lost in Translation might have been like had Bill Murray done a karaoke version of “Lowdown.” The first disc, subtitled Avant-Wave, is the perfect entry for adventurous listeners, as almost every track presents bizarre musical connections as a matter of course. People thrilled by the manic style-mashing of Oneohtrix Point Never, Grimes, and Arca will find those artists' strange sensibilities rooted here. Saxophonist Yasuaki Shimizu’s (the man behind Mariah and the similarly revered album Kakashi) “Semi Tori No Hi” is a gentle sound bath of chimes and flutes that gets punctuated by martial snares and wobbling feedback, at once serene and destabilized. Colored Music—the lone 1981 collaboration between Atsuo Fujimoto and Ichiko Hashimoto—anticipates techno on the furious “Heartbeat,” while “Ei Sei Raku” somehow combines spiky post-punk guitars, Miles’ “Rated X” organ drones, female coos and a drum break as bombastic as anything Phil Collins did in ’80s Genesis into something coherent and cool.The furious polyrhythmic patterns of the Mkwaju Ensemble’s “Tira-Rin” and “Wood Dance” will no doubt register for a western listener as similar to Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians, a piece greatly influenced by Far East music systems like Balinese gamelan. So while it’s an exotic sound to our ears, it’s just as fascinating to hear that approach to ever-shifting rhythm and tonalities as just part of the pop fabric.Inversely, More Better Days shows what it’s like when Japanese players obsess over the likes of Steely Dan, Bob Marley, and Lalo Schifrin. “Funk Fanky” by Arakawa Band sounds like a lost ’70s cop show theme, but one that charges on for over five minutes. “Huang Di” has the bass pop of “Let’s Hear It For the Boy” before taking a sax-laced hypnagogic detour. It’s not quite as charming as it sounds. The highlights include the sleek modern funk\\/AOR of vocalist Eri Ohno and the contributions from a conga player named Pecker, whose dead-on reggae cover of Bob Marley’s “Concrete Jungle” were abetted by bringing the likes of Sly & Robbie, Aston “Family Man” Barrett and Augustus Pablo in for the session. One of the major stars to come out of the Better Days imprint was Ryuichi Sakamoto, one-time member of Yellow Magic Orchestra who went on to be an early electro icon and collaborate with the likes of Iggy Pop, David Sylvian, and Fennesz, co-starred with David Bowie on Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence and most recently, collaborated with Bryce Dessner and Alva Noto on the soundtrack for The Revenant. Sakamoto’s nearly four-decade career is irreducible, and his chameleonic spirit might be the closest to that of Bowie. It’s this changeling quality of his music that informs More Better Days: Sakamoto contributes the effervescent synth-pop of “Plastic Bamboo” and then slides into the background as accompanist on other songs, adding George Duke licks one moment while dissolving into an ambient haze on another. Sakamoto’s sound can be both instantly identifiable and obscure at once, but his music is always surprising. So it goes for the majority of the music on More Better Days, even if the biggest surprise now is that this era of Japanese pop is readily available again.\"],[22131,\"If PJ Harvey had her way, she would have made her public debut on Slint’s Spiderland. At age 20 or so, she answered the Kentucky five-piece’s call for a female backing vocalist, but never heard back. In one way, you can imagine it: both subtly violent acts from their respective south, with the accents to prove it. But even at the turn of the 1990s, the idea of Polly Jean Harvey bringing up the rear is hard to fathom—her Westcountry leer would have unleashed the devil incarnate into Slint’s whispered intimations of evil. Instead, Harvey’s debut single, which came nine months after Spiderland, in December ’91, confronted the danger of fulfilling someone else’s ideal.Released on indie label Too Pure off the back of a mailed-in demo and John Peel’s enthusiasm, “Dress” is a young woman’s desperate and naive attempt at seduction. Where riot grrrls in the Pacific Northwest were pouring acid on the grotesque mating charade, Harvey, fresh out of her first relationship, intensified the danger by playing the willing ingenue. In the song, she struggles against femininity’s constricting bodice; Eve drowning in apples, “spilling over like a heavy loaded fruit tree.” For all her efforts, it’s the wrong outfit: “‘You purdy thang,’ my man says, ‘But I bought you beautiful dresses,’” she mimics, sneering like the creep in a western. Her “clean and sparkling” dress instantly becomes a filthy rag, her identity abject: “Better get it out of this room\\/A falling woman in dancing costume.” Harvey’s identity, though, was immediately forged: Funny, furious, and capable of writing hooks—the taunted “If you put it on, if you put it on”—that burned like lit fuses. Two months later, in February 1992, Harvey followed “Dress” with second single “Sheela-Na-Gig,” a vocal tour-de-force: wheedling as she implores a man to gaze upon her “ruby-red ruby lips,” puffed up on revulsion—or is it awe?—as he dismisses her with a comparison to the titular Celtic fertility carving that depicts deranged women spreading their engorged vulvas: Her shout of “You exhibitionist!” sounds at once like a Puritan splutter and a belly laugh. She vamps through a line from South Pacific (“Gonna wash that man right outta my hair”) and has her paramor recoil at her “dirty pillows,” like the mother in Stephen King’s Carrie, reinforcing her portrayal of a young woman doomed to humiliation through mimicking the candied sexuality of films and magazines. Capable only of seeing her as virgin or whore, this guy’s dismissal is horrifying, but Harvey’s extremes make it funny, and she channels her beloved Pixies’ loud-quiet dynamic into thunderous slapstick.After just two singles, it was obvious that Harvey didn’t fit anyone’s pre-existing rock ideals. Marrying brutal heft and deft melodies, she became Britain’s first viable answer to grunge’s iconoclasts and their underground ’80s forebears. She matched Patti Smith’s incandescence, Bessie Smith’s lasciviousness, Angela Carter’s grim subversions of feminine archetypes. She outplayed everyone on Britain’s indie circuit—the long-shorted weak piss of Carter USM, Silverfish, Ned’s Atomic Dustbin—and became an instant star.Her dark humor seemed to go in tandem with her Dorset upbringing, where she wrung sheep’s testicles on her parents’ farm, cropped her hair, and peed standing up to fit in with the boys. The rest of Britain has a limited understanding of the country’s south-west, perceiving it as a desolate cultural backwater. This daring, skinny thing from the sticks fearlessly singing about sex and subjugation was a media curio. She was from the tiny village of Corscombe, but where she had come from felt like a different matter altogether.Her background offers some clues, although nothing can really account for this shy girl’s self-possessed power. Harvey’s stonemason parents had taught her to create her own culture. Her hippy mother was fed up of missing out on live music and invited rock and blues bands down to play in the local village hall—“sixth” Rolling Stone Ian Stewart was a regular visitor to the family home. The artists earned their keep by teaching the young Harvey guitar and saxophone. She had been raised listening to Captain Beefheart’s Trout Mask Replica over dinner, and Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, which upset the very young Harvey so much it soon went out of rotation. She briefly rebelled against her parents’ tastes, embracing Duran Duran for a heartbeat in her early teens, before realizing that their record collection was golden: Howlin’ Wolf, Dylan, the Stones. Carnal music fit her extreme surroundings—the sheer Jurassic coast cliff faces and easy familiarity with death on the farm. After a brief stint touring Europe with Automatic Dlamini, she quit that band to pursue her own music, planning to pack it in the following year and take up her place studying sculpture at London’s Saint Martins College. The PJ Harvey Trio were undeterred when, at their first gig, the proprietor offered them money to stop playing because everyone was leaving. (They took the cash and split.) Off the back of “Dress,” Too Pure gave her £2000 (then $5000) to make an album, and she went to the Icehouse in nearby Yeovil to record with her core band, bassist Steve Vaughan and drummer Rob Ellis.Dry is a volcano and the scorched earth surrounding it, ripped with landsliding guitars, cowpunk mania, twisted blues, profound extremes, and power chords that hit like boulders dropped from on high. She never thought she’d have the opportunity to make a record, “so I felt like I had to get everything on it as well as I possibly could, because it was probably my only chance. It felt very extreme for that reason,” she told Filter in 2004. It was also a reaction against the “lame” music around at that time, she told The Telegraph in 2001. “I’m somebody who looks for something that’s going to shock or excite me; that really shakes me up in some way inside, so you have to stop and really take a look at what you’re feeling and why you’re feeling it. And nothing was doing that for me. So I had to do it for myself.”From Dry’s first line, Harvey relishes in that ambiguity, forcing the listener to figure out what they’re feeling and why. “Ohhh myyy loverrr,” she rasps in her thick accent, as if seducing someone with her dying breath. She’s assuring her man that it’s fine for him to see another woman simultaneously, promising she’ll soak up his troubles while he can take whatever he likes: Her character understands that his time is limited, his satisfaction paramount, and that compromise is the fate of all women. The bass thuds like a domino line of falling oak trees, while a harmonium’s eerie whine makes the song feel like a dark, lost folk standard.She follows the streak of subjugation: A frenzied prayer to the Virgin Mary on “O Stella,” to guide her through the night on “Dress.” Then comes “Victory,” where she’s a post-punk Vera Lynn lustily imploring the boys to “sweat, dig—I’ll mop it right off your brow.” On the earthy lurch of “Happy and Bleeding” she loses her virginity and turns from fresh fruit to rotten peach both “long overdue” and “too early,” her “idle hole” then rejected on “Sheela-Na-Gig.” That’s the first half of Dry: blitzing the rigged path young women must walk from innocence to sullied castoff. It’s rife with disappointment and violence, but Harvey treats the double standard for the absurd cabaret it is, making perfect sense of it through her formative blues vocabulary. She plays victim in her words and aggressor with her guitar, adopting a libidinous swagger that’s as nasty and thrilling as the abuser who keeps her coming back for more. Nobody sings like PJ Harvey sings on Dry, veering perilously (but exactingly) between wheedling, raging, vamping, always with a sly wink.These extreme contrasts confused critics at the time: Dry played like a feminist statement but she refused the label, wondering why anyone remarked on her sexual lyrics when plenty of rock and blues bands had gone further before her. Mostly dressed in black, her hair scraped back severely, she seemed to eschew image, but then posed topless on the cover of NME. She insisted that there was no depth to the lyrics, and professed to being baffled by people’s attempts to interpret them, but her considered use of female archetypes to depict a woman’s fall and subsequent vengeance told a different story. All of these things were true at once, part of her distancing push-and-pull. As she told Spin in ’93, “The biggest protection you can have is if people think they’ve got you and they haven’t got you at all.”She pulls the same trick on Dry’s scumbag subject, going into the record's vengeful second half. She’s Delilah to his Samson on “Hair,” flattering him into submission and cutting off his mane. “I’ll keep it safe,” she sings, sounding emboldened by power, before flipping on a knife edge, realizing: “You’re mine.” The bass zooms as if mapping the swift transfer of power; the rhythm section pounds like Samson’s impotent rage. “Joe” is the record’s most manic moment. There’s no quiet-loud shift, just pure piledriver dynamics as she spits nails at the treachery she’s experienced: “Always thought you’d come rushing in to clear the shit out of my eye\\/Joe, ain’t you my buddy, thee?”But rather than commit bloody murder as you might expect, she retreats on “Plants and Rags,” “[easing] myself into a body bag,” and finding solace at home: “Who thought they could take away that place?” she asks as the violin swirls to a deranged squall. Her love of Slint comes through on the menacing fretboard harmonics of “Fountain,” where she washes herself clean and a Jesus-like figure shrouds her modesty in leaves. On “Water,” her first utterance of the word sounds like she’s dying of thirst. By the chorus, when she’s walked into the sea, invoking Mary and Jesus again, she sounds as though the crashing waves are emanating from her own throat.Critics have theorized that she drowns herself at the end of the album, to rid the shame from her body. But it sounds more like a rebirth; the cure to her dryness, finding satisfaction on her own terms and eradicating the need she had looked to someone else to fill. Dry is an exciting, scary joyride through the dawning realization that learning to please yourself yields far greater pleasure than relying on others to do it for you: These gory myths are her lover’s discourse, an apocalypse—in the revelatory sense—that she would push even further on 1993’s Rid of Me (after her immediate fame resulted in a nervous breakdown). Following the NYC gloss of 2000’s Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea, she attempted to tap back into this sound on 2004’s Uh Huh Her, but the lack of her debut’s extreme urgency limited its success. On Dry, Harvey’s character may appear to subjugate her gratification, but it’s all there, bursting out in the zeal of her playing.“It’s the same kind of excitement, playing music, as in a sexual relationship, and the two go hand-in-hand,” she told a French TV show in ’93. “And I think I find music physically exciting as well—actually playing loud music and standing in front of a bass amplifier is quite a sexual experience, I think.” She tells a story about playing in Chicago, and how every time Steve Vaughan hit an A, she got vibrations right up to her middle. “Wonderful,” she muses. “We play a lot of songs in A as well, so it was a good night.” The French journalist gurgles like a stunned baby, unable to process this frank, feral waif who’s got it all figured out.\"],[22221,\" You can’t find “Duffle Bag Boy” legally. The song, which hit #15 on Billboard back in the fall of ’07, doesn’t exist on iTunes, Apple Music, Spotify, or Tidal. (There’s a rip of the music video on Youtube, but it’s censored and missing the intro where Lil Wayne says “Weed and syrup ’til I die…as a matter of fact it’s gon’ kill me.”) In fact, almost the entire Playaz Circle catalog, the duo 2 Chainz got his start in during the 2000s when he still went by Tity Boi, was scrubbed from streaming services some time in the last four years, presumably due to a copyright claim against the duo’s name. So if you’re just tuning in, it might look like 2 Chainz crawled out of the darkness in 2011, fully formed, drinking champagne on the airplane. But that couldn’t be further from the truth.For one, 2 Chainz knows how fortunate he is. Daniel Son ; Necklace Don, his third project this year, is informed—at points consumed—by the circumstances in which Tauheed Epps grew up. From “Ghetto”: “Used to stay with my cousins, heat the house up with the oven\\/Airport tried to make us move without paying us\\/We told ’em, ‘We ain’t budging.’” At the end of that song, he gives a quick monologue where he says he’s “thankful for everything that [he’s] been through, for every seed that’s been planted.” And that’s what makes his insane, Technicolor flossing so joyous—it’s grounded in grainy cartoons watched over stolen cable.That’s not to say 2 Chainz is a stickler for realism. DS ; ND has rims on ambulances, weddings at Benihanas, condos on Jupiter. He buys mansions just to shoot dice in; he leaves his mom’s house with a thousand Nikes. Or maybe he’s at Waffle House, snapping you back to real life: “Patty melt with the hash browns, trying to avoid all the pat-downs.” The last quote is from “Big Amount,” which sounds like you’re playing Ocarina of Time deep in College Park. After 2 Chainz wears Yeezys to dinner and honks at pedestrians and pours water (Voss only, nothing less) on women, Drake pops up with his best verse all year. He raps about not wanting to rap, calls himself “a J. Prince investment,” is visited by the ghost of Michael Jackson, pays tribute to Bankroll Fresh, and has a nervous breakdown when someone suggests staying at the Marriott. It’s funny, it’s specific, it’s vivid—because when you’re rapping next to 2 Chainz, you don’t have a choice. Speaking generally, it’s tough to rap through middle age. (Nas might be the only famous rapper to succeed in dealing with that transition in long form.) Those who enjoy do critical success on the other side of 40 tend to be narrow-lensed specialists like Raekwon, or to be totally unmoored from questions of time or conventional identity like DOOM or Aesop Rock. 2 Chainz is joining that short list because his style is equal parts daring and durable: he’s going to write the most distinct, disorienting, and immutably fun verses in the entire genre. And he’s developed into an excellent technician. On “Get Out the Bed,” the passage “Gladiator, tell your neighbor\\/Gun on table, Buick LeSabre\\/Do ya now, do ya later\\/Dice game, pool table\\/Two flavors, too anxious” is razor-sharp, as is “Kilo” or the YFN Lucci-assisted “You in Luv Wit Her.” But again, 2 Chainz isn’t going to leave the past behind. The tape’s penultimate song, the DJ Spinz-produced “Blessing,” blends the excess with heartbreak. It opens: “When I’m alone in my room, sometimes it look like the mall\\/In the back of my mind, I ball harder than y’all\\/I used to have an old school that I sat on some dubs\\/For the first time in my life, mama knew I sold drugs.” It’s the at-what-cost moment that bridges cold nights from his childhood with the gloss of the present. Unsurprisingly, 2 Chainz brings it to life the way few others could. \"],[22247,\"The Chills took seven years to make their first full album, 1987’s Brave Words—seven years of false starts, constantly shifting lineups, and one tragedy that nearly destroyed the band and ended up cementing its virtues. Singer\\/guitarist Martin Phillipps’ group was at the forefront of the extraordinary little guitar-pop scene in New Zealand in the early ’80s—connected to bands like the Clean, the Verlaines, Tall Dwarfs, and Look Blue Go Purple—and Kaleidoscope World is the major document of their early era. It’s a Katamari of an album, picking up another few songs every time a new edition comes out; since its initial appearance in 1986, it’s progressively bulked up from eight songs to this version’s 24.The early Chills were inspired by the garage rock of the mid-’60s—their trebly organ sound was usually right out front—and by Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd. But they were gentler and sadder and persistently obsessed with mortality. Phillipps was a prolific songwriter early on, so the band had a substantial repertoire by the time they released their first records in 1982: a shared EP with three other bands from Dunedin, followed by the tormented but chipper single “Rolling Moon.” (“Please oh God don’t take us home,” the chorus went.)A couple of weeks after “Rolling Moon,” they recorded a basic track for the haunted, keening “Pink Frost,” as part of a proposed EP of songs with colors in their titles. Phillipps was dissatisfied with the results, but before they could re-record it, the Chills’ new drummer Martyn Bull fell ill, and the band went on hiatus. Bull died of leukemia a year later; subsequently, Phillipps completed that original recording, exquisitely, and assembled a new version of the Chills. “Pink Frost” became their best-known song, inspiring the names of a band and a Fugazi song. And, although Bull had really only played with the band for a couple of months, his death became the specter haunting the rest of their existence, and the muted, cavernous tone of “Pink Frost” carried over to their next few records.“Pink Frost” actually made the Top 20 in New Zealand—not bad for an indie band—and so did its follow-up, “Doledrums,” a cheerful readymade about life on unemployment. That’s where the first iteration of Kaleidoscope World ended, as a brief set of eight songs by a curious little band with an impressive live reputation. Over the next few years, other material from the same era started getting tacked on to it: some live tracks, The “Lost” EP (six featherweight songs from the “Doledrums” period), and “I Love My Leather Jacket,” a 1986 glam-stomp single about Phillipps’ keepsake from Martyn Bull. The new additions to the album’s 2016 incarnation are a brief piano instrumental called “Martyn’s Doctor Told Me,” the frazzled rocker “Smile from a Dead Dead Face,” and early takes of a pair of songs the Chills re-recorded later on, including another premonition of doom, “Dan Destiny and the Silver Dawn.” (All four are flown in from 2001’s Secret Box, a three-disc collection of live stuff and oddities.)Phillipps had evidently been saving his more “writerly” songs for an album—Brave Words and 1990’s lush major-label follow-up Submarine Bells foreground his voice and lyrics much more than these songs do. In fact, the remarkable thing about Kaleidoscope World, given the band’s subsequent reputation as a singer-songwriter vehicle, is how much more of its focus is on the Chills’ sound than on Phillipps’ songwriting. “Purple Girl” is a near-instrumental in the mode of some of the Clean’s minor-key jams; “Bite” is a ridiculous jeremiad directed at an overeater (“You gotta bite that food! You gotta get it inside you!”). “Hidden Bay” is a tiny sliver of a song (written and sung by bassist Martin Kean, who passed through the Chills on his way to Stereolab) that mostly just flexes the band’s live muscle. That kind of silliness and spontaneity would mostly be absent from the Chills’ later recordings; Phillipps’ growing earnestness served the band magnificently for a few years, but then over-ripened. As he was ravaged by drugs and illness, his output slowed to a drip. The Chills have, surprisingly, had a stable lineup since 2009, but last year’s Silver Bullets was one of only two full-length albums of new songs that they’ve managed to complete in the past two decades. They weren’t able to live up to the promise of Kaleidoscope World in the long term, but its playful melancholy and somber chime still glisten like sunlight on weathered ice.\"],[22198,\"It’s always risky when a young artist opens an album with an unexpected gambit that either sounds remarkably better or different than the rest of the songs that follow. Going for the shock of the new is understandable, but there’s the danger that listeners could fall in love with that first moment and then become disappointed when the rest of the record fails to stack up. Such is the case with Golden Sings That Have Been Sung, the third studio album by Illinois guitar wunderkind Ryley Walker. On his past two records, Walker fetishized the sounds and aesthetics of quasi-mystical British folk of the late 1960s and early ’70s; everything about 2015’s Primrose Green, from the songs, to Walker’s vocals, to even the photography and font on the album cover screamed “revivalist.” However, on Golden Sings opener “The Halfwit in Me,” Walker tones down those influences while shifting things back home to the late ’90s baroque folk of Chicago artists like Gastr del Sol and Jim O’Rourke. The song pulls from the successful elements of Walker’s previous work while embracing these newer (albeit still “retro”) influences and melding it all into a beautiful, pensive six-minute suite that seems to declare the official arrival of an artist who’s on his own path.Unfortunately, none of the other seven songs on Golden Sings sound anything like “The Halfwit in Me.” Part of what makes that track successful is the way Walker uses his spindling guitar melodies to carry it forward at a brisk clip, showcasing delicate instrumental interplay and allowing his serviceable voice to complement rather than dominate the song. Disappointingly, four of Golden Sings’s eight cuts slow things down to a dirge-like pace that de-emphasizes the value of his playing. These songs also put his voice and lyrics front and center—like he’s hoping to dazzle us with the strength and passion of his pipes and the inspired poetry they sing, a la Van Morrison. But while Walker’s vocals are considerably improved from Primrose Green, they’re still more equipped to serve as an accompaniment rather than the star of his music.Also, considering Walker’s rep as a guitar savant, the decision to minimize the fancy playing is a bit of a head scratcher. On the piano-driven “Funny Thing She Said,” the weakness is especially apparent as the song just crawls and bores. Additionally, the languidness draws undue attention to Walker’s occasionally overwrought lyrics, which often just hang and die in the air awkwardly. In light of these glacial jeremiads, the buoyant, saccharine folk-pop of “I Will Ask You Twice” feels almost desperately welcome, despite the fact that it more or less sounds like an outtake from Jewel’s Pieces of You.It’s not all glum though. Golden Sings offers one other winning track with the bright and beautiful “The Roundabout.” Setting the stage with a warm, slightly droning guitar riff, the song succeeds at advancing Walker’s desire to position himself as a successor to the British folk legends he so obviously loves. Relating a tale of the comforting time spent at reliable local bar, the repeating guitar line emphasizes the sort of hypnotic brainlock that a powerful moment of nostalgia can offer. He succeeds lyrically as well, with amusing lines like, “I want to buy you a drink, but my credit is quit shit\\/We can all laugh and have tap water.”It’s evident that Walker is talented and brimming with ideas—and there are moments on this record that mark the best music he’s ever made. But he needs to get a better understanding of his strengths if he wants to become more than just another nifty live-guitar throwback.\"],[22214,\"One Saturday in 1994, a pair of recent college graduates wandered into the Yohji Yamamoto store in SoHo, on the corner of Grand and Mercer. Neither was buying anything. One, who took inspiration from New York club kids, was drawn to the outlandish shapes and imaginative draping; the other was simply tagging along for the ride, and felt more than a little overwhelmed by the fields upon fields of black, not to mention the astronomical price tags hanging from the garments. I know this, because I was that cowed young man. The music in the store that day also reminded me of space, and when I inquired about the shimmering electronic soundtrack, a clerk told me it was something called the 7th Plain. Despite the fact that the name sounded more like a cult than a musician, I hightailed it to Mondo Kim’s, where I plunked down $24 for My Yellow Wise Rug, an import CD that looked unlike any other I had ever purchased, packaged in a wide, flat cardboard box and emblazoned with a yellow “magic eye” illustration that I have never, ever managed to decipher, all these years later.I recount the story because it might be hard to imagine, 22 years later, how alien that kind of music once sounded, especially in the United States. It was techno, but it wasn't really made for dancing; it was ambient, but it definitely wasn’t made for spas. It sounded like the future, and you were unlikely to hear music of its ilk anywhere on the airwaves, save perhaps for a few broadcasts on the far left of the dial. And while Luke Slater, the British artist behind the project, had recorded plenty of the raw, pile-driving techno then in favor in the rave scenes on both sides of the Atlantic, the heady, ethereal bent of the 7th Plain remained a niche concern.Slater only released two albums and a handful of EPs under his 7th Plain alias, all between 1993 and 1995 and all of it on General Production Recordings, an ambient techno label that was home to artists like the Black Dog and Beaumont Hannant. (A third 7th Plain album, 1996’s Playing With Fools, never made it past the test-pressing stage, and the label shut down the same year). Slater has continued to record, though most of his subsequent output has been sterner and steelier than his halcyon 7th Plain music. He released a string of albums under his own name on Mute and NovaMute around the turn of the millennium, and since 2009, he has focused largely on his aliases L.B. Dub Corp and Planetary Assault Systems, recording a number of records for Ostgut Ton, the label arm of Berlin’s Berghain club. Chronicles I kicks off a new sub-label, A-TON, and in keeping with the imprint’s archival bent, it concentrates on out-of-print and previously unreleased 7th Plain material.The best of it still sounds as otherworldly as it did more than two decades ago. “Boundaries,” from My Yellow Wise Rug, has all the widescreen grandeur of a sci-fi blockbuster as it unfurls rippling synth leads over cymbal flashes and a quietly dramatic ostinato pulse. “Extra (the 7th Plain Remix)” is a rework of a Ken Ishii track from 1995 that was originally released under Slater‘s own name, and has apparently been grandfathered into the 7th Plain catalog; balancing eerie, mercurial chords with hammering hi-hats and snares, it sounds like a steel-girded fog bank, and it exemplifies how the 7th Plain often borrowed from harder strains of techno in creating otherwise atmospheric music. “Grace” and “Surface Bound” both come from 1994’s The 4 Cornered Room. Like “Boundaries,” their layers upon layers of synthesizers seem to vibrate in the air, luminous and metallic. They are largely beatless, and their vivid timbres go to the heart of the 7th Plain’s greatest quality: his incredibly rich, sumptuous chords, each one composed of so many discrete tones that they become almost impossible to parse.The album’s four remaining tracks seem to be previously unreleased cuts. One, “the Super 8,” is sweeping ambient techno in the vein of My Yellow Wise Rug, all cycling arpeggios and choral pads. “T Funk States” is taut, squelchy techno that sounds more in keeping with Slater’s other aliases. “Slip 7 Sideways” is a drowsy stretch of slowed-down breakbeats that's reminiscent of DJ Shadow or Urban Tribe, and stands as a reminder of hip-hop’s influence on early techno. The final cut, “Chords Are Dirty,” is an impressionistic miniature for a single synthesizer; the background hum suggests that it might be a rough sketch. As an album, Chronicles I doesn’t hold up as well as either of the 7th Plain’s original albums, and it seems strange that it cherry-picks so sparingly from them. It would have been nice had A-TON simply reissued My Yellow Wise Rug and The 4 Cornered Room and included the unreleased material as bonus cuts. Still, as an introduction to one of ambient techno’s relatively unsung heroes, Chronicles I provides a valuable service. The best cuts here rank alongside contemporary material from Aphex Twin, the Black Dog, Sun Electric, and other pioneers of ambient techno. And while it might not sound as unprecedented today as it did in 1994, it’s still capable of opening a passageway to other worlds.\"],[22185,\"In stark defiance of pop music’s “don’t bore us, get to the chorus” maxim, John Dwyer believes the best antidote to boredom is getting rid of the chorus altogether. Rather than introduce a rousing, anthemic melody to elevate a song to the next level, Dwyer takes the shortcut to ecstasy: after riding a relentless robo-punk rhythm through a couple of creepily cooed verses, he simply screams “wooo!,” and uses his fuzzbox as a springboard into the stratosphere. At this point in the band’s 11-album run, you can pretty much set your watch to this maneuver—A Weird Exits’ pulsating opener, “Dead Man’s Gun,” dutifully triggers its strobe-lit squall at the 40-second mark. But the trick never fails to exhilarate, because Thee Oh See’s blast-off moments never feel like smooth, assured ascents—they’re more like riding a whirling fairground attraction and realizing your safety belt has come unlatched. Even as recent albums have introduced stoner-prog jams and Mellotron-swirled ballads into the mix, Thee Oh Sees have become, as John Peel famously quipped about the Fall, one of those “always different, always the same” kinda bands. With each hastily released album, you’re guaranteed a healthy dose of the band’s patented motorik mayhem, but in Thee Oh Sees’ case, that signature sound is no dead end—it functions more as a home base from which the band can confidently roam and to which it can safely circle back. A Weird Exits doesn’t make any surprise detours like Drop’s Beatlesque lullaby “The Lens” or Mutilator Defeated At Last’s psych-folk pastorale “Holy Smoke”; rather than slam on the brakes and pull a U, it gradually eases off the accelerator. But while raygunned rave-ups like “Gelatinous Cube” will keep the stagedivers busy at the band’s legendarily unhinged live shows, more than ever, Thee Oh Sees show an eagerness to drift away from their foundational ’60s psych-pop and garage-punk roots into more cosmic realms. And, as this album proves, you can venture even further afield when you have two drummers powering the ship.A Weird Exits is Thee Oh Sees’ first LP to showcase the double-thump tandem of Ryan Moutinho and Dan Rincon, whose interplay naturally encourages a greater degree of rhythmic variation. While Krautrock remains the driving force in Thee Oh Sees machine, the guiding spirit here is more Jaki Liebezeit than Klaus Dinger, with a premium on loose, limber mid-tempo grooves instead of locked-in momentum. That balming effect can be felt even on a windmilled exercise like “Plastic Plant,” which has all the qualities of a classic Oh Sees rocker, yet opts for a cool shuffle instead of a full-torque thrust. But the double-barreled attack is most potent on the instrumentals: the punnily titled “Jammed Entrance” etches a squiggly morse-code keyboard pattern into a mushroom-heady funk; the jazzy guitar refrains of “Unwrap the Fiend Pt. 2” give way to a taut, tambourine-shakin’ strut and phased-out solo that open up a vast, spectral sense of space. (By contrast, the droning eight-minute reverie “Crawl Out From the Fall Out,” doesn’t give the drummers much to do other than tentatively tap their cymbals, but then its swirling, lung-engulfing Spacemen 3-via-“Ode to Street Hassle” haze is too thick to encourage much muscle movement.)As Thee Oh Sees are wont to do, they close A Weird Exits with a slow dance—though it’s the rare one in their canon to push the VU meter to the same extremes as their high-octane ragers. With its mournful, church-organ melody, “The Axis” initially waltzes in like a dirtbag “Whiter Shade of Pale,” the romantic yearning replaced by scathing anti-sentiment (“Don’t you know how much \\/ I don’t love you”). But, in its dying moments, Dwyer unleashes a squealing, distorted guitar solo: Even when their pendulum is swinging at a steadier pace, Thee Oh Sees still have the power to hypnotize—but from its twitchy jams to its blown-out power ballads, A Weird Exits’ most intriguing moments come when they break the trance.\"],[22207,\"Toro Y Moi isn’t exactly the first artist you would imagine releasing a live album recorded in the middle of a desert. His catalog, now seven albums deep, evolved from an intimate version of bedroom-pop that was one of the foundations of chillwave, through 2015’s What For?, an uneven pastiche of guitar rock informed by ’70s adult contemporary as much as it was by Weezer. (There’s even a rap-influenced mixtape in there somewhere.)A “live album from Toro Y Moi” makes sense, then, when you consider Live from Trona wasn’t recorded from an actual concert or festival appearance: rather, the show was performed in front of no one, amidst the beautiful landscape of Trona—three hours away from Los Angeles and a town home to about 3,000—the perfect showcase for a set of Bundick’s laidback tunes.Still, how does the beatmaker and songwriter translate live? In a live club setting, it works, because small, indoor venues amplify his layered, dense rhythms that propel his post-2011 output (and accentuate his penchant for catchy, striking riffs). But how does it work from the middle of a canyon? Bundick circumvents this by crafting a set that mostly sticks to the guitar-laden What For?.This accomplishes a few things: it gives those songs, from an album that didn’t crack the critical accolades of his previous work and was mostly seen as a mild disappointment, a second life. It also fleshes them out in the way only a live performance can. What For’s biggest problem was it didn’t rock: while his demo June 2009, re-released in 2012, also didn’t rock, it was more of a power-pop record, an early recording that made its sins easy to forgive. What For’s smooth adult contemporary sound was five years after “Round and Round” and felt regressive after Bundick created his most dense, funkiest, and obviously Dilla-inspired record with 2013’s sublime Anything in Return.It’s easy to enjoy Live from Trona as a What For? Part Deux, then, which is to Bundick’s benefit, as his catalog is pretty much bulletproof, with that album his most obvious weak link. Seven of those songs appear here, and they serve as the record’s best run as they sound the most appropriate in the desert. “Still Sound,” a stellar track and stand-out from 2011’s Underneath the Pine, feels limp and exposed live, its crunchy guitar riff in the studio withering outdoors, like a high-res photograph that’s been compressed. (“Say That” escapes mostly unscathed.) This is unfortunately a pitfall of Bundick’s music—if you remove the studio-enhanced sheen, the nostalgic production touches that give his best albums (Underneath the Pine, the Freaking Out EP, Anything in Return) their unique aura—is this some great, unheard, funky Todd Rundgren album?—you’re left with something tepid, like What For?.The record’s lone new song, “JBS,” featuring jazz duo Mattson 2, has some inspired jamming, but at six-and-a-half minutes, is too long. It’s the kind of thing that might have sounded fantastic if you were there (ironic, considering no one was), but loses its immediacy in recorded form. It’s also the album’s most dangerous turn into self-indulgence, which, to its credit, Live from Trona successfully avoids. The set closes with What For’s pensive closer, “Yeah Right,” which reads likes an artistic statement; it’s a Dear John letter to chillwave. “Who are your new friends? Why did you bring them?” is a subtly devastating line, the kind of thing that stings the most when you resent someone closest to you, and the song, stretched to seven minutes to cap the live set, hits even harder in this version. It feels like Bundick, who will turn 30 in November, is closing the door on the youth-oriented movement he helped ignite back in 2010.Few live albums are truly essential, and Live from Trona isn’t, either. But by tackling some of his least-loved songs head-on as the centerpiece of this record, Bundick shows a continued willingness to tinker with his work until he’s completely satisfied with the final product, which has been a hallmark of his career. Live from Trona also asks you to consider Bundick’s artistic output as a whole: by exploring sounds we never would have expected to hear from him in 2010, he’s continually evolving. The album leaves you wondering what his next pivot could be.\"],[22189,\"To date, Factory Floor have appeared in a state of constant flux, each successive release resembling a snapshot taken on the eve of a new mutation. Beginning as a claustrophobic post-punk band in 2008, their accelerated evolution has seen the North Londoners graduate through Chris & Cosey-style industrial dance, white-hot analog synth attacks, hi-NRG acid traxx, and New Order-indebted dance pop. The main point of continuity has been a manic energy that lingers somewhere between the ecstatic and the oppressive.True to form, 25 25, the group’s second long-player for DFA, marks the start of a new phase. Following 2013’s Factory Floor, modular synth player Dominic Butler quit the band—he now records thumping dance as part of the Diagonal-signed Bronze Teeth—leaving just the core duo of Gabriel Gurnsey and Nik Colk Void. This slimmed-down line-up means the Factory Floor of 25 25 feels less like a live rock band than ever before. Their post-punk past has dissolved into extended hardware dance pieces characterized by monomaniacal repetition and stiff, grid-like precision.Repetition has always been a part of the Factory Floor user’s manual, but here it appears to have become the guiding principle. A single acid gurgle loops throughout the eight-and-a-half minute opener “Meet Me at the End,” and while other sounds enter play—blocks of brittle handclaps, treble-boosted synths, and a ghostly voice commanding the listener to “work… work… work… work”—its abiding feel is one of confinement or suspension, of being trapped in a groove. A similar sense of limbo permeates “Relay” and “Dial Me In,” which rearrange a small palette of synths, hi-hats, and drums interminably.Such commitment to sparsity is evidently the result of aesthetic decision rather than low horizons. Gurnsey and Void have talked in interviews about paring back their music to bare necessities, and here any dynamic that feels surplus to requirements—which includes verses, choruses, drops, and breakdowns—has been ruthlessly expunged. This forced austerity even extends to Void’s vocals, which appear as fragments, often treated or time-stretched—perhaps a nod to the days when samplers could capture just a couple of seconds of low bit-rate audio.Even working within these self-imposed strictures, 25 25 is in places very good. “Ya” is the highlight, a fusion of jackin house and ’80s industrial dance that recalls New Order’s “Blue Monday.” It builds around a simple formula, but tosses in all manner of little tricks and flourishes—flurries of clacking woodblock, a sick acid line, a tom-tom roll dispatched with the flick of a wrist. (It definitely helps if you picture the vocal line as a laconic German robot sending up LCD Soundsystem’s “Yeah,” a sly little acknowledgement of the DFA pedigree.) “Slow Listen” filters an admonishing female vocal through groans of hoover bass and piston-pumping snare, while “Wave” is a slow-burner that builds elegant lattices of percussion, even as it bores down hard on one chord. But ultimately—at least placed next to Factory Floor’s largely excellent earlier records—25 25 feels a little undercooked. It is tirelessly energetic, but often in a brute, functional way. And while it works just great on a treadmill or running machine—I checked—I’m not sure that alone constitutes success on an artistic level. Revisit older Factory Floor tracks like “A Wooden Box” or “(R E A L L O V E)” and there remains something tantalizing there—the way they morph back and forth between live band and broiling techno, a trompe l’oeil for the ear. On 25 25, they’ve shed this dimension, and the results can feel depthless and a little flat. Pare back and pare back and pare back, and eventually you’re left with a blank canvas. Hopefully now, Factory Floor will figure out how to fill it anew.\"],[22240,\"TheMIND (real name Zarif Wilder) bides his time floating between two Chicago worlds: He has backing vocals on Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book and appeared on SaveMoney Crew affiliate’s projects like Joey Purp’s excellent iiiDrops and Noname’s Telefone, and Chance-compatriots Donnie Trumpet and Knox Fortune make appearances on his debut project Summer Camp, which snuck out into the world last June. But he made a name for himself before that, as a member of production collective THEMpeople, producing songs for Mick Jenkins and guesting on his albums (along with other auxiliary members of this scene, Sean Deaux and Saba). It’s an easy-but-accurate comparison to place theMIND in this world: maybe it’s the tone of his voice more than his lyrical content, but he’s this scene’s Frank Ocean.Summer Camp isn’t Nostalgia, Ultra, though, even though I think it aspires to be, with its vaguely conceptual narrative (songs that play in a car as a couple vacillate between talking and arguing) and snippets of tracks that filter in and out of focus like a dream (or a channel surfer). But its biggest strengths lie elsewhere—theMIND is a gifted producer, and the way he’s constructed this record is less like some alt-R&B throwaway mixtape and more like a cavernous, meandering album.A whistling tea kettle sets things off on opener “Summer Camp” before the song finds the album’s cushiest groove. A headphone-friendly nocturnal mood, consuming the album like embers around a campfire, is established: “Run through the woods if the rain comes\\/cover your head ’til the pain numbs\\/lose it all in the earth, leave your tears in the dirt\\/fall in love ’til it hurts\\/we young,” works the same wistful, doomed-young-romance lane Ocean has trafficked in since 2011 (if not recently). It’s not the most subtle stuff, but the pleasures of Summer Camp reside in Wilder’s ability to conjure a mood with his production, then sell the emotion with the most direct line of songwriting.“Pale Rose” is the single, and it’s less effective, a propulsive, “I Would Die 4 U”-type beat that suffers from a generic, overwrought bridge: “Hey you\\/right over there\\/who even loves\\/who even cares?” It’s the growing pains of a songwriter still trying to reach his final form. On the brisk “In Peace,” an introspective, neo-soul-esque production that would slot nicely onto Jamila Woods’ HEAVN, Wilder hits his deepest nerve: “My granny told me read my Bible\\/as I start to daydream\\/I see it all in HD\\/we’re bigger than they told us we were.” On the Noname-assisted “Only the Beginning,” he adopts a husky, sing-song Isaiah Rashad flow: “I often sweat when haunted nightly by regret like\\/why I didn’t kill that nigga when my sister told me what he did to her?” He rambles a bit more about his sister, but never hits the detail of what happened to her—he’s yet to develop a songwriter’s storytelling instinct, but he’s attempting to tap into that vein.Wilder’s gift is to summon some of the magic of guys like Ocean, Rashad, and Chance, but it’s also a curse, because you can more easily chart out how much more maturing he has to do before he can hang with them. All said, Summer Camp is one of the summer’s few surprises, a low-stakes album available for free, the late night stoner’s LP we didn’t know we needed. If you like Mick Jenkins but wished his songs were a little lighter, or if you want to hear an earnest young Chicago artist find his voice without literally sounding like Chance, theMIND’s Summer Camp is a pleasant place to stop in.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this review incorrectly identified theMIND as a member of Chance the Rapper’s SaveMoney Crew. It has been amended.\"],[22150,\"Kevin Barnes is done chasing listeners away, at least for the time being. After pruning his fan base with a run of increasingly fussy, exhausting records, lately the capricious Of Montreal frontman has been attempting to widen the tent again. 2013’s Lousy with Sylvianbriar was the band’s most inviting effort since their 2007 consensus high watermark Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer, and with its grimy ’70s rock aesthetic and openhearted account of Barnes’ divorce, 2015’s Aureate Gloom was as direct as anything he’d done in a decade. It seems that when Barnes’ personal relationships are in shambles he compensates in the studio by dialing back some of his more alienating impulses, and apparently he’s still reeling from his divorce, because even more so than the last two, the band’s 14th record Innocence Reaches craves approval.  Like most Of Montreal LPs, Innocence Reaches arrives with a hook: It’s the band’s first to dip its toe in contemporary EDM. With its springy, raved-up synths and Calvin Harris tempos, opener “Let’s Relate” teases a spectacular reinvention, while Barnes nods to shifting gender norms with a distinctly 21st century pickup line: “How do you identify?” Challenging gender binaries is nothing new for Barnes, who was prancing around stages in pantyhose back in the mid-’00s, when indie-rock was at its most heteronormative, but the pulsing production seems to invigorate him. He draws out syllables just to savor the moment. Even during his Georgie Fruit phase he rarely sounded quite this liberated.  The electronic makeover is such a flattering look for the band that it’s a shame Barnes didn’t run with it. Though contemporary sounds dot the record, especially the bottom-heavy splatter of “A Sport and a Pastime” and “Trashed Exes,” both of which play like remixes of themselves, Barnes mostly defaults to his go-to muses, Prince and David Bowie, filtering them through his usual prism of funhouse psychedelia. It’s not that any of it misses its mark. “Chaos Arpeggiating” rides a frisky, seriously hummable Ziggy Stardust riff, but we’ve heard Barnes do this kind of thing so many times before, and it sounds that much staler because it follows something we haven’t.   And after a pair of encouraging bounce-back records, Barnes has begun to fall back on some bad habits. Lousy with Sylvianbriar and Aureate Gloom were each recorded with a full band, and Gloom in particular fed on that live energy. The same band is credited on Innocence Reaches, too, but they aren’t nearly the presence here—it sure sounds like Barnes recorded most of it alone, with the same tinker-and-paste ProTools approach that made Paralytic Stalks such a slog. As outgoing as the record tries to be (and it really, really tries), it can’t shake that particular sense of claustrophobia endemic to any full-length where the singer insists on doing his own backing vocals.   That’s one lesson Barnes never learned from Prince or Bowie, both artists who, for all their leading-man charisma, understood the value of collaboration. Each assembled ace bands and made records that felt like group efforts, yet Barnes’ approach is far more rigid. His albums are very much the work and vision of one man, and so even on a relatively easygoing outing like Innocence Reaches, that insularity can grow stifling. It’s as if since Barnes can’t escape his own head, he won’t allow listeners to, either.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this review misinterpreted a lyric from the song “Let’s Relate;” it has been amended.\"],[22197,\"DJ Snake is a young French DJ and producer best known for his endless sugar high of a song “Turn Down for What,” and, up until now, his big moments have felt worth the tooth rot. Other big time producers from, Afrojack to Zedd, make mostly humorless music. Their drops and major keys work for clubs of course, with huge dynamic shifts that play to the pit of your stomach the same way a roller coaster does. The genius of them is they also work for partying on a smaller scale, like for at-home pregaming. EDM’s lack of subtlety isn’t a fault—it’s the entire point. For the genre, you can often replace questions of “good” and bad” with “useful” or “useless.” EDM is a tool as much as it is a type of music. DJ Snake has taken EDM’s inherent grandeur and played around in its sandbox. “Turn Down for What,” especially, turned the dial past eleven. Its over the top aggression is written into its rhythms. The song has Lil Jon barking at you. It’s ludicrous, and excellently so. After billions of of plays, it’s still not old, as it well overshoots its modest ambitions. In other words, at his best, DJ Snake under-promises and over-delivers. Unfortunately, we don’t get much of DJ Snake at his best on Encore. Clearly DJ Snake has the ability to make some serious earworms: “Sahara,” with Skrillex, adds an element of surprise, in the form of tablas and chanting. It’s got a predictable buildup and inevitable drop, before some very “Turn Down” esque synth jabs take over. It’s dumb fun. “Ocho Cinco,” the album’s most successfully ridiculous track, mostly eschews vocals (like “Sahara”) and utilizes what basically sounds like a nail gun for most of its drums. It sounds appropriate for driving your car into a wall. Same with “Propaganda,” which follows a similar formula of exuberant pummelling. But instead of just riding out that vim and vigor, he looks to make a real album, more songs with choruses and verses. Why? There’s a fish with a bicycle comparison to be made here. The album is simply not the format for DJ Snake. The conventional song barely is. He makes tracks. Instead of being, at least, a collection of great, standalone singles, the album is riddled with ill-advised rap songs and bad ballads. At best, “Let Me Love You,” the collaboration with Justin Bieber (who knows his way around silly EDM beats) is forgettable. Jeremih, on “The Half” sounds half awake on the beat’s video game bloops. Closer “Here Comes the Night” with Mr. Hudson is actually pretty good in that slick Ryan-Gosling-movie-credits way. But how a clunker like “Future Pt 2” with limp vocals from Bipolar Sunshine ended up next to these songs is anyone’s guess. Can no one working on these records tell how bad they are? Ultimately, the question that remains with Encore is really just: Why does this exist? The party tracks on here are exceptional at doing what they do. The guy can make a banger. Surely those songs would have the life they deserve on computer screens and in subwoofers however they’re released. The “Turn Down for What” video has half a billion YouTube views! It’s digestible. In what way does an uneven album help DJ Snake or his fans? Is his ambition to be a producer and songwriter? It probably shouldn’t be. No one needs these wet noodle ballads. They’re inoffensive, sure, but they’re completely unnecessary. Not sure what made him turn down. \"],[22213,\"Elvis Presley died on August 16, 1977, about a month after he released Moody Blue. Like so many Elvis records before it, Moody Blue wasn’t assembled with care: it indiscriminately blended new studio sides with live tracks, some dating as far back as 1974. Early in Presley’s career, his manager Colonel Tom Parker—the huckster who took Presley under his wing in ’56—realized there wasn't much of a margin in art. He chose to industrialize the making of Elvis’ music. Parker minimized studio time but maximized releases, hustling Presley into the studio for marathon sessions where he’d record enough material for upwards of three albums. He instituted this practice not long after Elvis left the Army in 1960 and never abandoned it. Even the landmark From Elvis in Memphis, the 1969 record where Elvis reconnected with his muse, skimmed the surface of the Chips Moman-produced sessions at American Sound Studio. The rest of the recordings arrived months later as Back in Memphis, the studio portion of the double-LP From Memphis to Vegas\\/From Vegas to Memphis—a title so bewildering, it seems designed to confuse audiences. That word salad signals the utter indifference the Presley camp had toward presentation: the LPs were product, pure and simple. Parker and RCA spent so little time considering the construction of these releases; their very shoddiness suggested Elvis himself didn’t care much for making music. That isn’t true. After he reasserted control of the songs he sang in 1968—not to mention how the music sounded—Presley never quite let go of the artistic reins, even if he did make concessions to both the marketplace and Parker’s business demands. Presley’s artistry became obscured because his adoring fans would still snatch up tickets to live performances in Vegas and pick up LPs, never caring deeply about the content within. Decades of posthumous releases haven’t necessarily been kind to Presley, either. The sheer number of compilations have supported the notion that Elvis was merely a commodity to be sold. In the past few years, RCA\\/Legacy reconfigured Presley’s recordings according to session order, creating compilations that highlighted these concentrated bursts of energy. Way Down in the Jungle Room—a double disc set divided into a disc of master recordings and one of working renditions—is presumably the last of these. It focuses on the music Presley made primarily in February and October of 1976 at Graceland and doled out on 1976’s From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee, and Moody Blue. “Way Down,” a funky but forgotten rocker, was the biggest hit from these sessions, peaking at 18. “Moody Blue,” a single that turned into a perennial on oldies radio, topped out only at 31.The Jungle Room was the name given to the den adjacent to the kitchen in Graceland, Presley’s fabled Memphis home. The space earned its name due to its tacky Zebra-striped decor, kitsch that distracted from the fact that Elvis turned this room into a home recording studio early in 1976. At that time, Presley wanted to stick around Memphis due to health issues and a creeping domesticity. But by the mid-’70s, both American Sound Studio and Stax—where Presley recorded landmark sessions in the late ’60s and early ’70s, respectively—had shuttered, so he decided to dedicate a room in his mansion to music. Home studios were an indulgence befitting a superstar, but it also was cost effective, especially for a singer whose very career hinged on a trio of guys capturing lightning in a bottle at the tail end of a session. Nothing on Way Down in the Jungle Room approaches the kineticism of Elvis’ first single, 1954’s “That’s Alright Mama,” the late-night throwaway that altered the course of American culture. But that’s a high bar to clear. Rather, the looseness on Way Down in the Jungle Room reveals just how much Presley learned from Sam Phillips, a producer who prized surprise over polish. Certainly, the master takes on Way Down in the Jungle Room are plenty slick, but their essence lies in the jams heard on the second disc—a collection where Elvis cracks wise with a group of musicians who would soon become his rhythm section, the TCB Band (“Taking Care of Business”), along with invited guests. He smirks, “You guys don’t deserve me on the very first part” on “Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall;” he commands, “Bring out the booze... grandma” just before launching into “Never Again.” It’s all with the intention of pushing his band toward renditions he can hear in his head. These aren’t necessarily inventive—there’s not much that can be done to refresh the old Irish weeper “Danny Boy”—but sometimes they are. Take “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,” a Fred Rose tune popularized by Roy Acuff and Hank Williams but revived in a spare, sad version by Willie Nelson in 1975. Elvis trades melancholy for a slow-burning funk, not a million miles away from his deep soul rendition of “She Thinks I Still Care,” or how he turned Johnny Ace’s “Pledging My Love” into a roadhouse lament. These aren’t straight covers; these are interpretations, the work of an intuitive, intelligent singer who knows how to bend a lyric to serve his style. They’re also the gateway to the rest of Way Down in the Jungle Room, showing that even at its corniest moments—and this music is often silly and overblown because, Dean Martin fan that he was, Elvis never could resist heightened emotions—Presley understood the mechanics of a song and how to heighten a performance for maximum effect. At times he nodded toward mainstream trends. “Way Down” soars like a jetliner; “Moody Blue” co-opts every soft, hazy sound of AM pop in the mid-’70s. But the striking thing about Way Down in the Jungle Room is how it stays true to all the music Presley claimed as his own in ’68. Rockabilly isn’t heard much here—“For the Heart” has some swing, but nothing is breathless or reckless—still, there’s a clear, clean connection to the country, soul, and pop he blended in his ’68 comeback, just after he shook off the shackles of the soundtracks Parker imposed upon him. Perhaps there’s not an expansion of the sound, but there’s unquestionably a deepening of emotion, the sense that he’s a singer settling into his own bones. This maturity, this casual authority, is commanding. His performances often transcend the material, especially when schmaltz is infused with emotion: Neil Sedaka's “Solitaire” is given an operatic arrangement where Presley treats its broad lines like revelations. Like Frank Sinatra, Elvis threw himself into his music. Whatever he had, whether it was spruced up soul or manicured mellowness, Elvis invests himself into the song he’s singing. That passion is what distinguishes Way Down in the Jungle Room from the LPs culled from the same sessions. Here, in this double disc set, it’s apparent Elvis never stopped believing in the power and redemption of music, that he never stopped searching for the right song to sing.\"],[22208,\"Deep house, by definition, puts a premium on emotion, but even by those standards, Roman Flügel is an uncommonly expressive producer. His “How to Spread Lies,” from 2010, remains one of this decade's most effective pairings of melancholy moods and dance-floor kinetics; so is 2010’s “Brian Le Bon,” which borrows a musical phrase from Duran Duran’s “Save a Prayer,” of all things. Even when his more playful instincts take the lead—see, for instance, the tumbling arpeggios and dizzying percussive interplay of “Brasil,” or the blurry electro of “Cookie Dust,” which swerves like a spinning top—there’s a wistful undercurrent that sets him apart from less sensitive producers.Given the consistency of both his quality control and his emotional register, it can be easy to forget that Flügel is also one of house and techno’s most versatile musicians. In the ’90s, he spread his stylistic interests across a wide array of aliases—Eight Miles High, Soylent Green, Roman IV—along with his duo Alter Ego, with Jörn Elling Wuttke, and its various, well, alter egos (Acid Jesus, Holy Garage, Sensorama, et al). Deep house, acid, Frankfurt trance, and minimal techno have all figured in his playbook; with “Geht’s Noch?” and Alter Ego’s “Rocker,” he even added a bullet point for big, dumb rave anthems to his resume.His new EP for the Die Orakel label finds him continuing to break new stylistic ground—and working at the far extreme of his more misty-eyed house productions. Verschiebung is inscrutable, austere, and single-minded in its focus. The title is a German word that translates, depending upon the context, as “displacement,” “deferral,” “movement,” “shift,” or “drift,” and the music follows suit. What appear, at first, to be four smooth, muted takes on reductionist techno, with sonar pings skipping across the top of pitter-pat drum patterns, prove, upon closer inspection, to be far thornier constructions. Ostensibly repetitive patterns short circuit again and again, and looped phrases break and scatter into fragments. Yet, unlike someone like Autechre, say, it still preserves the illusion of frictionless forward glide.The four untitled tracks here are all variations upon a small, tightly controlled set of sounds—scratchy little hi-hats, rimshots, and tuned toms, overlaid with uneven bleeps evoking open car doors, or trucks backing up. There are no melodies, just stuttering patterns of queasily pitch-bent pings; minor keys predominate. It’s all resolutely analog, suggesting the sound of electricity pushing itself through wires—not so much dance music as impedance music. The most important element is the one you don't actually hear: the 16-step sequencer, or possibly sequencers, with which Flügel is controlling all his sounds. These are the machines that give his music is rippling sense of instability: By running patterns of different lengths against each other, and constantly manipulating his loops in real time, he turns out a softly tangled mess of sounds that just begs to be unraveled—yet switches up as soon as you've begun to tease out the specifics.Where most house and techno rarely let go of the four-to-the-floor handrail, these cuts drift freely atop the steady pulse, with strange time signatures and dub delay stretching the rhythmic grid until it begins to warp. “Verschiebung 1” comes closest to the steady groove of minimal techno, but trying to parse its elements is a nonstarter, and will quickly prove as easy as compiling a grocery list while stoned. On “Verschiebung 2,” triplets hammer against a beat counted off in intervals of seven; on “Verschiebung 3,” glassy pings pile up like colliding rings on the surface of a rain-spattered lake. The drum-free “Verschiebung 4,” the record’s most austere cut, clangs like something hammering on the hull of a submarine. Listeners looking for emotional payoff may be put off by the coldness of these tracks, but you can’t help but marvel at their focus. It’s a comparatively minor work for Flügel, but even marking time to a broken metronome, he stirs a powerful sense of unease.\"],[22202,\"Steven Caple Jr.’s the Land is the kind of movie that hip-hop once produced in abundance, but has shied away from in its corporate and commercial expansion. It’s a small and intimate coming-of-age story: four friends, avid skateboarders with dreams of going pro, get caught in the sights of a local drug baron after taking a risk they probably should have left alone. There’s not much original to the premise, but what makes it worth consideration are the small visual touches: a multi-chromatic cast that feels like real life as opposed to “diversity;” Caple’s eye, which lingers on small details and zooms out for moments of moving portraiture; and the setting—Cleveland, OH, a city pop culture forgot from the time Bone Thugs-N-Harmony left Uncle Charles at the crossroads up until LeBron James took his talents and a championship back to the city.The Land tells the type of story hip-hop was made for—Cleveland itself is a character, neither antagonist or protagonist, judge nor accomplice. The city just is—an unfeeling but not disconnected observer. It’s important to keep all this in mind when approaching the soundtrack to the film. Both were executive-produced by Nas—who is still making an argument for mature, textured rap a quarter century after being let out of a cage by the Main Source—and there’s a sense of nostalgia to everything here that treats the internal forces at play during life decisions with care and youthful wonder. In line with the movie’s meaning and ethos, these songs are incredibly topical and on-the-nose. Most play like cinematic scores—if their inclusion on a soundtrack didn’t announce these offerings as movie numbers, they’d still come off as backdrops to a larger tale, and the contributions seem happy to be bit players, never calling too much attention to themselves. Machine Gun Kelly’s rock-powered “Dopeman” is the adrenaline rush of copping drugs for resale; Stalley’s “Frequency High” is an interstitial moment of happiness that feels like the last sunny day before a storm; Nas and Erykah Badu’s “This Bitter Land” is a requiem for hope and a dirge for innocence with mournful strings that’s overly dramatic in another context, but understandable as a motion picture accompaniment. “Paid,” by Pusha T and Jeremih isn’t the sinister and abrasive coke talk that Pusha’s known for, but rather the kind of cautious social uplift he breaks into every once in a while to justify his choices. “The treasure’s inside of the trunk\\/Help momma with the first of the month\\/Baby mama get to buy what she want\\/Baby sister get to buy the free lunch\\/It goes down when the poverty’s up\\/See the difference is had to get it, no privilege,” he raps.   ",
